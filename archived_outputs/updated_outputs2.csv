ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"While microarray experiments generate voluminous data, discerning trends that support an existing or alternative paradigm is challenging. To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis. Thus, the PADMA database will be a useful resource to fly researchers to evaluate, revise, and refine hypotheses.","['Animals', 'Computational Biology', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']","Animal study, Biology, Computational biology, Immunoinformatics, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Computational biology'}","{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}","Animal study, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genomics, Laboratory animal science, Proteogenomics, Zoology",0.1,0.125,0.3333333333333333,"{'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Computational biology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Animal study'}","{'Microarray', 'Bioinformatics', 'Databases', 'Pathogen', 'Genomics', 'Hypothesis'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Infectious disease'}","Agricultural science, DNA, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Human biology, Human genetics, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Transcriptomics, Workflows",0.09523809523809523,0.16666666666666666,0.18181818181818182,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Machine learning', 'Human biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Genomics', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Chemistry, Developmental biology, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Laboratory animal science, Mouse clinic, Protein binding sites, Proteins, Small molecules, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics, Zoology",0.1,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,"{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Model organisms', 'Proteins', 'Cell biology', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}","{'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Animal study'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}"

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, RNA, Zoology",0.25,0.3333333333333333,0.5,"{'Neurology', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA'}","{'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science'}","{'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}","Carbon cycle, Chemistry, DNA replication and recombination, Data integration and warehousing, Evolutionary biology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Metagenomics, Microbial collection, Phylogeny",0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}"

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Critical care medicine', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Enzymes, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Proteogenomics, Proteomics, RNA, Zoology",0.15789473684210525,0.3,0.25,"{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Critical care medicine'}","{'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, DNA mutation, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Protein interactions, RNA, Zoology",0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}"

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads.

The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","Metagenomics, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}"

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetic engineering, Genetics, Human biology, Human genetics, Immunology, Sequence analysis",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genomics', 'Genetic network engineering'}"

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SD8i1on,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Drug discovery', 'Pathology', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}","Agricultural science, Bioinformatics, Computational biology, DNA, DNA binding sites, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Infectious disease, Plant biology, Protein binding sites, Proteins, Transcriptomics",0.15,0.25,0.2727272727272727,"{'Protein binding sites', 'RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Drug discovery', 'Pathology', 'Plant biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pathology', 'Drug discovery', 'Plant biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics'}"

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genomics', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Embryology'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Reproductive health, Sequence analysis, Software engineering, Systems medicine, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics, Zoology",0.15,0.1875,0.42857142857142855,"{'Genetic engineering', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Human genetics', 'Embryology', 'Genomics', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology'}","{'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Embryology', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Proteomics'}"

Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1).

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SD8i1on,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Software engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}","Biology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Human biology, Human genetics, Microbial ecology, Microbiology, Protein expression, Proteins",0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Software engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Software engineering', 'Proteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}"

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Infectious disease, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Proteogenomics, Proteomics, Zoology",0.1,0.2,0.16666666666666666,"{'RNA', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Proteins', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology'}"

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Preclinical and clinical studies, Proteins, Zoology",0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}"

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cell Polarity', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Ectoderm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neural Tube', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']","Animal study, Cell biology, DNA binding sites, DNA mutation, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Protein binding sites, Proteins, RNA, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study', 'Gene transcripts'}","Animal study, DNA mutation, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetic variation, Genetics, Laboratory animal science, Mapping, Mouse clinic, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Zoology",0.21052631578947367,0.3076923076923077,0.4,"{'Neurology', 'Proteins', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'DNA mutation', 'RNA', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Neurology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'Developmental biology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Neural tube defects', 'Craniofacial development', 'Neurobiology'}"

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","Antimicrobial Resistance, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Microbiology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Transcription factors and regulatory sites",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genomics', 'Genetic network engineering'}"

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Comparative genomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene transcripts'}","Agricultural science,Animal study,Comparative genomics,Developmental biology,Gene expression,Gene regulation,Genomics,Human biology,Human genetics,Plant biology,Sequence analysis,Transcriptomics",0.2777777777777778,0.4166666666666667,0.45454545454545453,"{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Genomics', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics'}"

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Embryology', 'Drug metabolism'}","Animal study, Cardiology, Copy number variation, DNA binding sites, Developmental biology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genomics, Laboratory animal science, Mouse clinic, Phylogenomics, Protein binding sites, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Transcription factors and regulatory sites",0.21052631578947367,0.25,0.5714285714285714,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Model organisms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}"

We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1).

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}","Animal study, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Microbiology, Microfluidics, Protein expression, Zoology",0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}"

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Cell biology, Infectious disease, Laboratory animal science, Microbiology, Mouse clinic, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Structural variation, Zoology",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Critical care medicine'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}"

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}","Animal study, Cell culture collection, DNA binding sites, DNA mutation, DNA polymorphism, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science",0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}","{'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}"

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cell Polarity', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Ectoderm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neural Tube', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']","Animal study, Cell biology, DNA binding sites, DNA mutation, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Protein binding sites, Proteins, RNA, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study', 'Mouse clinic'}","Animal study, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, Mapping, Mouse clinic, Protein binding sites, RNA, Sequence analysis, Sequence assembly, Zoology",0.15,0.23076923076923078,0.3,"{'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study', 'Mouse clinic'}","{'DNA mutation', 'RNA', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Enzymes', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study'}","{'Gene expression', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Neural tube defects', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'Craniofacial development', 'Neurobiology'}"

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}","Biomarkers, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}"

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6.

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}","Antimicrobial Resistance, Bacteria, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, Pathology, Probes and primers",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Genetic engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genetic network engineering'}"

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics'}","Agricultural science, Biochemistry, Biology, Biotechnology, Comparative genomics, Computational biology, DNA, Gene expression, Genetics, Genomics, Microbiology, Plant biology",0.15,0.25,0.2727272727272727,"{'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}",N/A,N/A
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Genetics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Stem cells', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Molecular genetics'}","Bioinformatics, Computational biology, Developmental biology, Epigenomics, Genetics, Genomics, Molecular biology, Molecular genetics, Mouse clinic, Multiomics, Proteomics, Systems biology, Transcriptomics, Cell biology, Cardiology, Epigenetics",0.09523809523809523,0.125,0.2857142857142857,"{'Regenerative medicine', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}","{'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A

We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1).

gpt-3.5-turbo,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system', 'Carbon cycle'}","Biochemistry, Biology, Environmental sciences, Genetics, Metabolomics, Microbiology, Molecular biology, Synthetic biology, Systems biology, Zoology",0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Microbiology', 'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}",N/A,N/A

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}","Biochemistry, Biology, Cell biology, Genetics, Genomics, Immunology, Infectious disease, Molecular biology, Proteomics, Virology",0.047619047619047616,0.1,0.08333333333333333,"{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}",N/A,N/A
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biotechnology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}","""Genetics, Genomics, Immunology, Oncology, Molecular biology, Cell biology, Hematology, Pharmacology, Bioinformatics""",0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates.

This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cell Polarity', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Ectoderm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neural Tube', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']","Animal study, Cell biology, DNA binding sites, DNA mutation, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Protein binding sites, Proteins, RNA, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Neural tube defects', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'Craniofacial development', 'Embryology', 'Neurobiology', 'Epigenetics'}","Genetics, Developmental biology, Molecular biology, Epigenetics, Neurobiology, Animal study, RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis, Gene pathways, Biomarkers, Epigenetic determinant, Craniofacial development, Neural tube closure, Mouse mutant",0.21052631578947367,0.3076923076923077,0.4,"{'RNA-Seq', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Neural tube defects', 'Craniofacial development', 'Embryology', 'Neurobiology', 'Epigenetics'}","{'Zoology', 'RNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Biology', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}","Microbiology, Geochemistry, Biogeochemistry",0.2,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,"{'Geochemistry', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}",N/A,N/A

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.
