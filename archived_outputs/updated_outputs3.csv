To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis. Thus, the PADMA database will be a useful resource to fly researchers to evaluate, revise, and refine hypotheses.","['Animals', 'Computational Biology', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']","Animal study, Biology, Computational biology, Immunoinformatics, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Computational biology'}","{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",0.1,0.125,0.3333333333333333,"{'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Computational biology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Animal study'}","{'Microarray', 'Bioinformatics', 'Databases', 'Pathogen', 'Genomics', 'Hypothesis'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Infectious disease'}",0.09523809523809523,0.16666666666666666,0.18181818181818182,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Machine learning', 'Human biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Genomics', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}",0.1,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,"{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Model organisms', 'Proteins', 'Cell biology', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}","{'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Animal study'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}",set()

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Animal study'}",0.25,0.3333333333333333,0.5,"{'Neurology', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA'}","{'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science'}","{'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}",0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}",set()

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Critical care medicine', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study'}",0.15789473684210525,0.3,0.25,"{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Critical care medicine'}","{'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}",0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}",set()

Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others.

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genomics', 'Genetic network engineering'}",set()

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SD8i1on,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Drug discovery', 'Pathology', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}",0.15,0.25,0.2727272727272727,"{'Protein binding sites', 'RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Drug discovery', 'Pathology', 'Plant biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pathology', 'Drug discovery', 'Plant biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics'}",set()

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genomics', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Embryology'}",0.15,0.1875,0.42857142857142855,"{'Genetic engineering', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Human genetics', 'Embryology', 'Genomics', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology'}","{'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Proteins', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Embryology', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Proteomics'}",set()

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Animal study'}",0.42857142857142855,0.5,0.75,"{'Animal study', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Proteins'}",{'Genetics'},"{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science'}","{'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SD8i1on,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Software engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}",0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Software engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Software engineering', 'Proteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}",set()

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics'}",0.1,0.2,0.16666666666666666,"{'RNA', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Proteins', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology'}",set()

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}",0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}",set()

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads.

The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Microbiology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}",0.2,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,"{'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6.

Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genomics', 'Genetic network engineering'}",set()

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Comparative genomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene transcripts'}",0.2777777777777778,0.4166666666666667,0.45454545454545453,"{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Genomics', 'Gene transcripts'}","{'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Infectious disease'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Embryology', 'Drug metabolism'}",0.21052631578947367,0.25,0.5714285714285714,"{'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Model organisms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}","{'Protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}",set()

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}",0.25,0.3333333333333333,0.5,"{'Animal study', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell biology'}","{'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics'}","{'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Laboratory animal science'}","{'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics'}",set()
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}",0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}",set()

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Critical care medicine'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}",set()

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}",0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}","{'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}",set()

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads.

We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Electron microscopy', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetics, Genotype and phenotype, Physiology, Plant biology, Protein variants","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}",0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Genetic engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Bacteria'}","{'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Microbial ecology'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genetic network engineering'}",{'Bacteria'}

To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA.

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics'}",0.15,0.25,0.2727272727272727,"{'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}",N/A,N/A,set()
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","Animal study, Cardiology, DNA, Electrocardiography, Embryology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genotype and phenotype, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sequence assembly, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Genetics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Stem cells', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Molecular genetics'}",0.09523809523809523,0.125,0.2857142857142857,"{'Regenerative medicine', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Stem cells', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}","{'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A,"{'Mouse clinic.', 'Stem cells'}"

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Animal study', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Molecular biology'}",0.1111111111111111,0.16666666666666666,0.25,"{'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Animal study'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}",N/A,N/A,{'Neuroscience'}
gpt-3.5-turbo,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","Carbohydrates, Carbon cycle, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Mobile genetic elements, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system', 'Carbon cycle'}",0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Microbiology', 'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}",N/A,N/A,"{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanotroph', 'Microcosm model system', 'Methanol'}"

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","Animal study, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Molecular modelling, Plant biology, Protein interactions, Proteins, Proteomics, Zoology","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}",0.047619047619047616,0.1,0.08333333333333333,"{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}",N/A,N/A,"{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Phosphorylation'}"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biotechnology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}",0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A,set()

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates.

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","['Animals', 'Biofilms/*growth & development', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Candida/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/*genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Fungal Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity']","Animal study, Biomarkers, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, RNA, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Microbiology', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Biomarkers', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Pathology'}","{'Hospital-acquired infection', 'Candida parapsilosis', 'Transcription factor Bcr1', 'Candida albicans', 'Biofilm formation', 'Iron acquisition', 'CFEM family'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'CFEM family', 'Hospital-acquired infection', 'Iron acquisition', 'Transcription factor Bcr1', 'Candida albicans', 'Biofilm formation', 'Candida parapsilosis'}","{'Microbiology', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Biomarkers', 'Genetics', 'Pathology', 'Drug metabolism'}",N/A,N/A,"{'CFEM family', 'Hospital-acquired infection', 'Iron acquisition', 'Transcription factor Bcr1', 'Candida albicans', 'Biofilm formation', 'Candida parapsilosis'}"

Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",0.2,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,"{'Geochemistry', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}",N/A,N/A,{'Geochemistry'}

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

gpt-4,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","Computer science, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Pathology, Plant biology, Protein structure analysis, Proteins, RNA, Rare diseases, Structural biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Proteins', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular biology', 'Plant biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Microbiology', 'Computational biology', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'DNA'}",0.25806451612903225,0.2857142857142857,0.7272727272727273,"{'Biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Plant biology', 'Molecular modelling', 'Proteomics', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biotechnology', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA'}","{'Chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Proteins', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Data mining', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Plant biology', 'Structural biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular modelling', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics', 'DNA'}",{'Data integration and warehousing'},"{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks'}"
gpt-4,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly',

gpt-4,"The annual migration of a bird can involve thousands of kilometres of nonstop flight, requiring accurately timed seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","['*Animal Migration', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression', 'Photoperiod', '*Seasons', 'Songbirds/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']","Animal study, Gene expression, Laboratory animal science, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'RNA', 'Biology', 'Data visualisation', 'Genetics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Animal study', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Protein properties', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data management', 'Quality affairs', 'Taxonomy', 'Data mining', 'Population genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Systems medicine', 'Genomics', 'Structure analysis', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Physiology', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Protein modifications', 'Structural biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Protein expression'}",0.06896551724137931,0.06896551724137931,1.0,"{'RNA', 'Biology', 'Data visualisation', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Animal study', 'Proteomics', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Sequence assembly', 'Protein properties', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data management', 'Quality affairs', 'Taxonomy', 'Data mining', 'Population genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Systems medicine', 'Genomics', 'Structure analysis', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Physiology', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Protein modifications', 'Structural biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Protein expression'}",set(),"{'RNA', 'Data visualisation', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Protein properties', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data management', 'Quality affairs', 'Taxonomy', 'Data mining', 'Population genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Systems medicine', 'Structure analysis', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Physiology', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Protein modifications', 'Structural biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Protein expression'}",{'Neuroscience'},"{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Protein sites, features and motifs'}"
gpt-4,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism',

gpt-4,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A

gpt-4,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","Animal study, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Preclinical and clinical studies, Sequence analysis, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genomic imprinting', 'Biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Haematology', 'Oncology', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence analysis', 'Immunogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Human biology', 'Systems biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression'}",0.1891891891891892,0.21212121212121213,0.6363636363636364,"{'Genomic imprinting', 'Biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Molecular biology', 'Haematology', 'Oncology', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Systems biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression'}","{'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Physiology'}","{'Genomic imprinting', 'Biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Haematology', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence analysis', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Human biology', 'Systems biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression'}","{'Biotechnology', 'Proteomics', 'Bioinformatics'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks'}"
gpt-4,"DNA recombination is required for effective segregation and diversification of genomes and for the successful completion of meiosis. Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Caenorhabditis/classification/*genetics', 'Chimera/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Hermaphroditic Organisms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Meiosis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment']","Animal study, Clone library, DNA replication and recombination, Evolutionary biology, Genetics, Genomics, Laboratory animal science, Model organisms, Zoology","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Gene structure', 'DNA', 'Proteins', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Genome evolution', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Computational biology', 'Nucleic acids', 'Sequence assembly', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Structural biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Structural genomics'}",0.08,0.08333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,"{'Gene structure', 'DNA', 'Proteins', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Genome evolution', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Computational biology', 'Nucleic acids', 'Sequence assembly', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Structural biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Structural genomics'}",{'Zoology'},"{'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Gene expression', 'Nucleic acids', 'Sequence assembly', 'Sequence analysis', 'Molecular genetics', 'Gene structure', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Computational biology', 'Structural biology', 'Structural genomics'}","{'Sequence homology', 'Hybrid incompatibilities', 'Sex evolution', 'Molecular basis'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Genome evolution'}"
gpt-4,"Newborns are frequently affected by mucocutaneous candidiasis. Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","['Age Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']","Cytogenetics, Human biology, Human genetics, Immunogenetics, Immunology, Immunomics, Protein interactions, Transcription factors and regulatory sites","{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics'}","{'DNA', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular biology', 'Functional genomics', 'Human genetics', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Paediatrics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Cell biology', 'Human biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Immunogenetics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Structural genomics'}",0.12903225806451613,0.13333333333333333,0.8,"{'DNA', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular biology', 'Functional genomics', 'Human genetics', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Paediatrics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Structural genomics'}",{'Drug metabolism'},"{'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Structural genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Functional genomics', 'Human genetics', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Paediatrics', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Human biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA'}","{'""Developmental biology""', '""Allergy', '""Biology""', 'clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics""', '""Pediatrics""', '""Molecular biology""', '""Genetics""', '""Immunology""', '""Cell biology""'}","{'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks'}"
gpt-4,"Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are implicated in tumor neovascularization, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence. Thus, the PAX6/DLX5-WNT5A axis governs the diffuse spread of glioma cells throughout the brain parenchyma, contributing to the lethality of GBM.","['Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein/*genetics']","Epigenetics, Epigenomics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genomics, Human biology, Human genetics, Proteins, Regenerative medicine","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Genomics', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Structural genomics', 'Translational medicine', 'Data visualisation', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Clinical data', 'Proteogenomics', 'Pathology', 'Data management', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Data mining', 'Epigenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Neurology', 'Gene structure', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genomics', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Systems biology', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Medical informatics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'DNA'}",0.1346153846153846,0.13725490196078433,0.875,"{'Structural genomics', 'Translational medicine', 'Data visualisation', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Clinical data', 'Proteogenomics', 'Data management', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Data mining', 'Epigenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Neurology', 'Gene structure', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Human genetics', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Systems biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Medical informatics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'DNA'}",{'Drug metabolism'},"{'Structural genomics', 'Data visualisation', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Neurobiology', 'Proteomics', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Machine learning', 'Cell biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene and protein families', 'Clinical data', 'Proteogenomics', 'Pathology', 'Data management', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Data mining', 'Epigenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Neurology', 'Gene structure', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Systems biology', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Medical informatics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Omics', 'Structural biology', 'Protein expression', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'DNA'}","{'Biotechnology', 'Biology', 'Bioinformatics'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Clinical data'}"
gpt-4,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cell Polarity', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Ectoderm/metabolism', 'Embryo,

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites.

Using a deep sequencing approach on RNA from infected chicken embryo fibroblast cultures, we identified several novel DEV-encoded micro (mi)RNAs. Unlike most mardivirus-encoded miRNAs, DEV-encoded miRNAs mapped mostly to the unique long region of the genome. The precursors of DEV miR-D18 and miR-D19 overlapped with each other, suggesting similarities to miRNA-offset RNAs, although only the DEV-miR-D18-3p was functional in reporter assays.

gpt-4,"Candida parapsilosis is a pathogenic fungus that is major cause of hospital-acquired infection, predominantly due to growth as biofilms on indwelling medical devices. It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","['Animals', 'Biofilms/*growth

gpt-4,"Dissipation kinetics of mesotrione, a new triketone herbicide, sprayed on soil from Limagne (Puy-de-Dôme, France) showed that the soil microflora were able to biotransform it. Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione. Among several metabolites formed, 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium. Although sulcotrione has a chemical structure closely resembling that of mesotrione, the isolates were unable to degrade it.","['Bacillus/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Cyclohexanones/*metabolism', 'Ecology/methods', 'Herbicides/*metabolism', '*Soil Microbiology', 'Soil Pollutants/*metabolism']","Biology, Ecology, Environmental sciences, Microbial ecology, Microbiology, Plant biology","{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Drug metabolism', 'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Soil science', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Ecology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Toxicology', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Microbiology', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Chemical biology', 'Cheminformatics', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'DNA', 'Carbon cycle'}",0.19047619047619047,0.2,0.8,"{'Chemistry', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'DNA', 'Soil science', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular genetics', 'Agricultural science', 'Molecular biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Chemical biology', 'Cheminformatics', 'Biochemistry', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Toxicology', 'Carbon cycle'}",{'Drug metabolism'},"{'Chemistry', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'DNA', 'Soil science', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Ecology', 'Biotechnology', 'Chemical biology', 'Cheminformatics', 'Biochemistry', 'Microbial ecology', 'Toxicology', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Bacteria', 'Soil', 'Biodegradation'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Soil science'}"

gpt-4,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","Data mining, RNA, Ribosome Profiling","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Chemistry', 'Geology', 'Biology', 'Data visualisation', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Microbial collection', 'Database management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence assembly', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data management', 'Taxonomy', 'Immunology', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Metabolomics', 'Structural biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Structural genomics'}",0.03773584905660377,0.038461538461538464,0.6666666666666666,"{'Chemistry', 'Geology', 'Biology', 'Data visualisation', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Microbial collection', 'Database management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence assembly', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data management', 'Taxonomy', 'Immunology', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Metabolomics', 'Structural biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Structural genomics'}",{'Drug metabolism'},"{'Chemistry', 'Geology', 'Biology', 'Data visualisation', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Microbial collection', 'Database management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Gene and protein families', 'Sequence assembly', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Data management', 'Taxonomy', 'Immunology', 'Natural language processing', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data acquisition', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Multiomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Informatics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Omics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Chemical biology', 'Metabolomics', 'Structural biology', 'Structural genomics'}",{'Geochemistry'},"{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Geology', 'Data architecture, analysis and design'}"

The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I.

gpt-4,"Diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involves blood cell counts, immunophenotyping, IgVH mutation status, and cytogenetic analyses. We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents,

gpt-4,"Adipocytes arise from the commitment and differentiation of adipose precursors in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.","['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/cytology/metabolism',

gpt-4,"Tumor suppressive microRNA (miR)-150 inhibits metastasis by combining with the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) ""seed sequence"" mRNA of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Panobinostat', 'Receptors, CCR6/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","Animal study, Cell biology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Human biology, Human genetics, Informatics, Laboratory animal science, Multiomics, Nucleic acids, Plant biology, Small molecules, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'RNA', 'Biology', 'Translational medicine', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Cell biology', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Drug discovery', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Pharmacology', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Gene regulation', 'Functional genomics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Informatics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug development'}",0.10256410256410256,0.11428571428571428,0.5,"{'RNA', 'Biology', 'Translational medicine', 'Molecular biology', 'Medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology', 'Genetic variation', 'Cell biology', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Drug discovery', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Data mining', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Functional genomics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Informatics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug development'}","{'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Pathology'}","{'RNA', 'Biology', 'Translational medicine', 'Medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteogenomics', 'Drug discovery', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Pharmacology', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biomedical science', 'Gene regulation', 'Functional genomics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Molecular medicine', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Informatics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug development'}","{'Cancer', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'Tumor suppressor', 'MicroRNA', 'Therapeutic targets', 'Migration', 'Chemokine receptor', 'Metastasis'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA'}"
gpt-4,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks',
