ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The transcriptome contains rich information on molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. However, experimental and statistical limitations constrain sensitivity and throughput of genetic screening with single-cell transcriptomics readout. To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq coverage on genes of interest, thereby increasing the sensitivity and scale of genetic screens by orders of magnitude. TAP-seq permits routine analysis of thousands of CRISPR-mediated perturbations within a single experiment, detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases sequencing requirements by up to 50-fold. We apply TAP-seq to generate perturbation-based enhancer-target gene maps for 1,778 enhancers within 2.5% of the human genome. We thereby show that enhancer-target association is jointly determined by three-dimensional contact frequency and epigenetic states, allowing accurate prediction of enhancer targets throughout the genome. In addition, we demonstrate that TAP-seq can identify cell subtypes with only 100 sequencing reads per cell.","['Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'RNA-Seq/*methods', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","['Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Structure prediction', 'Zoology']","['Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics']","Gene expression, Gene regulation, Mapping, Sequence analysis"

Using transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that there was little difference in the ultrastructure of Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula obtained by the two methods. However, significant differences in gene expression profiles were apparent when we used an oligonucleotide microarray to compare the gene expression profiles of schistosomula obtained in vivo from lung tissue with those maintained in vitro, and with adult worms of S. japonicum. It is likely that host environmental factors, which cannot be reliably reproduced in vitro, do influence the growth, development and overall biology of schistosomes.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Dysregulation of glutamate handling ensuing downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is implicated in excitotoxic degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 (a.k.a. GLT-1) is cleaved by caspase-3 at its cytosolic carboxy-terminus domain. This cleavage results in impaired glutamate transport activity and generates a proteolytic fragment (CTE) that we found to be post-translationally conjugated by SUMO1. We show here that this sumoylated CTE fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS at symptomatic stages of disease. Astrocytic expression of CTE, artificially tagged with SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1) to mimic the native sumoylated fragment, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation pattern of the endogenous EAAT2-derived proteolytic fragment. Moreover, in a co-culture binary system, expression of CTE-SUMO1 in spinal cord astrocytes initiates extrinsic toxicity by inducing caspase-3 activation in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells or axonal growth impairment in primary motor neurons. Interestingly, prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1 is intrinsically toxic to spinal cord astrocytes, although this gliotoxic effect of CTE-SUMO1 occurs later than the indirect, noncell autonomous toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a sumoylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could participate to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration.","['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Axons/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motor Neurons/*drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/toxicity', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1']","['Comparative genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic engineering', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics']","['Zoology', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Physiology']","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Drug metabolism, Laboratory animal science, Neurology, Pathology, Proteins, Sequence analysis, Zoology"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"During heat shock (HS) and other stresses, HS gene transcription in eukaryotes is up-regulated by the transcription factor heat shock factor (HSF). While the identities of the major HS genes have been known for more than 30 years, it has been suspected that HSF binds to numerous other genes and potentially regulates their transcription. In this study, we have used a chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) approach to identify 434 regions in the Drosophila genome that are bound by HSF. We have also performed a transcript analysis of heat shocked Kc167 cells and third instar larvae and compared them to HSF binding sites. The heat-induced transcription profiles were quite different between cells and larvae and surprisingly only about 10% of the genes associated with HSF binding sites show changed transcription. There were also genes that showed changes in transcript levels that did not appear to correlate with HSF binding sites. Analysis of the locations of the HSF binding sites revealed that 57% were contained within genes with approximately 2/3rds of these sites being in introns. We also found that the insulator protein, BEAF, has enriched binding prior to HS to promoters of genes that are bound by HSF upon HS but that are not transcriptionally induced during HS. When the genes associated with HSF binding sites in promoters were analyzed for gene ontology terms, categories such as stress response and transferase activity were enriched whereas analysis of genes having HSF binding sites in introns identified those categories plus ones related to developmental processes and reproduction. These results suggest that Drosophila HSF may be regulating many genes besides the known HS genes and that some of these genes may be regulated during non-stress conditions.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Drosophila Proteins/*chemistry', 'Drosophila melanogaster/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Insect', 'Genome', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Response/*genetics', 'Hot Temperature', 'Introns', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Carbohydrates', 'Carbon cycle', 'Genetics']","['Zoology', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry']","Animal study, Cell culture collection, DNA binding sites, Embryology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Gene transcripts, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Transcriptomics"

Genetic association studies have identified sequence variants in the gene BCL11A that influence HbF levels. Here, we examine BCL11A as a potential regulator of HbF expression. The high-HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the beta-globin gene cluster. BCL11A emerges as a therapeutic target for reactivation of HbF in beta-hemoglobin disorders.","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hemoglobinopathies/therapy', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'gamma-Globins/genetics/metabolism']","['Biophysics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Paediatrics', 'Plant biology', 'X-ray diffraction']","['Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Drug metabolism']","Cell biology, DNA binding sites, DNA mutation, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Haematology, Human biology, Human genetics, RNA, Sequence analysis"

In Ptt, nectaries represent constitutive organs with continuous merocrine nectar flow, nectary appearance, nectar production, and flow. In contrast, Ptr nectaries were found to be holocrine and inducible.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Exercise is extremely beneficial to whole body health reducing the risk of a number of chronic human diseases. Some of these physiological benefits appear to be mediated via the secretion of peptide/protein hormones into the blood stream. The plasma peptidome contains the entire complement of low molecular weight endogenous peptides derived from secretion, protease activity and PTMs, and is a rich source of hormones. In the current study we have quantified the effects of intense exercise on the plasma peptidome to identify novel exercise regulated secretory factors in humans. We developed an optimized 2D-LC-MS/MS method and used multiple fragmentation methods including HCD and EThcD to analyze endogenous peptides. This resulted in quantification of 5,548 unique peptides during a time course of exercise and recovery. The plasma peptidome underwent dynamic and large changes during exercise on a time-scale of minutes with many rapidly reversible following exercise cessation. Among acutely regulated peptides, many were known hormones including insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, bradykinin, cholecystokinin and secretogranins validating the method. Prediction of bioactive peptides regulated with exercise identified <i>C</i>-terminal peptides from Transgelins, which were increased in plasma during exercise. <i>In vitro</i> experiments using synthetic peptides identified a role for transgelin peptides on the regulation of cell-cycle, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration. We investigated the effects of exercise on the regulation of PTMs and proteolytic processing by building a site-specific network of protease/substrate activity. Collectively, our deep peptidomic analysis of plasma revealed that exercise rapidly modulates the circulation of hundreds of bioactive peptides through a network of proteases and PTMs. These findings illustrate that peptidomics is an ideal method for quantifying changes in circulating factors on a global scale in response to physiological perturbations such as exercise. This will likely be a key method for pinpointing exercise regulated factors that generate health benefits.","['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', '*Exercise', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/blood/chemistry', 'Muscle Proteins/blood/chemistry', 'Peptides/*analysis/blood', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteome/*chemistry', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Proteomics']","['Human biology', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry']","Electron microscopy, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Proteogenomics, Proteomics, Structural variation"

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an aggressive plasma cell neoplasm characterized by genomic heterogeneity. Superenhancers (SEs) are defined as large clusters of enhancers in close genomic proximity, which regulate genes for maintaining cellular identity and promote oncogenic transcription to which cancer cells highly addicted. Here, we analyzed cis-regulatory elements in MM samples with H3K27ac ChIP-seq, to identify novel SE-associated genes involved in the myeloma pathogenesis. SEs and their associated genes in cancerous tissue were compared with the control samples, and we found SE analysis alone uncovered cell-lineage-specific transcription factors and well-known oncogenes ST3GAL6 and ADM. Using a transcriptional CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, coupled with H3K27ac ChlP-seq, we identified MAGI2 as a novel SE-associated gene of myeloma cells. Elevated MAGI2 was related to myelomagenesis with gradual increased expression from MGUS, SMM to newly diagnosed and relapsed MM. High prevalence of MAGI2 was also associated with poor survival of MM patients. Importantly, inhibition of the SE activity associated with MAGI2 decreased MAGI2 expression, inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we revealed that the oncogenic transcription factor, MAF, directly bound to the SE region and activated gene transcription. In summary, the discoveries of these acquired SEs-associated genes and the novel mechanism by which they are regulated provide new insights into MM biology and MAGI2-MAF-SE regulatory circuit offer potential novel targets for disease treatment.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Guanylate Kinases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf/genetics']","['Cheminformatics', 'Chemometrics']","['Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Pathology']","Cell culture collection, DNA binding sites, Human biology, Human genetics, Pathology, Software engineering, Transcriptomics"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The product of the ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) gene, whose overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in myeloid leukemias and some epithelial tumors, regulates gene transcription both through direct DNA binding and through modulation of the activity of other sequence specific transcription factors. Previous results from our laboratory have shown that EVI1 influenced transcription regulation in response to the myeloid differentiation inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in a dual manner: it enhanced ATRA induced transcription of the RARβ gene, but repressed the ATRA induction of the EVI1 gene itself. In the present study, we asked whether EVI1 would modulate the ATRA regulation of a larger number of genes, as well as biological responses to this agent, in human myeloid cells. U937 and HL-60 cells ectopically expressing EVI1 through retroviral transduction were subjected to microarray based gene expression analysis, and to assays measuring cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These experiments showed that EVI1 modulated the ATRA response of several dozens of genes, and in fact reinforced it in the vast majority of cases. A particularly strong synergy between EVI1 and ATRA was observed for GDF15, which codes for a member of the TGF-β superfamily of cytokines. In line with the gene expression results, EVI1 enhanced cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to ATRA, and knockdown of GDF15 counteracted some of these effects.

We analyzed prostate cancer and corresponding benign tissues (n = 98) using microarrays. The comparison of high- and low-grade tumors (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 vs. ≤ 3 + 4) revealed 144 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05).

LysargiNase peptides are therefore practically tryptic-like in length and sequence except that following ESI, the two protons are now both positioned at the N-terminus.

Especially during ETD, LysargiNase peptides fragment into low-complexity but information-rich sequence ladders.

Epigenome studies often disregard the study of repeat elements owing to technical complexity and their undefined role in genome regulation. We have developed NSUMA (Next-generation Sequencing of UnMethylated Alu), a cost-effective approach allowing the unambiguous interrogation of DNA methylation in more than 130,000 individual Alu elements, the most abundant retrotransposon in the human genome. DNA methylation profiles of Alu repeats have been analyzed in colon cancers and normal tissues using NSUMA and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Normal cells show a low proportion of unmethylated Alu (1%-4%) that may increase up to 10-fold in cancer cells. In normal cells, unmethylated Alu elements tend to locate in the vicinity of functionally rich regions and display epigenetic features consistent with a direct impact on genome regulation. In cancer cells, Alu repeats are more resistant to hypomethylation than other retroelements. Genome segmentation based on high/low rates of Alu hypomethylation allows the identification of genomic compartments with differential genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features. Alu hypomethylated regions show low transcriptional activity, late DNA replication, and its extent is associated with higher chromosomal instability. Our analysis demonstrates that Alu retroelements contribute to define the epigenetic landscape of normal and cancer cells and provides a unique resource on the epigenetic dynamics of a principal, but largely unexplored, component of the primate genome.","['Alu Elements/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans']","['Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Cardiology', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Zoology']","['Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology']","DNA, Epigenetics, Epigenomics, Human biology, Human genetics, Mobile genetic elements, Sequence analysis"

The changes in gene expression levels were compared to differential gene expression profiles associated with positive and negative thymic selection. This analysis reveals that HDAC7 regulates an extensive set of genes that are differentially expressed during both positive and negative thymic selection. Many of these genes play important functional roles in thymic selection, primarily via modulating the coupling between antigen receptor engagement and downstream signaling events. Consistent with the model that HDAC7 may play an important role in both positive and negative thymic selection, the expression of distinct HDAC7 mutants or the abrogation of HDAC7 expression can either enhance or inhibit the signal-dependent differentiation of a CD4(+)/CD8(+) cell line.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Selection, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Computer science', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Drug metabolism']","Animal study, Cell culture collection, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Protein binding sites, Protein expression, Proteins, RNA, Software engineering, Zoology"

In this study we surveyed natural genomic variation in cytosine methylation among Arabidopsis thaliana wild accessions Columbia (Col) and Vancouver (Van) by comparing hybridization intensity difference between genomic DNA digested with either methylation-sensitive (HpaII) or -insensitive (MspI) restriction enzyme. Single Feature Polymorphisms (SFPs) were assayed on a full set of 1,683,620 unique features of Arabidopsis Tiling Array 1.0F (Affymetrix), while constitutive and polymorphic CG methylation were assayed on a subset of 54,519 features, which contain a 5'CCGG3' restriction site. 138,552 SFPs (1% FDR) were identified across enzyme treatments, which preferentially accumulated in pericentromeric regions. Our study also demonstrates that at least 8% of all analyzed CCGG sites were constitutively methylated across the two strains, while about 10% of all analyzed CCGG sites were differentially methylated between the two strains. Within euchromatin arms, both constitutive and polymorphic CG methylation accumulated in central regions of genes but under-represented toward the 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequences. Nevertheless, polymorphic methylation occurred much more frequently in gene ends than constitutive methylation. Inheritance of methylation polymorphisms in reciprocal F1 hybrids was predominantly additive, with F1 plants generally showing levels of methylation intermediate between the parents. By comparing gene expression profiles, using matched tissue samples, we found that magnitude of methylation polymorphism immediately upstream or downstream of the gene was inversely correlated with the degree of expression variation for that gene. In contrast, methylation polymorphism within genic region showed weak positive correlation with expression variation.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Heterosis is most frequently manifested by the substantially increased vigorous growth of hybrids compared with their parents. Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include <i>WUSCHEL</i>, <i>ARGOS</i>, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus-responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Biomass', 'Genome, Plant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Hybrid Vigor']","['DNA', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein interactions', 'Proteins', 'RNA']","['Plant biology', 'Genetics']","Genomics, Plant biology, Transcription factors and regulatory sites"

Deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has actually been reported in HCC patients following AFB1 exposure; however, no attempts have yet been made to investigate early effects on the epigenome level which may be persistent on longer term, thereby possibly initiating carcinogenic events.

For this, primary human hepatocytes were exposed to 0.3μM of AFB1 for 5 days. Persistent epigenetic effects were measured 3 days after terminating the carcinogenic exposure. Whole genome DNA methylation changes and whole genome transcriptomic analysis were analyzed applying microarray technologies, and cross-omics interactions were evaluated. Upon combining transcriptomics data with results on DNA methylation, a range of persistent hyper- and hypo-methylated genes was identified which also appeared affected on the transcriptome level. For six of the hypo-methylated and up-regulated genes, namely TXNRD1, PCNA, CCNK, DIAPH3, RAB27A and HIST1H2BF, a clear role in carcinogenic events could be identified.

We show that loss of neural stemness via inhibition of SETDB1, an oncoprotein with enriched expression in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis, led to neuronal differentiation with reduced tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential in neural stem and cancer cells, whereas enhancement of neural stemness by SETDB1 overexpression caused the opposite effects. SETDB1 maintains a regulatory network comprising proteins involved in developmental programs and basic cellular functional machineries, including epigenetic modifications (EZH2), ribosome biogenesis (RPS3), translation initiation (EIF4G), and spliceosome assembly (SF3B1); all of these proteins are enriched in embryonic neural cells and play active roles in cancers. In addition, SETDB1 represses the transcription of genes promoting differentiation and cell cycle and growth arrest. Serial transplantation of cancer cells showed that neural stemness, tumorigenicity, and pluripotent differentiation potential were simultaneously enhanced; these effects were accompanied by increased expression of proteins involved in developmental programs and basic machineries, including SETDB1 and the abovementioned proteins, as well as by increased alternative splicing events.

How early inflammation drives immunosuppression remains unclear. Although IFN-γ typically helps microbial clearance, we found that increased plasma IFN-γ in early clinical sepsis was associated with the later development of secondary Candida infection. Consistent with this observation, we found that exogenous IFN-γ suppressed macrophage phagocytosis of zymosan in vivo, and antibody blockade of IFN-γ after endotoxemia improved survival of secondary candidemia. Transcriptomic analysis of innate lymphocytes during endotoxemia suggested that NKT cells drove IFN-γ production by NK cells via mTORC1. Activation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells with glycolipid antigen drove immunosuppression. Deletion of iNKT cells in Cd1d-/- mice or inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin reduced immunosuppression and susceptibility to secondary Candida infection. Thus, although rapamycin is typically an immunosuppressive medication, in the context of sepsis, rapamycin has the opposite effect. These results implicated an NKT cell/mTOR/IFN-γ axis in immunosuppression following endotoxemia or sepsis. In summary, in vivo iNKT cells activated mTORC1 in NK cells to produce IFN-γ, which worsened macrophage phagocytosis, clearance of secondary Candida infection, and mortality.","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/genetics/immunology', 'Candida/immunology', 'Candidiasis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Sepsis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*immunology']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Protein interactions', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics']","['Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Pathology']","Animal study, Critical care medicine, Human biology, Human genetics, Laboratory animal science, Proteins, RNA, Regenerative medicine, Transcription factors and regulatory sites, Zoology"

However, active site residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis are absent, explaining the lack of enzymatic activity in previous analyses. Modelling of Tsr1 into cryo-electron microscopy maps of pre-40S particles shows that a highly acidic surface of Tsr1 is presented on the outside of pre-40S particles, potentially preventing premature binding to 60S subunits. Late pre-40S maturation also requires the GTPase eIF5B and the ATPase Rio1. The location of Tsr1 is predicted to block binding by both factors, strongly indicating that removal of Tsr1 is an essential step during cytoplasmic maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ribosome Subunits, Small, Eukaryotic/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Animal study', 'Dermatology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Mapping', 'Proteogenomics', 'Proteomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Zoology']","['X-ray diffraction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein structure analysis', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism']","Electron microscopy, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Human biology, Human genetics, Nucleic acids, Protein interactions, Proteins, Ribosome Profiling, Sequence analysis"

Hence, most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and the regulation of chloroplast functions includes nuclear transcriptional control. The expression profiles of 3292 nuclear Arabidopsis genes, most of them encoding chloroplast proteins, were determined from 101 different conditions and have been deposited at the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/) under . The 1590 most-regulated genes fell into 23 distinct groups of co-regulated genes (regulons). Genes of some regulons are not evenly distributed among the five Arabidopsis chromosomes and pairs of adjacent, co-expressed genes exist. Except regulons 1 and 2, regulons are heterogeneous and consist of genes coding for proteins with different subcellular locations or contributing to several biochemical functions. This implies that different organelles and/or metabolic pathways are co-ordinated at the nuclear transcriptional level, and a prototype for this is regulon 12 which contains genes with functions in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as genes associated with transport or transcription. The co-expression of nuclear genes coding for subunits of the photosystems or encoding proteins involved in the transcription/translation of plastome genes (particularly ribosome polypeptides) (regulons 1 and 2, respectively) implies the existence of a novel mechanism that co-ordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression and involves nuclear control of plastid ribosome abundance. The co-regulation of genes for photosystem and plastid ribosome proteins escapes a previously described general control of nuclear chloroplast proteins imposed by a transcriptional master switch, highlighting a mode of transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis which is different compared to other chloroplast functions.

Moreover, correlations between C. burnetii genomic groups and human disease presentation (acute versus chronic) have been described, suggesting that isolates have distinct virulence characteristics. To provide a more-complete understanding of C. burnetii's genetic diversity, evolution, and pathogenic potential, we deciphered the whole-genome sequences of the K (Q154) and G (Q212) human chronic endocarditis isolates and the naturally attenuated Dugway (5J108-111) rodent isolate. Cross-genome comparisons that included the previously sequenced Nine Mile (NM) reference isolate (RSA493) revealed both novel gene content and disparate collections of pseudogenes that may contribute to isolate virulence and other phenotypes. While C. burnetii genomes are highly syntenous, recombination between abundant insertion sequence (IS) elements has resulted in genome plasticity manifested as chromosomal rearrangement of syntenic blocks and DNA insertions/deletions. The numerous IS elements, genomic rearrangements, and pseudogenes of C. burnetii isolates are consistent with genome structures of other bacterial pathogens that have recently emerged from nonpathogens with expanded niches. The observation that the attenuated Dugway isolate has the largest genome with the fewest pseudogenes and IS elements suggests that this isolate's lineage is at an earlier stage of pathoadaptation than the NM, K, and G lineages.","['Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Bacterial', 'Coxiella burnetii/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virulence']","['Animal study', 'DNA', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Infectious disease', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Pathology', 'Protein interactions', 'Proteins', 'Rare diseases', 'Sequence analysis', 'Zoology']","['Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetic variation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Phylogeny', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism']","Comparative genomics, DNA replication and recombination, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Genetic variation, Genotype and phenotype, Human biology, Human genetics, Infectious disease, Pathology, Sequence analysis"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SD8i1on,"Understanding how the epigenetic blueprint of the genome shapes human phenotypes requires systematic evaluation of the complex interplay between gene activity and the different layers of the epigenome. Utilizing microarray-based techniques, we explored the relationships between DNA methylation, DNA replication timing and gene expression levels across a variety of human tissues and cell lines. The analyses revealed unequal methylation levels among early- and late-replicating fractions of the genome: late-replicating DNA was hypomethylated compared with early-replicating DNA. Moreover, late-replicating regions were gradually demethylated with cell divisions, whereas the methylation of early-replicating regions was better maintained. As active genes concentrate at early-replicating regions, they are overall hypermethylated relative to inactive genes. Accordingly, we show that the previously reported positive correlation between gene-body methylation (methylation of the transcribed portion of genes) and gene expression is restricted to proliferative tissues and cell lines, whereas in tissues containing few proliferating cells, active and inactive genes have similar methylation levels. We further show that active gene bodies are hypermethylated not only compared with inactive gene bodies, but also compared with their flanking sequences. This specific hypermethylation of the active gene bodies is severely disrupted in cells of an immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome patient bearing mutated DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B).

Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include <i>WUSCHEL</i>, <i>ARGOS</i>, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus-responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Biomass', 'Genome, Plant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Hybrid Vigor']","['DNA', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein interactions', 'Proteins', 'RNA']","['Plant biology', 'Genetics']","Gene expression, Gene regulation, Plant biology"

At this critical time, when the distal respiratory portion of the airways begins to form, microarray analysis showed that the most significantly differentially expressed miRNA was miR-449a. Prediction algorithms determined that N-myc is a target of miR-449a and identified the likely miR-449a:N-myc binding sites, confirmed by luciferase assays and targeted mutagenesis. Functional ex vivo knock-down in organ cultures of murine embryonic lungs, as well as in ovo overexpression in avian embryonic lungs, suggested a role for miR-449a in distal epithelial proliferation.

This study comprised of three sequential quantitative analyses: we investigated whether there is a generalizable correlation between the range of unique ions in a sample matrix (complexity); the amount of matrix components (concentration); and matrix effect, by comparing an E. coli digest matrix (∼2600 protein proteome) with phospholipid depleted human blood plasma, and unfractionated, nondepleted human plasma matrices (∼10(7) proteome) for six human plasma peptide multiple reaction monitoring assays. Our data set demonstrated analyte-specific interactions with matrix complexity and concentration properties resulting in significant ion suppression for all peptides (p < 0.01), with nonuniform effects on the ion signals of the analytes and their stable-isotope analogs. These matrix effects were then assessed for translation into relative residual error and precision effects in a low concentration (∼0-250 ng/ml) range across no-matrix, complex matrix, and highly complex matrix, when a standard addition stable isotope dilution calibration method was used. Relative residual error (%) and precision (CV%) by stable isotope dilution were within <20%; however, error in phospholipid-depleted and nondepleted plasma matrices were significantly higher compared with no-matrix (p = 0.006). Finally a novel reverse-polynomial dilution calibration method with and without phospholipid-depletion was compared with stable isotope dilution for relative residual error and precision. Reverse-polynomial dilution techniques extend the Lower Limit of Quantification and reduce error (p = 0.005) in low-concentration plasma peptide assays and is broadly applicable for verification phase Tier 2 multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring assay development within the FDA-National Cancer Institute (NCI) biomarker development pipeline.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calibration', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Indicator Dilution Techniques', 'Isotope Labeling', '*Limit of Detection', '*Models, Statistical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*blood/chemistry', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Mapping', 'Protein modifications', 'Proteins', 'Proteogenomics', 'Proteomics']","['Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism']","Antimicrobial Resistance, Drug metabolism, Proteins"

Here, a two-cohort microbiome-genome wide association study is presented through which patient genomic loci associated with chronic wound microbiome diversity were identified. Further investigation revealed that alternative TLN2 and ZNF521 genotypes explained significant inter-patient variation in relative abundance of two key pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wound diversity was lowest in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected wounds, and decreasing wound diversity had a significant negative linear relationship with healing rate. In addition to microbiome characteristics, age, diabetic status, and genetic ancestry all significantly influenced healing. Using structural equation modeling to identify common variance among SNPs, six loci were sufficient to explain 53% of variation in wound microbiome diversity, which was a 10% increase over traditional multiple regression. Focusing on TLN2, genotype at rs8031916 explained expression differences of alternative transcripts that differ in inclusion of important focal adhesion binding domains. Such differences are hypothesized to relate to wound microbiomes and healing through effects on bacterial exploitation of focal adhesions and/or cellular migration. Related, other associated loci were functionally enriched, often with roles in cytoskeletal dynamics. This study, being the first to identify patient genetic determinants for wound microbiomes and healing, implicates genetic variation determining cellular adhesion phenotypes as important drivers of infection type. The identification of predictive biomarkers for chronic wound microbiomes may serve as risk factors and guide treatment by informing patient-specific tendencies of infection.","['Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Microbiota', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Pseudomonas Infections/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa', '*Staphylococcal Infections/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', '*Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'Talin/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wound Healing/*genetics', '*Wound Infection/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology']","['Epigenetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Paediatrics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein modifications', 'Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Pathology']","Antimicrobial Resistance, Genetic variation, Genomics, Genotype and phenotype, Human biology, Human genetics, Infectious disease, Laboratory animal science, Microbial collection, Microbial ecology, Microbiology, Pain medicine, Protein binding sites, Regenerative medicine, Wound healing"

Yeast ARV1 mutants accumulate multiple lipids in the ER and are sensitive to pharmacological modulators of both sterol and sphingolipid metabolism. Using fluorescent and electron microscopy, we demonstrate sterol accumulation, subcellular membrane expansion, elevated lipid droplet formation, and vacuolar fragmentation in ARV1 mutants. Motif-based regression analysis of ARV1 deletion transcription profiles indicates activation of Hac1p, an integral component of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Accordingly, we show constitutive splicing of HAC1 transcripts, induction of a UPR reporter, and elevated expression of UPR targets in ARV1 mutants. IRE1, encoding the unfolded protein sensor in the ER lumen, exhibits a lethal genetic interaction with ARV1, indicating a viability requirement for the UPR in cells lacking ARV1. Surprisingly, ARV1 mutants expressing a variant of Ire1p defective in sensing unfolded proteins are viable. Moreover, these strains also exhibit constitutive HAC1 splicing that interacts with DTT-mediated perturbation of protein folding. These data suggest that a component of UPR induction in arv1Δ strains is distinct from protein misfolding. Decreased ARV1 expression in murine macrophages also results in UPR induction, particularly up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4, CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and apoptosis. Cholesterol loading or inhibition of cholesterol esterification further elevated CHOP expression in ARV1 knockdown cells. Thus, loss or down-regulation of ARV1 disturbs membrane and lipid homeostasis, resulting in a disruption of ER integrity, one consequence of which is induction of the UPR.","['Activating Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunoblotting', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*genetics']","['Animal study', 'DNA mutation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Proteins', 'Zoology']","['Zoology', 'Computational biology', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Electron microscopy', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism']","Animal study, Biobank, Chemometrics, Cytogenetics, Laboratory animal science, Membrane and lipoproteins, Nucleic acids, Protein binding sites, Protein expression, Proteins, Regenerative medicine, Sample collections, Small molecules, Zoology"

MDSCs can be produced in great numbers for cellular therapy, but they present a mixture of subsets whose functions in GVHD prevention are undefined. Here, we generated MDSCs <i>in vitro</i> from murine BM cells in the presence of GM-CSF and defined the integrin CD11c as a marker to subdivide MDSCs into two functional subgroups: CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs. Isolated CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs both inhibited alloantigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i>, although CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs were more efficient and expressed higher levels of different immunosuppressive molecules. Likewise, expression of surface markers such as MHC class II, CD80, CD86, or PD-L1 further delineated both subsets. Most importantly, only the adoptive transfer of CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs into a single MHC class I-disparate allogeneic BMT model prevented GVHD development and strongly decreased disease-induced mortality, while CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs were totally ineffective. Surprisingly, allogeneic T-cell homing and expansion in lymphatic and GVHD target organs were not affected by cotransplanted CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs indicating a clear contradiction between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> functions of MDSCs. However, CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs shifted immune responses towards type 2 immunity reflected by increased Th2-specific cytokine expression of allogeneic T cells. Induction of type 2 immunity was mandatory for GVHD prevention, since CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs were ineffective if recipients were reconstituted with STAT6-deficient T cells unable to differentiate into Th2 cells. Most importantly, the beneficial graft- <i>versus</i> -tumor (GVT) effect was maintained in the presence of CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs since syngeneic tumor cells were efficiently eradicated. Strong differences in the transcriptomic landscape of both subpopulations underlined their functional differences.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Progesterone (P4) signaling through its nuclear transcription factor, the progesterone receptor (PR), is essential for normal uterine function. Although deregulation of PR-mediated signaling is known to underscore uterine dysfunction and a number of endometrial pathologies, the early molecular mechanisms of this deregulation are unclear. To address this issue, we have defined the genome-wide PR cistrome in the murine uterus using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). In uteri of ovariectomized mice, we identified 6367 PR-binding sites in the absence of P4 ligand; however, this number increased at nearly 3-fold (18,432) after acute P4 exposure. Sequence analysis revealed that approximately 73% of these binding sites contain a progesterone response element or a half-site motif recognized by the PR. Many previously identified P4 target genes known to regulate uterine function were found to contain PR-binding sites, confirming the validity of our methodology. Interestingly, when the ChIP-seq data were coupled with our microarray expression data, we identified a novel regulatory role for uterine P4 in circadian rhythm gene expression, thereby uncovering a hitherto unexpected new circadian biology for P4 in this tissue. Further mining of the ChIP-seq data revealed Sox17 as a direct transcriptional PR target gene in the uterus. As a member of the Sox transcription factor family, Sox17 represents a potentially novel mediator of PR action in the murine uterus. Collectively, our first line of analysis of the uterine PR cistrome provides the first insights into the early molecular mechanisms that underpin normal uterine responsiveness to acute P4 exposure. Future analysis promises to reveal the PR interactome and, in turn, potential therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and/or treatment of endometrial dysfunction.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Female', 'Genome', 'HMGB Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Progesterone/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Uterus/*metabolism']","['Animal study', 'Drug metabolism', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Proteins', 'Zoology']","['Zoology', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcriptomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology']","Animal study, DNA binding sites, Endocrinology and metabolism, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Laboratory animal science, Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs, Probes and primers, Protein binding sites, Regenerative medicine, Reproductive health, Sequence analysis, Zoology"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to infectious mononucleosis and several human cancers. EBV encodes a conserved protein kinase BGLF4 that plays a key role in the viral life cycle. To provide new insight into the host proteins regulated by BGLF4, we utilized stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics to compare site-specific phosphorylation in BGLF4-expressing Akata B cells. Our analysis revealed BGLF4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of 3,046 unique sites corresponding to 1,328 proteins. Frequency analysis of these phosphosites revealed a proline-rich motif signature downstream of BGLF4, indicating a broader substrate recognition for BGLF4 than its cellular ortholog cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Further, motif analysis of the hyperphosphorylated sites revealed enrichment in ATM, ATR and Aurora kinase substrates while functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to the DNA damage response (DDR), mitosis and cell cycle. Phosphorylation of proteins associated with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) indicated checkpoint activation, an event that inactivates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, APC/C. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BGLF4 binds to and directly phosphorylates the key cellular proteins PP1, MPS1 and CDC20 that lie upstream of SAC activation and APC/C inhibition. Consistent with APC/C inactivation, we found that BGLF4 stabilizes the expression of many known APC/C substrates. We also noted hyperphosphorylation of 22 proteins associated the nuclear pore complex, which may contribute to nuclear pore disassembly and SAC activation. A drug that inhibits mitotic checkpoint activation also suppressed the accumulation of extracellular EBV virus. Taken together, our data reveal that, in addition to the DDR, manipulation of mitotic kinase signaling and SAC activation are mechanisms associated with lytic EBV replication.

We determined that the gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), which is the ligand for the BMP family, is recurrently amplified and transcriptionally upregulated in melanoma. GDF6-induced BMP signaling maintained a trunk neural crest gene signature in melanomas. Additionally, GDF6 repressed the melanocyte differentiation gene MITF and the proapoptotic factor SOX9, thereby preventing differentiation, inhibiting cell death, and promoting tumor growth. GDF6 was specifically expressed in melanomas but not melanocytes. Moreover, GDF6 expression levels in melanomas were inversely correlated with patient survival.

We show that both tumor cell lines coexpress FGFRs and ligands and display autocrine FGFR signaling activity. Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), a downstream mediator of FGFR, is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and multiple signaling pathways are active. Treatment of 67NR and 4T1 cultures with TKI258, an FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), caused a rapid decrease in FRS2 phosphorylation; decreased the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, and phospholipase Cgamma; and blocked proliferation of both tumor lines. Furthermore, TKI258 induced 4T1 apoptotic cell death via blockade of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, one dose of TKI258 rapidly lowered FRS2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 and AKT activity in mammary tumors. Long-term TKI258 treatment of 4T1 tumor- and 67NR tumor-bearing mice had a significant effect on primary tumor outgrowth and 4T1 tumor-induced lung metastases.

We generated C. acnes-specific antimicrobial TH17 clones (AMTH17) with varying antimicrobial activity against C. acnes, which we correlated by RNA sequencing to the expression of transcripts encoding proteins that contribute to antimicrobial activity. Additionally, we validated that AMTH17-mediated killing of C. acnes and bacterial pathogens was dependent on the secretion of granulysin, granzyme B, perforin, and histone H2B. We found that AMTH17 cells can release fibrous structures composed of DNA decorated with histone H2B that entangle C. acnes that we call T cell extracellular traps (TETs). Within acne lesions, H2B and IL-17 colocalized in CD4+ T cells, in proximity to TETs in the extracellular space composed of DNA decorated with H2B.

Lymph node LEC (LN-LEC) also have been shown to have important immunological functions that are not observed in LEC from tissue lymphatics. LN-LEC can maintain peripheral tolerance through direct presentation of self-antigen via MHC-I, leading to CD8 T cell deletion; and through transfer of self-antigen to dendritic cells for presentation via MHC-II, resulting in CD4 T cell anergy. LN-LEC also can capture and archive foreign antigens, transferring them to dendritic cells for maintenance of memory CD8 T cells. The molecular basis for these functional elaborations in LN-LEC remain largely unexplored, and it is also unclear whether blood endothelial cells in LN (LN-BEC) might express similar enhanced immunologic functionality.

On the basis of the available structural and biochemical information, we develop a physically plausible model of the receptor binding and activation, which is based on the concept of a harmonic oscillator. Modelling a network of interactions among all possible receptor intermediaries arising in the context of the model (35, for the insulin receptor) accurately reproduces for the first time all the kinetic properties of the receptor, and provides unique and robust estimates of the kinetic parameters. The harmonic oscillator model may be adaptable for many other dimeric/dimerizing receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors where ligand crosslinking occurs.","['*Allosteric Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism']","['Biochemistry', 'Biomarkers', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Transcriptomics']","['Biology', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Drug metabolism']","Enzymes, Human biology, Human genetics, Protein binding sites, Protein interactions, Proteins"

We now report that this involves activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and induction of STAT1-regulated genes and that this process is inhibited by active caspases. STAT1 is enriched in CSCs in cancer cell lines, patient-derived human breast cancer, and CD95<sup>high</sup>-expressing glioblastoma neurospheres. CD95 stimulation of cancer cells induced secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) that bind to type I IFN receptors, resulting in activation of Janus-activated kinases, activation of STAT1, and induction of a number of STAT1-regulated genes that are part of a gene signature recently linked to therapy resistance in five primary human cancers. Consequently, we identified type I IFNs as drivers of cancer stemness. Knockdown or knockout of STAT1 resulted in a strongly reduced ability of CD95L or type I IFN to increase cancer stemness. This identifies STAT1 as a key regulator of the CSC-inducing activity of CD95.","['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']","['DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA']","['Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology']","Biobank, Genomics, Human biology, Human genetics, Proteins, Sequence analysis"

Loss of MPP9 causes abnormal primary cilia formation in growing cells and mouse kidneys. After phosphorylation by Tau Tubulin Kinase 2 (TTBK2) at the beginning of ciliogenesis, MPP9 is targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which facilitates the removal of CP110 and CEP97 from the distal end of the mother centriole.

Inhibition of Trpm4 expression increased Ca(2+) influx and oscillatory levels in Th2 cells and decreased influx and oscillations in Th1 cells. This inhibition of Trpm4 expression also significantly altered T cell cytokine production and motility. Our experiments revealed that decreasing Trpm4 levels divergently regulates nuclear localization of NFATc1.

How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency.

Mediator is a large coactivator complex that bridges enhancer-localized transcription factors with promoters, but little is known about Mediator function in adult stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We show that MED12, a member of the Mediator kinase module, is an essential regulator of HSC homeostasis, as in vivo deletion of Med12 causes rapid bone marrow aplasia leading to acute lethality. Deleting other members of the Mediator kinase module does not affect HSC function, suggesting kinase-independent roles of MED12. MED12 deletion destabilizes P300 binding at lineage-specific enhancers, resulting in H3K27Ac depletion, enhancer de-activation, and consequent loss of HSC stemness signatures.

This peptide exhibits no cellular lytic activity, but electron microscopy and fluorescence studies reveal an ability to selectively disrupt the OM but not the inner membrane of E. coli. The selective targeting of the OM probably occurs through interactions of JB-95 with selected β-barrel OM proteins, including BamA and LptD as shown by photolabeling experiments. Membrane proteomic studies reveal rapid depletion of many β-barrel OM proteins from JB-95-treated E. coli, consistent with induction of a membrane stress response and/or direct inhibition of the Bam folding machine. The results suggest that lethal disruption of the OM by JB-95 occurs through a novel mechanism of action at key interaction sites within clusters of β-barrel proteins in the OM.

Here, we identified the lysosomal endoribonuclease RNase T2 as a non-redundant upstream component of TLR8-dependent RNA recognition. RNase T2 activity is required for rendering complex single-stranded, exogenous RNA molecules detectable for TLR8. This is due to RNase T2's preferential cleavage of single-stranded RNA molecules between purine and uridine residues, which critically contributes to the supply of catabolic uridine and the generation of purine-2',3'-cyclophosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides.

As herbivores, pollinators, and prey, Lepidoptera play a fundamental role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Lepidoptera are also indicators of environmental change and serve as models for research on mimicry and genetics. They have been central to the development of coevolutionary hypotheses, such as butterflies with flowering plants and moths' evolutionary arms race with echolocating bats. However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested, because a robust lepidopteran phylogeny and timing of evolutionary novelties are lacking. To address these issues, we inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Lepidoptera, using the largest dataset assembled for the order (2,098 orthologous protein-coding genes from transcriptomes of 186 species, representing nearly all superfamilies), and dated it with carefully evaluated synapomorphy-based fossils. The oldest members of the Lepidoptera crown group appeared in the Late Carboniferous (∼300 Ma) and fed on nonvascular land plants. Lepidoptera evolved the tube-like proboscis in the Middle Triassic (∼241 Ma), which allowed them to acquire nectar from flowering plants. This morphological innovation, along with other traits, likely promoted the extraordinary diversification of superfamily-level lepidopteran crown groups. The ancestor of butterflies was likely nocturnal, and our results indicate that butterflies became day-flying in the Late Cretaceous (∼98 Ma). Moth hearing organs arose multiple times before the evolutionary arms race between moths and bats, perhaps initially detecting a wide range of sound frequencies before being co-opted to specifically detect bat sonar.

P2Y12 inhibitors are among the most successful antiplatelet drugs, however, show remarkable variability in efficacy. We reasoned whether a more detailed molecular understanding of ADP-induced protein phosphorylation could identify (1) critical hubs in platelet signaling toward aggregation and (2) novel molecular targets for antiplatelet treatment strategies.

Furthermore, to mimic the antagonistic efficacy of endothelial-derived prostacyclin, we determined how Iloprost reverses ADP-mediated signaling events. We provide temporal profiles of 4797 phosphopeptides, 608 of which showed significant regulation.

Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural changes following this therapy. Further identification of the specific community members and functions that promote colonization resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difficile infection.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteria/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Biological Therapy', 'Clostridioides difficile/*physiology', 'Clostridium Infections/microbiology/*therapy', 'Feces/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Microbiota', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny']","['Biology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein interactions']","['Human biology', 'Phylogeny', 'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Physiology']","Bioinformatics, Microbiology, Metagenomics, Functional genomics, Infectious disease, Antibiotic therapy, Microbiota, Fecal microbiota transplantation, Colonization resistance, C. difficile infection"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"The NS1 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a multifunctional virulence factor. We have previously characterized gain-of-function mutations in the NS1 protein arising from the experimental adaptation of the human isolate A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) (HK) to the mouse. The majority of these mouse adapted NS1 mutations were demonstrated to increase virulence, viral fitness, and interferon antagonism, but differ in binding to the post-transcriptional processing factor cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30). Because nuclear trafficking is a major genetic determinant of influenza virus host adaptation, we assessed subcellular localization and host gene expression of NS1 adaptive mutations. Recombinant HK viruses with adaptive mutations in the NS1 gene were assessed for NS1 protein subcellular localization in mouse and human cells using confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation. In human cells the HK wild-type (HK-wt) virus NS1 protein partitioned equivalently between the cytoplasm and nucleus but was defective in cytoplasmic localization in mouse cells. Several adaptive mutations increased the proportion of NS1 in the cytoplasm of mouse cells with the greatest effects for mutations M106I and D125G. The host gene expression profile of the adaptive mutants was determined by microarray analysis of infected mouse cells to show either high or low extents of host-gene regulation (HGR or LGR) phenotypes. While host genes were predominantly down regulated for the HGR group of mutants (D2N, V23A, F103L, M106I+L98S, L98S, M106V, and M106V+M124I), the LGR phenotype mutants (D125G, M106I, V180A, V226I, and R227K) were characterized by a predominant up regulation of host genes. CPSF30 binding affinity of NS1 mutants did not predict effects on host gene expression. To our knowledge this is the first report of roles of adaptive NS1 mutations that impact intracellular localization and regulation of host gene expression.","['Adaptation, Biological/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Densitometry', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['Animal study', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Informatics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Multiomics', 'Nucleic acids', 'Plant biology', 'Small molecules', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Zoology']","['Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Electron microscopy', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism']","Biochemistry, Cell biology, Genetics, Immunology, Microbiology, Molecular biology, Molecular genetics, Virology, Host-gene regulation, Intracellular localization, Virulence, Nuclear trafficking, Subcellular localization"

The gene expression profile of each metabolic state was distinguishable from CTRLs and correlated with other metabolic states more than with RA. Of note, subjects in the metabolic cohorts overexpressed gene sets that participate in the innate immune response. Genes involved in activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, were overexpressed in CAD whereas genes differentially expressed in T2D have key roles in T-cell activation and signaling. Reverse transcriptase PCR validation confirmed microarray results. Furthermore, several genes differentially expressed in human metabolic disorders have been previously shown to participate in inflammatory responses in murine models of obesity and T2D. Taken together, these data demonstrate that peripheral blood from individuals with metabolic disorders display overlapping and non-overlapping patterns of gene expression indicative of unique, underlying immune processes.","['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Disease/*genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Sequence analysis']","['Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Genetics']","""Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics"", ""Cardiology"", ""Diabetes and metabolic disorders"", ""Genomics"", ""Immunology"", ""Molecular biology"""
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Histone acetylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression in plants and eukaryotes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones, which is associated with the repression of gene expression. To study the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression during seed germination, trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was used to treat imbibing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. GeneChip arrays were used to show that TSA induces up-regulation of 45 genes and down-regulation of 27 genes during seed germination. Eight TSA-up-regulated genes were selected for further analysis - RAB18, RD29B, ATEM1, HSP70 and four late embryogenesis abundant protein genes (LEA). A gene expression time course shows that these eight genes are expressed at high levels in the dry seed and repressed upon seed imbibition at an exponential rate. In the presence of TSA, the onset of repression of the eight genes is not affected but the final level of repressed expression is elevated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and HDAC assays show that there is a transient histone deacetylation event during seed germination at 1 day after imbibition, which serves as a key developmental signal that affects the repression of the eight genes.","['Acetylation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arabidopsis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Germination', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']","['Proteogenomics', 'Proteomics']","['DNA', 'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Plant biology', 'RNA', 'Complementary medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism']","Epigenetics, Gene expression, Gene regulation, Histone acetylation, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, Histone deacetylases, Seed germination, GeneChip arrays, Gene repression"

Here, we perform a genome-wide comparative analysis of patterns of accelerated evolution in species with highly distinctive traits to discover candidate functional elements for clinically important phenotypes. We identify accelerated regions (ARs) in the elephant, hibernating bat, orca, dolphin, naked mole rat, and thirteen-lined ground squirrel lineages in mammalian conserved regions, uncovering ∼33,000 elements that bind hundreds of different regulatory proteins in humans and mice. ARs in the elephant, the largest land mammal, are uniquely enriched near elephant DNA damage response genes. The genomic hotspot for elephant ARs is the E3 ligase subunit of the Fanconi anemia complex, a master regulator of DNA repair.

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) methyltransferases and their cofactors are essential for embryonic development and the establishment of gene expression patterns in a cell-specific and heritable manner. However, the importance of such epigenetic marks in maintaining gene expression in adults and in initiating human disease is unclear. Here, we addressed this question using a mouse model in which we could inducibly ablate PAX interacting (with transcription-activation domain) protein 1 (PTIP), a key component of the H3K4me complex, in cardiac cells. Reducing H3K4me3 marks in differentiated cardiomyocytes was sufficient to alter gene expression profiles. One gene regulated by H3K4me3 was Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (Kcnip2), which regulates a cardiac repolarization current that is downregulated in heart failure and functions in arrhythmogenesis. This regulation led to a decreased sodium current and action potential upstroke velocity and significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD). The prolonged APD augmented intracellular calcium and in vivo systolic heart function. Treatment with isoproterenol and caffeine in this mouse model resulted in the generation of premature ventricular beats, a harbinger of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. These results suggest that the maintenance of H3K4me3 marks is necessary for the stability of a transcriptional program in differentiated cells and point to an essential function for H3K4me3 epigenetic marks in cellular homeostasis.","['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kv Channel-Interacting Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ventricular Premature Complexes']","['Animal study', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Genetic variation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Molecular evolution', 'Pathology', 'Phylogeny', 'Rare diseases', 'Zoology']","['Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology']","Biochemistry, Biology, Biomedical science, Cardiology, Cell biology, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Genetics, Genomics, Molecular biology, Molecular medicine, Physiology"

However, whether alterations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, affects higher-order levels of genome architecture is still unclear. Here, using Repli-Seq, single-cell Repli-Seq, and Hi-C, we show that genome-wide methylation loss is associated with both concordant loss of replication timing precision and deregulation of 3D genome organization. Notably, we find distinct disruption in 3D genome compartmentalization, striking gains in cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of allelic replication timing in cancer hypomethylation models, potentially through the gene deregulation of DNA replication and genome organization pathways. Finally, we identify ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains from across large hypomethylated domains, where late replication is maintained, which we purport serves to protect against catastrophic genome reorganization and aberrant gene transcription. Our results highlight a potential role for the methylome in the maintenance of 3D genome regulation.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Replication Timing/*physiology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', '*Genome, Human', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']","['Animal study', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Transcriptomics', 'Zoology']","['Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology']","Epigenetics, DNA replication and recombination, Genomics, Gene regulation, Molecular interactions, pathways and networks"

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Using the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, we generated a gene expression profile of the rat hippocampus. A total of 76,790 SAGE tags was analyzed, allowing identification of 28,748 different tag species, each representing a unique mRNA transcript. The tags were divided into different abundancy classes, ranging from tags that were detected over 500 times to tags encountered only once in the 76,790 tags analyzed. The mRNA species detected more than 50 times represented 0.3% of the total number of unique tags while accounting for 22% of the total hippocampal mRNA mass. The majority of tags were encountered 5 times or less. The genes expressed at the highest levels were of mitochondrial origin, consistent with a high requirement for energy in neuronal tissue. At a lower level of expression, several neuron-specific transcripts were encountered, encoding various neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and turnover, ion channels and pumps, and synaptic components. Comparison of relative expression levels demonstrated that glutamate receptors are the most frequent neurotransmitter receptors expressed in the hippocampus, consistent with the important role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, while GABA receptors were present at approximately 10-fold lower levels. Several kinases were present including CaMKII, which was expressed at high levels, consistent with its being the most abundant protein in the spines of hippocampal pyramidal cells. This is the first extensive inventory of gene expression in the hippocampus and serves as a reference for future studies aimed at elucidating hippocampal transcriptional responses under various conditions.","['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hippocampus/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Neurons/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology']","Bioinformatics, Biology, Gene expression, Genetics, Genomics, Neuroscience, RNA, Transcriptomics, Molecular biology, Neurobiology"

Previous phylogenetic analyses have not consistently resolved the relationships among major hemipteroid lineages. We provide maximum likelihood-based phylogenomic analyses of a taxonomically comprehensive dataset comprising sequences of 2,395 single-copy, protein-coding genes for 193 samples of hemipteroid insects and outgroups. These analyses yield a well-supported phylogeny for hemipteroid insects. Monophyly of each of the three hemipteroid orders (Psocodea, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera) is strongly supported, as are most relationships among suborders and families. Thysanoptera (thrips) is strongly supported as sister to Hemiptera. However, as in a recent large-scale analysis sampling all insect orders, trees from our data matrices support Psocodea (bark lice and parasitic lice) as the sister group to the holometabolous insects (those with complete metamorphosis). In contrast, four-cluster likelihood mapping of these data does not support this result. A molecular dating analysis using 23 fossil calibration points suggests hemipteroid insects began diversifying before the Carboniferous, over 365 million years ago. We also explore implications for understanding the timing of diversification, the evolution of morphological traits, and the evolution of mitochondrial genome organization.

A recent study has indicated that the UFM1-binding and PCI domain-containing protein 1 (UFBP1) is required for the conjugation of UFM1 to a substrate. However, other biological functions of UFBP1 have not been explored. Here, we use immunoprecipitation and label-free quantitative proteomics to identify UFBP1-interacting proteins in a mammalian cell line. About 80 potential interacting proteins are obtained from MS analyses of three biological replicates. Bioinformatics analyses of these proteins suggest that UFBP1 may participate in the regulation of protein folding, stability, and trafficking. Biochemical experiments discover that UFBP1 expression downregulates the protein level and reduces the stability of several of its interacting proteins, while UFBP1 knockdown increases their protein levels. Protein synthesis inhibition and proteasomal inhibition experiments reveal that UFBP1 promotes their ubiquitination and degradation. Experiments using a model UFBP1-interacting protein ANT3 demonstrate that UFBP1 enhances the interaction between ANT3 and its E3 ligase and thus promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. Our work elucidates a novel molecular mechanism by which UFBP1 regulates protein ubiquitination and degradation.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism/*physiology', 'Adenine Nucleotide Translocator 3/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mammals', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Proteolysis', '*Proteomics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', '*Ubiquitination']","['DNA replication and recombination', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein expression', 'Proteins', 'Translational medicine']","['Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology']","Biochemistry, Proteomics, Protein modifications, Protein folding, stability and design, Protein interactions, Proteins, Protein variants, Molecular biology, Cell biology, Gene expression, Gene regulation, DNA replication and recombination"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"The urea channel UT-A1 and the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) mediate vasopressin-regulated transport in the renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). To identify the proteins that interact with UT-A1 and AQP2 in native rat IMCD cells, we carried out chemical cross-linking followed by detergent solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and LC-MS/MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated material. The analyses revealed 133 UT-A1-interacting proteins and 139 AQP2-interacting proteins, each identified in multiple replicates. Fifty-three proteins that were present in both the UT-A1 and the AQP2 interactomes can be considered as mediators of housekeeping interactions, likely common to all plasma membrane proteins. Among proteins unique to the UT-A1 list were those involved in posttranslational modifications: phosphorylation (protein kinases Cdc42bpb, Phkb, Camk2d, and Mtor), ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation (Uba1, Usp9x), and neddylation (Nae1 and Uba3). Among the proteins unique to the AQP2 list were several Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab2a, Rab5b, Rab5c, Rab7a, Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab14, Rab17) involved in membrane trafficking. UT-A1 was found to interact with UT-A3, although quantitative proteomics revealed that most UT-A1 molecules in the cell are not bound to UT-A3. In vitro incubation of UT-A1 peptides with the protein kinases identified in the UT-A1 interactome revealed that all except Mtor were capable of phosphorylating known sites in UT-A1. Overall, the UT-A1 and AQP2 interactomes provide a snapshot of a dynamic process in which UT-A1 and AQP2 are produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, processed through the Golgi apparatus, delivered to endosomes that move into and out of the plasma membrane, and are regulated in the plasma membrane.","['Animals', 'Aquaporin 2/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Computational Biology', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kidney Medulla/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Collecting/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Vasopressin/agonists/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Biosciences', 'Carbon cycle', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Proteins', 'Proteogenomics', 'Proteomics']","['Zoology', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology']","Analytical chemistry, Biochemistry, Biology, Biotechnology, Cell biology, Computational biology, Data integration and warehousing, Genetics, Genomics, Immunology, Laboratory information management, Proteomics, Systems biology"
