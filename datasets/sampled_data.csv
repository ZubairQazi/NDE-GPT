AccessClinicalData@NIAID,Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) - Dataset update released August 2021,"ACTT is a clinical trial platform sponsored by NIAID to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The studies are a multicenter trial and will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The studies will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm.  New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.   The initial iteration of ACTT (ACTT-1) evaluated Remdesivir vs placebo.  Participants had to have a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and meet one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrollment: radiographic infiltrates by imaging study, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).   Remdesivir was administered intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose administered daily on days 2 through 10 or until hospital discharge or death. A matching placebo was administered according to the same schedule and in the same volume as the active drug. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites: United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1).   Participants were assessed daily during their hospitalization, from day 1 through day 29. The participant’s clinical status on an eight-category ordinal scale, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and other clinical data was recorded each day. All serious adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events that represented an increase in severity from day 1 and any grade 2 or higher suspected drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were recorded. Upon discharge, participants had intermittent study visits through Day 29.  The final follow-up for all participants was Day 29."
AccessClinicalData@NIAID,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 2019-nCoV Vaccine (mRNA-1273) for Prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19),"This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic clinical research sites. One hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg). Subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57."

The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.  ACTT-2 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to remdesivir alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized). The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. Each stage may prioritize different secondary endpoints for the purpose of multiple comparison analyses."

AccessClinicalData@NIAID,ACTIV-1 IM - Immune Modulators for Treating COVID-19 - September 2023,"The ACTIV-1 (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) clinical trial enrolled 1971 patients at over 80 sites in the US and Latin America between October 2020 and December 2021.  Subjects were randomized to one of the substudies currently active in the study, and then to either the investigational agent (abatacept, infliximab, cenicriviroc) or its matching placebo. The study analyses compared each active therapy against a pooled placebo population consisting of placebo recipients from all three sub-studies (those accrued during the time the sub-study was actively enrolling). The efficacy of each therapeutic agent as add-on therapy to standard of care was evaluated based on the primary endpoint of time to recovery by Day 29. Key secondary objectives of this study were mortality and clinical improvement. Comparisons of the agents among themselves was not a research objective.  The cenicriviroc (CVC) sub-study was closed to enrollment on September 3, 2021, due to futility.  Evaluations of efficacy also included 8-point Ordinal Scale, incidence, and duration of new oxygen use, and (as an exploratory assessment) National Early Warning Score (NEWS). Safety was evaluated with laboratory and adverse event assessments, as well as evaluations of extrapulmonary manifestations.  Blood was collected at select sites for future secondary research.  Trial participants were assessed daily while hospitalized through Day 29 or discharge. Outpatient follow-up study visits occurred on Days 8, 11, 15 and 29. Follow up assessments by phone occurred at Days 22 and 60 to assess clinical status and adverse events.  The results for this study are available as three separate datasets, one for each sub-study. Enrollment numbers for each sub-study, including the randomization within each sub-study (active vs. matched placebo) and the pooled placebo population for analysis, are as follows:  For Abatacept: Active Drug: 524; Matched Placebo: 214; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 525.  For Infliximab: Active Drug: 531; Matched Placebo: 215; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 530.  For CVC: Active Drug: 360; Matched Placebo: 127; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 363."

AccessClinicalData@NIAID,SDY1760 – Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) - A Prospective Cohort Study to Assess Longitudinal Immune Responses in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 - Dataset Released August 2022,"This was a prospective observational cohort surveillance study of approximately 1100 adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Detailed information was collected regarding patient history and onset of illness upon enrollment. Participants had longitudinal assessments of clinical status, and pertinent clinical data (including clinical laboratory values, radiographic findings, medication use, oxygen and ventilatory support requirements, complications, etc.) was recorded. In parallel, the study conducted serial biologic sampling for detailed immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive picture of immune changes that occurred throughout the course of infection. The biologic samples collected for this observational study included blood, nasal swabs, and endotracheal aspirates. Participants were followed in hospital through Day 28, unless discharged earlier. If a participant required an escalation to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level care, either within or outside of a dedicated ICU, additional samples were collected within 24 and 96 hours of care escalation. Convalescent questionnaires and biologic samples were collected at 3-month intervals up to Month 12 after discharge, if available. In addition, if a participant was discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28, attempts were made to collect additional scheduled assessments through Day 28 on an outpatient basis, if feasible."

WASH Benefits Bangladesh
Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE)



Background: During the first two years of life, children born in low-income countries
      are at risk for enteric infections due to poor water quality, sanitation conditions, and caregiver handwashing
      practices (WASH). During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.
      
      Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence
      also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can
      have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.
      
      The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,
      sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled
      trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope
      (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after
      two years of intervention.     
      
Objectives: The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of
      sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of
      life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized
      trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.
      



The study has three primary scientific objectives:

Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and
        development after 2 years of intervention.
Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing
        intervention compared to each component alone.
Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition
        with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.


The study has three secondary scientific objectives: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)

Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy
        biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development.
Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection
        prevalence and intensity.
Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental
        enteropathy biomarkers.


The tertiary scientific objective of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes: (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)

Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years
Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years
Underweight at 2 years
Wasting at 2 years
Severe stunting at 2 years
Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years
Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years
Protozoan infection at 2 years
Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year
WHO motor milestones at 1 year
Acute respiratory illness
All cause mortality





Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western 
      part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region
      estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households 
      reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs). 
      
Dates of Data Collection: November 2012 - May 2014 
      
Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women 
      were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention. 
      
Eligibility Criteria: The study communities must have met the following criteria:
      

Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops)
Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs
Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities
At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline



Study Arms: Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior 
      to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional 
      interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.
      

 Water quality: The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants. 
        All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the 
        source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield 
        2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households 
        in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they 
        rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were 
        visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

Sanitation: The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were 
        upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with
        a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households 
        in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of
        the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent
        contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Handwashing: The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households. 
        The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included
        a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families 
        free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times: 
        after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH): Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation, 
        and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Nutrition: Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached
        6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about
        supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from
        Unicef and
        WHO.
        From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested
        through the iLiNS project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months) 
        living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN): Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation, 
        handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Double-sized active control arm: Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.

 Passive control arm: Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.


Units of Data Collection: Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as 
      long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds 
      were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for 
      enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to 
      that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ. 
      Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were 
      considered ""target"" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were 
      considered ""sibling/neighbor"" children. 
      
Data Collection: A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal 
      age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors 
      (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the 
      interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline). 
      Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.

VIDA Case Control Study
VIDA HUCS Kenya



Background: Despite considerable progress in reducing diarrhea-related mortality over the past two decades, diarrheal diseases remain the second leading cause of post-neonatal death during the first 5 years of life in developing countries. During the next few years, rotavirus vaccines are expected to be introduced into routine infant immunization programs across low-income countries, and marked reductions in child deaths and hospitalizations from rotavirus diarrhea are anticipated. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Case Control study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a full course of rotavirus vaccine using a case control design, and to assess the impact of rotavirus introduction on the etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD).
      
      At each VIDA Case Control site, participants were recruited from a censused population with an ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) which conducts rounds at least twice per year to enumerate and characterize the population in order to measure disease incidence. A Health care utilization and coverage survey (HUCS) was conducted semi-annually for 36 months as part of the DSS at each site with the data linked to the VIDA study.
      
Objectives:

To determine the proportion of children who do not seek care at sentinel health centers (SHCs) when they have MSD, which can be used to calculate population-based disease incidence estimates derived from children seeking care at the SHCs and adjusted for children who do not seek care at the SHCs for MSD
To allow us to determine where children from the DSS population seek care when they have MSD, to guide the choice of SHCs for case enrollment during the case-control study
To assess rotavirus vaccine coverage
To determine whether vaccinated and unvaccinated children differ with regard to their propensity to seek care at a SHC for MSD


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: This study was conducted in two sites in sub-Saharan Africa- Bamako, Mali and Basse, The Gambia, where rotavirus was found to be the most important pathogen during the first 2 years of life in the GEMS study. Mali and The Gambia recently introduced the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.
      
Dates of Data Collection: 2015- 2018
      
Study Design: Observational cross-sectional study
      
Sampling: At least twice a year, from the continually updated DSS database at each study site, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of approximately 550 eligible children were selected from the 0-11 month age group (over-sampled because of the potential difficulties locating children in this age group), and 500 eligible children from each of the two older age strata were selected (12-23 months and 24-59 months) using the updated census list. 
      
Eligibility Criteria: The participants must have met the following inclusion criteria-

Age 0-59 months
Belongs to the DSS
Randomly selected from the DSS database

Data Collection: The primary caretakers of participants were asked additional questions during the routine DSS interview.
      
Information was solicited about the household and family composition, household possessions (to calculate a wealth index as a proxy for socioeconomic status), occurrences and nature of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.
The parent/primary caretaker of each selected child was asked whether the child had diarrhea in the previous 7 days. If so, they were asked a brief panel of ~30 questions such as: i) whether the child had: sunken eyes (more than usual), wrinkled skin, IV hydration, dysentery, or was hospitalized; ii) whether they took the child for care outside of the home, and if so where.
An important component of the HUCS was the determination of the child's vaccine coverage.  The child's vaccination card was examined and the dates that the child received vaccines against rotavirus, oral polio, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus containing vaccine, and the EPI center attended were recorded.

Last Updated: October 10, 2022During the course of the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study, a Health care Utilization and Coverage Survey (HUCS) was conducted semiannually as part of the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) at each VIDA study site. In The Gambia and Mali, a random selection of children from three age strata was selected and the HUCS was conducted by the DSS team during their routine rounds. The goal of the survey was to assess rotavirus vaccine coverage and to determine where children in the DSS seek care for moderate-to-severe diarrhea."
ClinEpiDB,Preventing Congenital Syphilis Cluster Randomized Trial,"Background: Maternal syphilis is associated with stillbirths, perinatal deaths, prematurity, and congenital infections and remains a major global concern, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2012, among women who were estimated to be likely to have active syphilis, only 3% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 24% in Zambia were treated. In contrast, the WHO recommends that coverage of syphilis testing and treatment of positive cases among pregnant women should each be at least 95% in order to eliminate mother-to-child transmission.
      
      While there is evidence that insufficient access to supplies hinders screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy in low-resource settings, additional interventions might be needed to overcome barriers related to health providers' behaviors regarding treatment and increase the likelihood that the supplies are used. This study assessed whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention based on previous research experience combined with the provision of supplies was more effective than providing supplies only to improve syphilis screening and treatment in seropositive pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Lusaka (Zambia).
      
Objectives: The primary objectives of the study were to determine if behavioral interventions 1) improved the likelihood that women were screened for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit, and 2) for those who screened positive, whether they were more likely to receive syphilis treatment at their first antenatal care visit. Secondary objectives included assessing:
      
The frequency with which women received screening for HIV at their first antenatal care visit
The frequency with which women received screening for anemia at their first antenatal care visit
The frequency with which women received screening for proteinuria at their first antenatal care visit


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: 16 antenatal care clinics in the Maluku and Nsele health areas, located in the capital city-province of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were included in baseline data collection. 10 of those antenatal care clinics were included in the intervention phase. 10 clinics in health areas located within the capital province of Lusaka, Zambia were included in baseline data collection and the intervention phase.
        
Dates of Data Collection: Baseline data collection was conducted from April 1, 2015 to January 13, 2016 in the DRC and from April 13, 2015 to January 10, 2016 in Zambia. The intervention phase was conducted from February 1, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in the DRC and from February 8, 2016 to July 14, 2017 in Zambia.
        
Study Design: Cluster randomized trial
        
Eligibility Criteria: All pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at the participating clinics who consented to participate were eligible to be enrolled, irrespective of their gestational age. Antenatal care was defined as care during pregnancy before the initiation of labor. A first antenatal care visit was defined as the first visit in the participating facility during the current pregnancy.
        
Study Arms: All clinics received supplies for screening and treating syphilis, including rapid tests, benzathine penicillin, and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment, as well as training on using rapid tests. The intervention arm additionally received a multifaceted strategy consisting of: 
        
Identification and training of opinion leaders among prenatal health providers, who disseminated, implemented, and maintained the best evidence practices using reminders, monitoring, and feedback. The goal was that facilitators learn: 1) priority health conditions to be screened and treated during pregnancy; 2) how to screen and manage maternal syphilis; and 3) how to effectively implement the congenital syphilis prevention program at the clinics in order to ensure all eligible women are screened and treated and that standard partner management is done.
Packaging the supplies in kits: Point-of-care rapid test kits for syphilis diagnosis with instructions for immediate treatment, if positive; Treatment kits (benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, syringe and needle, instructions, and information on side-effects); Anaphylaxis treatment kits for emergency use if needed (resources to treat an anaphylaxis adverse reaction according to local practice guidelines).
Information on monitoring the availability of rapid tests and ensuring the availability of benzathine penicillin and anaphylaxis adverse reaction treatment.


        Prenatal health providers at control clinics were invited to participate in a half-day training workshop where they were given refresher concepts on the prenatal care package and maternal and congenital syphilis and were trained in syphilis case detection and management, using standard and available screening methods. 
        
Randomization: Baseline data was used in a covariate-adjusted randomization procedure (Ivers et al., 2012) to balance the intervention and control groups in regards to: (1) Number of first antenatal care visits; (2) Number of women screened for syphilis; (3) Number of women with a positive test for syphilis; (4) Number of first antenatal care visits per provider; (5) Percentage of women screened for syphilis; (6) Percentage of women positive for syphilis; (7) Country; (8) Type of Clinic. 
        
Data Collection: Data regarding the participant's obstetric and syphilis history as well as testing for syphilis, HIV, proteinuria, and anemia were collected at a participant's first antenatal care visit for their current pregnancy. Data were obtained from source documents such as antenatal care log books, antenatal cards, prevention of mother-to-child transmission books, laboratory log books, and nursing log books. Data not available in source documents were collected by interviewing the women. Participants with a positive test for syphilis who did not receive treatment during the first visit were followed up by study personnel until their estimated date of delivery to ensure that all infected women received treatment before delivery. Participants were contacted at the subsequent antenatal care visits or by phone. The list of seropositive women who did not receive treatment at the first visit was communicated monthly to the country principal investigators to be shared with local health authorities.

ClinEpiDB,GEMS1A HUAS Lite Survey,"Related studies:


GEMS1A Case Control
GEMS1 HUAS/HUAS Lite Survey
GEMS1 Case Control



Background: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1A HUAS Lite surveys was a community-based Healthcare Services Utilization and Attitudes Survey (HUAS) conducted in conjunction with the GEMS1A Case Control study. The survey is a shortened version of the original GEMS1 HUAS survey and provides data on where parents seek care when their children have diarrheal disease, and their attitudes and practices concerning diarrhea, its prevention and treatment.
      
Objectives: Data from the GEMS1 1A HUAS Lite surveys was used in different ways,
      
To optimize the surveillance for determining disease burden
To perform data adjustments to account for the proportion of children with diarrhea who do not seek care at the health care facilities participating in GEMS surveillance
To calculate population-based incidence rates
To compare data between the different sites
To assess public perception of the need for interventions to prevent childhood diarrhea


Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites:Seven GEMS sites with moderate-to-high under-five child mortality participated in GEMS1A HUAS Lite, four in Africa (Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Basse, The Gambia; and Nyanza Province, Kenya) and three in Asia (Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Bin Qasim Town, Karachi, Pakistan).
      


Dates of Data Collection: December 2010- August 2011; Per protocol, each GEMS1A site conducted surveys of health care services utilization and attitudes twice a year over the course of the study.
      
Study Design: Community-based Cross-sectional Survey
      
Eligibility Criteria: Many of the HUAS Lite methods are adapted from the Generic protocol for a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age.(World Health Organization. Generic protocols for: i) hospital-based surveillance to estimate the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children and ii) a community-based survey on utilization of health care services for gastroenteritis in children. Geneva: WHO; 2002.) 
      
      However, since the catchment population at each site will have had a recent census and ongoing demographic surveillance, it was possible to randomly select children 0-59 months of age to participate in the HUAS Lite. From the census at each study site, updated by the ongoing surveillance, computerized lists of children were constructed for each of the age groups of interest (0-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months). The census database thus should have been as current as possible, in order to include recent births and to put children who have crossed an age group boundary in the appropriate group. The list defines the population from which the HUAS sample is drawn.
      
Data Collection: The interviewer went to the child's home and described the study to the selected child's parent or primary caretaker. If the parent or primary caretaker wished to participate, the consent form was read aloud by the interviewer in the local language and the parent/primary caretaker was given an opportunity to ask questions. Thereafter, s/he would either provide a signature or (if s/he did not know how to write) place a mark on the consent form (this could be an ""x"" or a fingerprint) in the presence of a witness (who would also sign the form) indicating his/her willingness to participate. The parent or primary caretaker received a copy of the signed consent form to keep and the original was stored in the regulatory files at the study site. The respondent was the child's primary caretaker. If a primary caretaker was not available, this was recorded and the interviewer tried to leave a message indicating when the interviewer would be likely to return. A total of 3 attempts were made to contact a primary caretaker after which time the child was considered a nonresponder.
      
      A new HUAS Lite questionnaire was to be used for each child contacted. The data collected from the ~20 questions asked include information about the household and family composition, occurrence of recent diarrheal illnesses among children younger than 5 years, and health care utilization practices.

ClinEpiDB,Namibia rfMDA RAVC Cluster Randomized Trial - EDA data for QA,"Background: In low-endemic malaria settings, screening and
      treatment near malaria index cases (reactive case detection, RACD) is practiced for surveillance and response. However, since the effectiveness of RACD is limited by the low sensitivity of point-of-care tests to detect low-density chronic infections that perpetuate malaria transmission, other approaches may be more effective. 
      
Objectives: This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in a low endemic setting to evaluate the impact of two reactive focal malaria interventions - reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC). The objectives were to:
      


Evaluate the effectiveness of rfMDA, RAVC, and their combination to decrease malaria
       transmission
Evaluate the safety of rfMDA and RAVC, alone and in combination



Methodology:

Geographic Location/Study Sites: Zambezi Region, Namibia
      
Dates of Data Collection: January 2017-December 2017
      
Study Design: Cluster-randomized controlled open label two-by-two
      factorial design trial
      
Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study intervention are shown below:
      


Study Arms: Fifty-six census enumeration area (EA) clusters were randomized to: 1) RACD or rfMDA, and 2) RAVC or no RAVC.
      


RACD: rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine
       (AL)
rfMDA: presumptive treatment with AL
RAVC: indoor residual spraying using pirimiphos-methyl



Data Collection: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA versus RACD), in mosquitos (RAVC versus no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC versus RACD only) on the primary outcome of cluster-level cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases, an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
      
      Interventions were administered to the target population within 500 meters of an index case, as randomized. Index cases were defined as passively detected malaria cases that were confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or microscopy, irrespective of origin (e.g. local or imported), who were confirmed to reside in or have stayed at least one night in study EA in the previous four weeks. Data on malaria incidence and epidemiological data such as demographics, residence location, travel history, and malaria prevention behavior were collected. 
      
      Field teams aimed to visit the index case household and eligible neighboring households within seven days but up to five weeks from the report of an index case, prioritizing households that were closest to the index case. To cover ≥80% of individuals or households within 500 meters of index cases, field teams aimed to deliver RACD or rfMDA to at least 25 individuals and RAVC (if indicated) to at least 7 households. 
      
      Epidemiological data were collected on password secured tablets with pre-coded questionnaires programmed in Open Data Kit (ODK version 1.23.3). Tablet data was uploaded to a secure, firewall- and password-protected server. During the RACD intervention and during the endline cross-sectional survey, consenting individuals received malaria RDT testing and a dried blood spot (DBS) was collected for laboratory testing.

","An important problem in evolution is identifying the genetic basis of how different species adapt to similar environments. Understanding how diverse bacterial pathogens evolve in response to an antimicrobial treatment is a pressing example of this problem, where discovery of molecular parallelism could lead to clinically useful predictions. Evolution experiments with pathogens in environments containing antibiotics, combined with periodic whole population genome sequencing, can be used to identify many contending routes to antimicrobial resistance. We separately propagated two clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, in increasing concentrations of tobramycin in two different environments each: planktonic and biofilm. Independent of the pathogen, populations adapted to tobramycin selection by parallel evolution of mutations in fusA1, encoding elongation factor G, and ptsP, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase. As neither gene is a direct target of this aminoglycoside, both are unexpected and underreported causes of resistance. Additionally, both species acquired antibiotic-associated mutations that were more prevalent in the biofilm lifestyle than planktonic, in electron transport chain components in A. baumannii and LPS biosynthesis enzymes in P. aeruginosa populations. Using existing databases, we discovered both fusA1 and ptsP mutations to be prevalent in antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. Additionally, we report site-specific parallelism of fusA1 mutations that extend across several bacterial phyla. This study suggests that strong selective pressures such as antibiotic treatment may result in high levels of predictability in molecular targets of evolution despite differences between organism's genetic background and environment."

Dryad Digital Repository,Tadpole begging reveals high quality,"Parents can benefit from allocating limited resources non-randomly among offspring, and offspring solicitation (i.e., begging) is often hypothesized to evolve because it contains information valuable to choosy parents. We tested the diagnostic predictions of three ‘honest begging’ hypotheses –Signal of Need, Signal of Quality, and Signal of Hunger – in the tadpoles of a terrestrial frog (Oophaga pumilio). In this frog, mothers provision tadpoles with trophic eggs, and when mothers visit, tadpoles perform a putative begging signal by stiffening their bodies and vibrating rapidly. We assessed the information content of intense tadpole begging with an experimental manipulation of tadpole condition (need/quality) and food-deprivation (hunger). This experiment revealed patterns consistent with the Signal of Quality hypothesis and directly counter to predictions of Signal of Need and Signal of Hunger. Begging effort and performance were higher in more developed and higher condition tadpoles and declined with food-deprivation. Free-living mothers were unlikely to feed tadpoles of a non-begging species experimentally cross-fostered with their own, and allocated larger meals to more developed tadpoles and those that vibrated at higher speed. Mother O. pumilio favour their high quality young, and because their concurrent offspring are reared in separate nurseries, must do so by making active allocation decisions. Our results suggest that these maternal choices are based at least in part on offspring signals, indicating that offspring solicitation can evolve to signal high quality."
Dryad Digital Repository,Differential effects of soil chemistry on the foliar resorption of nitrogen and phosphorus across altitudinal gradients,"1.Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves prior to litterfall is a strategy for nutrient conservation in vascular plants. However, the mechanisms through which soil fertility and/or foliar nutrient status affect nutrient resorption are not yet fully known.

2.We used two 1000 m‐wide altitudinal gradients on two different bedrock types (carbonate and silicate) for analysing the interactive effects of temperature and soil chemistry on the resorption efficiency of two major nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our objective was to assess how nutrient resorption varied across the gradients through the adaptation of individual species to changing environmental conditions rather than through changes in species composition.

3.Both N and P resorption efficiency increased across the altitudinal gradients independent of bedrock type. The main process regulating nutrient resorption was a negative feedback to nutrient availability in the soil. The negative feedback of nutrient resorption efficiency to soil nutrient status was unrelated to total soil nutrient contents but depended on concentrations of organic N forms for nitrogen resorption efficiency (NRE) and on inorganic P forms for phosphorus resorption efficiency (PRE), respectively.

4.While we hypothesized that the resorption of P, as a principally rock‐derived nutrient, depended on physical‐chemical processes affected by soil chemistry, our results showed that microbial P mineralization was the main source of inorganic P supply to the plants. Both NRE and PRE were effective to improve the growth potential of plants but there was no evidence of stoichiometric adaptations of N:P RE to nutrient ratio in the soil."
Dryad Digital Repository,"Concessions, lifetime fitness consequences and the evolution of coalitionary behavior","The relationship between the costs of coalitionary behavior and the evolution of such behavior has not been closely examined by theoretical studies. Here, we create a set of life-history models for species whose coalitionary behavior is genetically determined to investigate how different types of costs afflicted upon members of failed coalitions, in terms of survival, fecundity, and social rank, may influence the nature of coalitionary behavior that emerges at evolutionary equilibrium. We also extend previous theory by examining the coevolution between coalitionary behavior and concessions granted by dominant individuals to prevent dominants from being targeted by coalitions. We show that species that form coalitions to contest social rank evolve to regularly form bridging coalitions under a vast majority of social and ecological settings, whereas species that contest fecundity form all-up coalitions under most conditions. Further, dominant individuals concede resources to subordinates to prevent coalitionary attacks only in very few circumstances, and these concessions occur only to ensure another individual is a more attractive coalition target. We compare and contrast results to empirical data to provide an evolutionary context for commonly observed coalitionary behaviors in the animal kingdom."
Dryad Digital Repository,Women’s preference for masculine traits is disrupted by images of male-on-female aggression,"Women’s preferences for men’s masculinized faces and voices were assessed after women (n = 331) were primed with images of male-on-male aggression, male-on-female aggression, pathogens, and neutral scenes. Male-on-male aggression and pathogen primes were associated with increased preference for masculine traits, but the same effect emerged in the neutral condition. We show the increased preference for masculine traits was due to repeated exposure to these traits, not the priming images themselves. Images of male-on-female aggression were an exception; these elicited feelings of disgust and anger appeared to disrupt the preference for masculinized traits. The results suggest women process men’s facial and vocal traits as signals of aggressive potential and lose any preference for these traits with cues indicating men might direct this aggression toward them.

Dryad Digital Repository,Population size and major valleys explain microsatellite variation better than taxonomic units for caribou in western Canada,"Identifying conservation units below the species level is becoming increasingly important, particularly when limited resources necessitate prioritization for conservation among such units. This problem is exemplified with caribou, a mammal with a circum-Arctic distribution that is exposed to a broad spectrum of ecological conditions, but is also declining in many parts of its range. We used microsatellite markers to evaluate the suitability of existing intra-specific taxonomic designations to act as population units for conservation, and contrasted this with landscape features that were independent of taxonomy. We also quantified the relationship between genetic differentiation and subpopulation size, a factor that has been under-represented in landscape genetic research. Our dataset included three subspecies and three ecotypes of caribou that varied in population size by five orders of magnitude. Our results indicated that genetic structure did not correspond to existing taxonomic designation, particularly at the level of ecotype. Instead, we found that major valleys and population size were the strongest factors associated with substructure. There was a negative exponential relationship between population size and FST between pairs of adjacent subpopulations, suggesting that genetic drift was the mechanism causing the structure among the smallest subpopulations. A genetic assignment test revealed that movement among subpopulations was a fraction of the level needed to stabilize smaller subpopulations, indicating little chance for demographic rescue. Such results may be broadly applicable to landscape genetic studies, because population size and corresponding rates of drift have the potential to confound interpretations of landscape effects on population structure."
Dryad Digital Repository,"Contrasting genetic diversity and population structure among three sympatric Madagascan shorebirds: parallels with rarity, endemism, and dispersal","Understanding the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to population structure and genetic diversity is a central goal of conservation and evolutionary genetics. One way to achieve this is through comparative population genetic analysis of sympatric sister taxa, which allows evaluation of intrinsic factors such as population demography and life history while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and geography. We used ten conserved microsatellites to explore the population structure and genetic diversity of three sympatric and closely related plover species in southwestern Madagascar: Kittlitz's plover (Charadrius pecuarius), white-fronted plover (C. marginatus), and Madagascar plover (C. thoracicus). Bayesian clustering revealed strong population structure in the rare and endemic Madagascar plover, intermediate population structure in the white-fronted plover, and no detectable population structure in the geographically widespread Kittlitz's plover. In contrast, allelic richness and heterozygosity were highest for the Kittlitz's plover, intermediate for the white-fronted plover and lowest for the Madagascar plover. No evidence was found in support of the “watershed mechanism” proposed to facilitate vicariant divergence of Madagascan lemurs and reptiles, which we attribute to the vagility of birds. However, we found a significant pattern of genetic isolation by distance among populations of the Madagascar plover, but not for the other two species. These findings suggest that interspecific variation in rarity, endemism, and dispersal propensity may influence genetic structure and diversity, even in highly vagile species."

Dryad Digital Repository,The EDA receptor (EDAR) is a candidate gene for lateral plate number variation in stickleback fish,"Variation in lateral plating in stickleback fish represents a classical example of rapid and parallel adaptation in morphology. The underlying genetic architecture involves polymorphism at the ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene. However, lateral plate number is influenced by additional loci that remain poorly characterized. Here we search for such loci by performing genome-wide differentiation mapping based on pooled whole-genome sequence data from a European stickleback population variable in the extent of lateral plating, while tightly controlling for the phenotypic effect of EDA. This suggests a new candidate locus, the EDA receptor (EDAR) gene, for which additional support is obtained by individual-level targeted Sanger sequencing and by comparing allele frequencies among natural populations. Overall, our study illustrates the power of pooled whole-genome sequencing for searching phenotypically relevant loci and opens opportunities for exploring the population genetics and ecological significance of a new candidate locus for stickleback armor evolution.
Methods
These data were generated to investigate candidate genes for the reduction in the lateral plates of stickleback fish (Gasterosteus acculeatus). These consist mainly of pool whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Individuals were pooled, by plating phenotype, controlling for EDA genotype and lateral plate phenotype, and all raw whole-genome read data has been deposited in the NCBI SRA library (see file SRA_Accession_Info.xlsx for specif codes). Phenotypic data to access lateral plate number for the focus population (a stream from Constance Lake) is also provided. See methods section in DOI: 10.1093/g3journal/jkac077 for further details."
Dryad Digital Repository,Identifying homomorphic sex chromosomes from wild-caught adults with limited genomic resources,"We demonstrate a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to identify homomorphic sex chromosomes and their homolog in a distantly related reference genome, based on noninvasive sampling of wild-caught individuals, in the moor frog Rana arvalis. Double-digest RADseq libraries were generated using buccal swabs from 30 males and 21 females from the same population. Search for sex-limited markers from the unfiltered data set (411 446 RAD tags) was more successful than searches from a filtered data set (33 073 RAD tags) for markers showing sex differences in heterozygosity or in allele frequencies. Altogether, we obtained 292 putatively sex-linked RAD loci, 98% of which point to male heterogamety. We could map 15 of them to the Xenopus tropicalis genome, all but one on chromosome pair 1, which seems regularly co-opted for sex determination among amphibians. The most efficient mapping strategy was a three-step hierarchical approach, where R. arvalis reads were first mapped to a low-coverage genome of Rana temporaria (17 My divergence), then the R. temporaria scaffolds to the Nanorana parkeri genome (90 My divergence), and finally the N. parkeri scaffolds to the X. tropicalis genome (210 My). We validated our conclusions with PCR primers amplifying part of Dmrt1, a candidate sex determination gene mapping to chromosome 1: a sex-diagnostic allele was present in all 30 males but in none of the 21 females. Our approach is likely to be productive in many situations where biological samples and/or genomic resources are limited."
Dryad Digital Repository,Experimental study of high-flow and low-expansion backfill material,"High-flow low-expansion backfill materials have been developed to improve difficult slurry pipeline transport and the poor roof-contact effect of many filling materials. The fly ash content was fixed at 80%, and the content of mineral powder was 8.5% - 9.5%, lime was 8.5% - 9.5%, and desulfurized gypsum was 2% - 3%, with a sodium carbonate content of 0.9% - 1.2% and an aluminum powder content of 0.01% - 0.02%. The prepared backfill material processed good fluidity, and the expansion rate of the hardened material reached 2% - 3%, and the compressive strength at 90 d reached 4 MPa - 5.5 MPa. SEM observations indicated that as the aluminum content increased, the ettringite on bubble walls transformed from a fine-needle to a needle-rod shape. Secondly, the hydration products of the system were mainly hydrated calcium silicate gel and ettringite, which interconnected and promoted the formation of the structure. The backfill material had extensive sources of raw materials, low cost, and a simple filling process and good filling effect."
Dryad Digital Repository,The influence of landscape context on short- and long-term forest change following a severe ice storm,"1. When deforestation results in small forest fragments surrounded by a non-forest matrix, forest stands within these fragments experience changes in structure and community composition. They also continue to experience natural disturbances like hurricanes and ice storms. It is unclear whether the landscape context of forest stands influences plant community response to natural disturbances. 2. Using data from surveys of forested plots in the years immediately following and 19 years after a severe ice storm, we measured changes in woody stem density, species richness, and beta diversity. 3. Plots with greater storm damage had greater gains in stems and species, and greater shifts in community composition. In addition, there were interactions between the degree of storm damage and landscape context. The short-term effects of storm damage were magnified in plots with less forest on the surrounding landscape and farther from the forest edge.  In plots with high damage, a return towards pre-storm conditions over the long-term occurred more often in plots farther from the forest edge compared to those close to the edge. 4. Synthesis: Future climate scenarios predict increases in severe weather and accompanying ecosystem disturbance. Our results show that it is important to consider landscape context when assessing the response of forest communities to such disturbances."
Dryad Digital Repository,Co-expression networks in Chlamydomonas reveal significant rhythmicity in batch cultures and empower gene function discovery,"The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a choice reference system for the study of photosynthesis and chloroplast metabolism, cilium assembly and function, lipid and starch metabolism, and metal homeostasis. Despite decades of research, the functions of thousands of genes remain largely unknown, and new approaches are needed to categorically assign genes to cellular pathways. Growing collections of transcriptome and proteome data now allow a systematic approach based on integrative co-expression analysis. We used a dataset comprising 518 deep transcriptome samples derived from 58 independent experiments to identify potential co-expression relationships between genes. We visualized co-expression potential with the R package corrplot, to easily assess co-expression and anti-correlation between genes. We extracted several hundred high-confidence genes at the intersection of multiple curated lists involved in cilia, cell division, and photosynthesis, illustrating the power of our method. Surprisingly, Chlamydomonas experiments retained a significant rhythmic component across the transcriptome, suggesting an underappreciated variable during sample collection, even in samples collected in constant light. Our results therefore document substantial residual synchronization in batch cultures, contrary to assumptions of asynchrony. We provide step-by-step protocols for the analysis of co-expression across transcriptome data sets from Chlamydomonas and other species to help foster gene function discovery

Methods
For Chlamydomonas, the data set consists of 518 RNA-seq samples derived from 58 independent experiments, most published.
For Arabidospis, the data sets were downloaded from the AtGenExpress project site (http://jsp.weigelworld.org/AtGenExpress/resources/), and collated into a single file that consisted of 34 Arabidopsis accessions, 16 sets of etiolated seedlings exposed to various light treatments, 36 sets of seedlings exposed to pathogens, 13 cell culture samples, 68 sets each for shoots and roots exposed to various abiotic stresses, 79 developmental samples (72 from shoots or leaves, 7 from roots), and 18 sets each for leaves and roots subjected to iron deficiency, with controls included.

Dryad Digital Repository,"A quantitative taxonomic review of Fusichonetes and Tethyochonetes (Chonetidina, Brachiopoda)","Two middle Permian (Capitanian) to Early Triassic (Griesbachian) rugosochonetidae brachiopod genera, Fusichonetes Liao in Zhao et al., 1981 and Tethyochonetes Chen et al., 2000, have been regarded as two distinct taxa and used as such for a wide range of discussions including biostratigraphy, paleoecology, paleobiogeography, and the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction. However, the supposed morphological distinctions between the two taxa are subtle at best and appear to represent two end members of a continuum of morphological variations. In this study, we applied a range of quantitative and analytical procedures (bivariate plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, categorical principle component analysis, and cladistic analysis) to a dataset of 15 quantified morphological variables, integrating both key external and internal characters, measured from 141 specimens of all well-known Fusichonetes and Tethyochonetes in order to test whether or not these two genera could be distinguished in view of the chosen characters. The results indicate that these two genera are morphologically indistinguishable and that the species classification previously applied to these two genera appears to represent polyphyletic groupings within the genus Fusichonetes. Consequently, Tethyochonetes is concluded to be a junior synonym of Fusichonetes. The diagnosis and key characteristics of Fusichonetes are clarified and refined based on a new suite of well-preserved specimens from the Permian−Triassic Xinmin section in South China."
Dryad Digital Repository,"Divergence in plumage, voice, and morphology indicates speciation in Rufous-capped Warblers (Basileuterus rufifrons)","The biodiversity of the Neotropics is considerable, but it is likely underestimated owing to gaps in sampling effort and a focus on using morphological features of animals to determine species differences rather than divergence in their mating signals and behavior. Recent multi-trait analyses incorporating morphological, plumage, and vocal data have allowed for more accurate quantification of tropical biodiversity. We present a comprehensive study of morphological features, plumage, and vocalizations of the Neotropical resident Rufous-capped Warbler (Basileuterus rufifrons). This species’ taxonomic status is controversial because the B. r. salvini subspecies is intermediate in plumage coloration between the neighboring B. r. delattrii and B. r. rufifrons subspecies. Using morphological and spectral plumage measurements of field and museum specimens, as well as analyses of vocalizations from field recordings and sound libraries, we compared phenotypes of all eight currently recognized Rufous-capped Warbler subspecies, with an emphasis on delattrii, rufifrons, and salvini. We found that delattrii and rufifrons differ significantly in morphology and plumage, and that salvini is similar to rufifrons in morphology and some plumage features. Vocalizations fall into two distinct groups, delattrii and rufifrons-salvini, which differ in multiple spectro-temporal characteristics with no overlap between them, even among individuals in the delattrii-rufifrons zone of sympatry. Our results therefore suggest that Rufous-capped Warblers comprise two distinct groups: Rufous-capped Warblers (B. r. rufifrons and salvini as well as B. r. caudatus, dugesi, and jouyi) and Chestnut-capped Warblers (B. r. delattrii as well as B. r. actuosus and mesochrysus). Future genomic analysis of samples from multiple sites in Mexico and Central America will further refine our assessment of range-wide phenotypic and genetic divergence in this species complex.

Methods
Morphology data: Wing, tail, tarsus, and bill measurements were collected from museum specimens and live birds caught in the field.
Plumage coloration data: Spectrometry measurements were collected from 10 body regions for each museum specimen included in the analysis.
Song data: Recordings of singing birds were obtained in the field, and from the Macaulay and University of Florida natural sound archives. The audio files were high-pass filtered and spot-filtered to remove non-target background sounds. The associated audio files included are minimally processed versions (unprocessed or high-pass filtered only).

Dryad Digital Repository,Three-dimensional shape and velocity changes affect responses of a locust visual interneuron to approaching objects,"Adaptive collision avoidance behaviours require accurate detection of complex spatiotemporal properties of an object approaching in an animal's natural, 3-dimensional environment. Within the locust, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic partner, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) respond robustly to images that emulate an approaching 2-dimensional object and exhibit firing rate modulation correlated with changes in object trajectory. It is not known how this pathway responds to visual expansion of a 3-dimensional object or an approaching object that changes velocity, both of which representing natural stimuli. We compared DCMD responses to images that emulate the approach of a sphere with those elicited by a 2-dimensional disc. A sphere evoked later peak firing and deceased sensitivity to the ratio of the half size of the object to the approach velocity, resulting in an increased threshold subtense angle required to generate peak firing. We also presented locusts with a sphere that decreased or increased velocity against either a white or flow field background. A velocity decrease resulted in transition-associated peak firing followed by a firing rate increase that resembled the response to a constant, slower velocity. A velocity increase resulted in an earlier increase in the firing rate that was more pronounced with an earlier transition. For the flow field contrast used here, we observed no effect of background motion on responses to approaches along constant or changing velocities. These results further demonstrate that this pathway can provide motor circuits for behaviour with salient information about complex stimulus dynamics."
Dryad Digital Repository,Pregnancy is detected via odour in a wild cooperative breeder,"Among mammals, scent has long been known to encode oestrus; however, in many species, detecting pregnancy may also be important in terms of both competition and mate-choice. Here, we show, through odour presentation experiments, that pregnancy is discernible via scent by both sexes in the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. Males spent more time investigating and were more likely to scent mark the odours of non-pregnant females, compared to pregnant females. Females showed increased levels of scent marking when odours were of the same reproductive state as themselves. These results present the first direct demonstration that pregnancy is detectable via scent in wild cooperative breeders. Detecting pregnancy may be particularly important in cooperative breeders as, in addition to the competition between males for receptive mates, there is also intense competition between females for access to alloparental care. Consequently, dominant females benefit from targeting reproductive suppression towards subordinates that represent direct threats, such as pregnant females."
Dryad Digital Repository,Suffering in receivers: negative effects of noise persist regardless of experience in female anurans,"1. Anthropogenic noise is widespread, and growing evidence suggests that it can negatively affect animals through many different mechanisms including masking of cues and signals, distraction, and aversion to noise. 2. Acoustic masking has received the most attention from researchers and recent evidence suggests that masking effects can be mitigated by alteration of signal frequencies or amplitudes by signalers. Additionally, alteration can be a learned response via prior experience with noise exposure. However, it remains unclear whether distraction or aversive effects due to noise can be mitigated by prior experience with noise, especially among signal receivers. 3. Here, we addressed this gap by separating mechanisms of noise disturbances on female phonotaxis towards male advertisement calls in anurans. To do this, we experimentally examined phonotaxis of gravid females that differ in their prior experience with noise under three acoustic manipulations: spectrally overlapping and non-overlapping noise that either mask or do not mask male advertisement calls respectively, plus a silent control. 4. We confirm two experience-dependent responses of noisy-site individuals relative to quiet-site individuals: faster initiation of phonotaxis under non-overlapping noise and a stronger aversive response against overlapping noise. However, we showed that, for both noisy- versus quiet-site individuals, both overlapping and non-overlapping noise treatments resulted in delayed initiation and disorientation of phonotaxis relative to silent control treatments. 5. Our study provides the first evidence to demonstrate that, although prior experience appears to mitigate the negative effects of distraction or aversion to noise, prior experience falls short of fully compensating for disrupted orientation through phonotaxis. Additionally, although most studies have emphasized masking of biologically relevant cues and signals as the most prominent mechanism by which noise negatively affects wild organisms, we show that non-overlapping noise, which cannot cause signal and cue masking, can have negative consequences via distraction or aversive responses. This finding suggests that noise impacts could extend well beyond contexts involving acoustic cue detection and discrimination and deserves increased attention by researchers."
Dryad Digital Repository,Paternal but not maternal age influences early-life performance of offspring in a long-lived seabird,"Variability in demographic traits between individuals within populations has profound implications for both evolutionary processes and population dynamics. Parental effects as a source of non-genetic inheritance are important processes to consider to understand the causes of individual variation. In iteroparous species, parental age is known to influence strongly reproductive success and offspring quality, but consequences on offspring fitness component after independence are much less studied. Based on a 37 years longitudinal monitoring of a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross, we investigate delayed effects of parental age on offspring fitness components. We provide evidence that parental age influences offspring performance beyond the age of independence. By distinguishing maternal and paternal age effects, we demonstrate that paternal age, but not maternal age, impacts negatively post-fledging offspring performance."
Dryad Digital Repository,Fungicide suppression of flight performance in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and its amelioration by quercetin,"As a managed agricultural pollinator, the western honey bee Apis mellifera frequently encounters agrochemicals as contaminants of nectar and pollen. One such contaminant, the fungicide boscalid, is applied at bloom in orchards for fungal floral pathogen control. As an inhibitor of complex II in the mitochondrial electron transport chain of fungi, boscalid can potentially interfere with high energy-demanding activities of bees, including flight. We designed an indoor flight treadmill to evaluate impacts of ingesting boscalid and/or quercetin, a ubiquitous phytochemical in bee food that also affects mitochondrial respiration. Boscalid reduced the wing-beat frequencies of foragers during flight but did not alter the duration of flight. At the colony level, boscalid ingestion may thereby affect overall health by reducing forager efficiency. Consumption of quercetin, by contrast, led to higher adenosine triphosphate levels in flight muscles and a higher wing-beat frequency. Consuming the two compounds together increased wing beat frequency, demonstrating a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which dietary phytochemicals may act to ameliorate toxic effects of pesticides to promote honey bee health. In carrying out this work, we also introduce two methodological improvements for use in testing for pesticide effects on flight capacity—a “force-feeding” to standardize flight fuel supply and a novel indoor flight treadmill."
Dryad Digital Repository,Demographic mechanisms of inbreeding adjustment through extra-pair reproduction,"1. One hypothesis explaining extra-pair reproduction is that socially monogamous females mate with extra-pair males to adjust the coefficient of inbreeding (f) of extra-pair offspring (EPO) relative to that of within-pair offspring (WPO) they would produce with their socially paired male. Such adjustment of offspring f requires non-random extra-pair reproduction with respect to relatedness, which is in turn often assumed to require some mechanism of explicit pre-copulatory or post-copulatory kin discrimination. 2. We propose three demographic processes that could potentially cause mean f to differ between individual females' EPO and WPO given random extra-pair reproduction with available males without necessarily requiring explicit kin discrimination. Specifically, such a difference could arise if social pairings formed non-randomly with respect to relatedness or persisted non-randomly with respect to relatedness, or if the distribution of relatedness between females and their sets of potential mates changed during the period through which social pairings persisted. 3. We used comprehensive pedigree and pairing data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify these three processes and hence investigate how individual females could adjust mean offspring f through instantaneously random extra-pair reproduction. 4. Female song sparrows tended to form social pairings with unrelated or distantly related males slightly less frequently than expected given random pairing within the defined set of available males. Furthermore, social pairings between more closely related mates tended to be more likely to persist across years than social pairings between less closely related mates. However, these effects were small and the mean relatedness between females and their sets of potential extra-pair males did not change substantially across the years through which social pairings persisted. 5. Our framework and analyses illustrate how demographic and social structuring within populations might allow females to adjust mean f of offspring through random extra-pair reproduction without necessarily requiring explicit kin discrimination, implying that adjustment of offspring f might be an inevitable consequence of extra-pair reproduction. New theoretical and empirical studies are required to explore the general magnitude of such effects and quantify the degree to which they could facilitate or constrain long-term evolution of extra-pair reproduction."
Dryad Digital Repository,Cardinium localization during its parasitoid wasp host’s development provides insights into cytoplasmic incompatibility,"Arthropods harbor heritable intracellular symbionts that may manipulate host reproduction to favor symbiont transmission. In cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), the symbiont sabotages the reproduction of infected males such that high levels of offspring mortality result when they mate with uninfected females. In crosses with infected males and infected females, however, (the “rescue” cross), normal numbers of offspring are produced. A common CI-inducing symbiont, Cardinium hertigii, causes variable levels of CI mortality in the parasitoid wasp, Encarsia suzannae. Previous work correlated CI-induced mortality with male development time in this system, although the timing of Cardinium CI-induction and the relationship between development time and CI mortality was not well understood. Here, using a combination of crosses, manipulation of development time, and fluorescence microscopy, we identify the localization and the timing of the CI-induction step in the Cardinium-E. suzannae system. Antibiotic treatment of adult Cardinium-infected males did not reduce the mortality associated with the CI phenotype, suggesting that CI-alteration occurs prior to adulthood. Our results suggest that the alteration step occurs during the pupal period, and is limited by the duration of pupal development: 1) Encarsia produces most sperm prior to adulthood, 2), FISH localization of Cardinium in testes showed an association with sperm nuclei throughout spermatogenesis but not with mature sperm and 3) two methods of prolonging the pupal period (cool temperatures and the juvenile hormone analog methoprene) both caused greater CI mortality, suggesting the degree of alteration is limited by the duration of the pupal stage. Based on these results, we compare two models for potential mechanisms of Cardinium sperm modification in the context of what is known about analogous mechanisms of Wolbachia, a more extensively studied CI-inducing symbiont.

Dryad Digital Repository,Anthropogenic disturbance and rainfall variation threaten the stability of plant‐ant interactions in the Brazilian Caatinga,"Climate change is projected to exacerbate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance, with negative impacts on ecosystem stability and functioning. We evaluate the additive and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and rainfall variation on the temporal stability of mutualistic EFN‐bearing plant‐ant networks in a Caatinga dry forest. We evaluated whether changes in the stability of these interactions are driven by changes in the stability of the communities of partners involved and/or in ant behavior. We sampled EFN‐bearing plant‐ant networks in sixteen 20m×20m plots distributed across CAD and rainfall gradients. The stability of EFN‐bearing plant and attendant‐ant communities were measured as the inverse of temporal differences in their community structure and composition. We also computed the stability of EFN‐bearing plant‐ant networks by measuring the inverse of temporal differences in network specialization metrics. We found that, in general, the structure and composition of plant and ant interacting communities were similarly stable along both environmental gradients. Only CAD and its interaction with rainfall affected the temporal stability of EFN‐bearing plant diversity, which declined as CAD increased, with a more pronounced relationship in wetter areas. However, variation in levels of CAD and, to a lesser extent, rainfall greatly modulated the stability of EFN‐bearing plant‐ant network specialization. CAD reduced the stability of network generality (specialization at the ant level), an effect that was much stronger in wetter areas. Meanwhile, the stability in network vulnerability (specialization at the plant level) decreased with the increase of CAD and the decrease of rainfall levels. Finally, there was a trend of decreasing stability in specialization of the overall network with increasing CAD. Our results suggest that changes in the structure of interaction networks are mainly driven by a switch in ant behavior rather than by changes in the structure and composition of plant and ant communities between years."
Dryad Digital Repository,Natural hazards and wildlife health: the effects of a volcanic eruption on the Andean condor,"Volcanic eruptions produce health changes in animals that may be associated with emitted gases and deposited ashes. We evaluated whether the Puyehue–Cordón Caulle volcanic eruption in 2011 produced health changes in the threatened Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) living in the area most affected by the eruption, north-western Patagonia. We studied clinical and biochemical parameters of condors examined before and after the eruption. We also examined concentrations of different metals and metalloids in the blood of individuals sampled after the eruption. The most common clinical abnormality associated with the eruptive process was irritating pharyngitis. In condors sampled after the eruption, blood concentrations of albumin, calcium, carotenoids and total proteins decreased to levels under the reference values reported for this species. We found different chemical elements in the blood of these condors after the eruption, such as arsenic and cadmium, with the potential to produce health impacts. Thus, the health of Andean condors was affected in different ways by the eruption; remaining in the affected area appears to have been costly. However, in comparison to other animal species, the health impacts were not as strong and were mainly related to food shortages due to the decrease in availability of livestock carcasses linked to the eruption. This suggests that condors dealt relatively well with this massive event. Future research is needed to evaluate if the health changes we found reduce the survival of this species, and if the cost of inhabiting volcanic areas has any ecological or evolutionary influence on the condor’s life history.

Dryad Digital Repository,Trophic niche changes associated to habitat fragmentation in a Neotropical bat species,"Habitat fragmentation could alter ecological traits including species trophic habits. Here, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios to establish differences in isotopic niche width and food resource use between forest fragments and the continuous forest for the phyllostomid frugivorous bat Artibeus lituratus. Using mist nests, we captured bats from two forest fragments and two sites in continuous forest, and sampled from each individual captured three body tissues with contrasting turnover rates (skin, muscle and liver).  Samples were collected between February-March (austral summer) and between August-September (austral winter). In addition, in each sampling site and season we collected potential food resources (fruits and insects) consumed by our A. lituratus. Our findings indicate that A. lituratus had a predominantly omnivorous diet, with high consumption of insects during summer in forest fragments. The increasing consumption of insects in these fragments seems to have led to a wider isotopic niche, in relation to the continuous forest. Because A. lituratus
is typically a seed disperser, changes in trophic habits in the forest fragments from frugivory to insectivory may diminish their role in forest regeneration."
Dryad Digital Repository,"New species of Franchia and Protozigzagiceras (Ammonoidea, Middle Jurassic): the phyletic origin of Zigzagiceratinae","Three genera and seven species belonging to the subfamily Zigzagiceratinae (family Perisphinctidae) are described from the Lower Bathonian of France and Saudi Arabia. Intraspecific dimorphism is recognized. A revision of the genus Franchia proposed by Sturani (1967), based on the syntypes and new specimens from south-east France, is presented. Franchia arkelli Sturani, Franchia subalpina sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras torrensi (Sturani), Protozigzagiceras tethycum sp. nov., Protozigzagiceras flexum sp. nov. and Protozigzagiceras densum sp. nov. are described from the Digne–Castellane region of south-east France. Megazigzagiceras subarabicum, gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Dharma region of Saudi Arabia. The successive Early Bathonian species of Franchia and Protozigzagiceras herein identified in West Tethyan areas, as members of the Mediterranean–Caucasian Subrealm, formed lasting separate peramorphoclines characterized by increasing hydrodynamic coiling of the shell. In contrast, rapid proterogenesis originated and diversified the earliest Bathonian zigzagiceratin lineages, giving paedomorphic members, commonly neotenic and more scarcely progenetic. Procerites–Siemiradzkia seems to be the oldest zigzagiceratin member in the French Subalpine, Iberian and Lusitanian basins, branched off by paedomorphosis from leptosphinctins at the Bajocian–Bathonian transition. The Mediterranean–Caucasian genera Franchia, Zigzagiceras, Zigzagites and Wagnericeras branched from successive species of Protozigzagiceras, in turn, a direct derivative of Procerites. The oldest lineages of the clade Zigzagiceratinae evolved by iterative, rapid, paedomorphic changes and additional, lasting, peramorphic modifications during the Early Bathonian."

Harvard Dataverse,Replication Data for Chapter 6: What makes internationally-financed adaptation projects focus on local communities? A configurational analysis of 30 Adaptation Fund projects,"There is much scholarly and policy interest in the role that international finance could play in closing the financing gap for community adaptation initiatives. Despite the interest, the overall amount of international adaptation finance that has reached local recipients remains low. What makes internationally-financed climate change adaptation projects focus on investment at the community level is particularly poorly understood. This study systematically assesses conditions that influence the focus on vulnerable local communities in internationally-financed adaptation projects. Using the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol as the case study, we apply fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to analyze 30 AF projects to identify specific configurations of conditions that lead to a stronger or weaker community focus in project design. We find that the absence of high exposure to projected future climate risks is a necessary condition for a weaker community focus in AF projects. Three configurations of sufficient conditions are identified that lead to a stronger community focus. They involve the contextual factors of projected future climate risks, civil society governance, and access modality to AF financing. In particular, AF projects with a stronger community focus are stimulated by the sole presence of higher exposure to projected future climate risks in a group of countries, and by the complementary roles of civil society governance and the access modality to the AF in others. These findings contribute new insights on how to enhance local inclusiveness of global climate finance."

Harvard Dataverse,Global High-Resolution Soil Profile Database for Crop Modeling Applications,"One of the obstacles in applying advanced crop simulation models such as DSSAT at a grid-based platform is the lack of gridded soil input data at various resolutions. Recently, there has been many efforts in scientific communities to develop spatially continuous soil database across the globe. The most representative example is the SoilGrids 1km released by ISRIC in 2014. In addition recent AfSIS project put a lot of efforts to develop more accurate soil database in Africa at high spatial resolution. Taking advantage of those two available high resolution soil databases (SoilGrids 1km and ISRIC-AfSIS at 1km resolution), this project aims to develop a set of DSSAT compatible soil profiles on 5 arc-minute grid (which is HarvestChoice’s standard grid). Six soil properties (bulk density, organic carbon, percentage of clay and silt, soil pH and cation exchange capacity) available from the original SoilGrids 1km or ISRIC-AfSIS were directly used as DSSAT inputs. We applied a pedo-transfer function to derive some soil hydraulic properties (saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil water content at field capacity, wilting point and saturation) which are critical to simulate crop growth. For other required variables, HarvestChoice’s HC27 database are used as a reference. Final outputs are provided in *.SOL file format (DSSAT soil database) for each country at 5-min resolution. In addition, uncertainty maps for organic carbon and soil water content at wilting points at the top 15 cm soil layers were generated to provide brief idea about accuracy of the final products. The generated soil properties were evaluated by visualizing their global maps and by comparing them with IIASA-IFPRI cropland map and AfSIS-GYGA’s available water content maps."

Harvard Dataverse,Replication Data for: The Politics of Accountability in Supreme Court Nominations: Voter Recall and Assessment of Senator Votes on Nominees,"While longstanding theories of political behavior argue that voters do not possess sufficient political knowledge to hold their elected representatives accountable, recent revisionist studies challenge this view, arguing that voters can both follow how their representatives vote and use that information intelligently. We apply the revisionist account to the study of Supreme Court nominations in the modern era. Using survey data on the nominations of Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, we ask whether voters can and do hold senators accountable for their votes on Supreme Court nominees. While our results for Thomas are ambiguous, we find strong evidence for accountability in the case of Sotomayor and Kagan. In particular, we show that voters on average can correctly recall the votes of their senators on these nominees, and that correct recall is correlated with higher levels of education and political knowledge. We then show that voters are more likely to both approve of and vote to re-elect their senator if he or she casts a vote on Sotomayor and Kagan that is in line with voters’ preferences. Finally, we show this effect is quite sizable, as it rivals the effect of agree- ment on other high-profile roll call votes. These results have important implications for both the broader study of representation and for understanding the current politics of Supreme Court nominations."

ImmPort,Human Placental Transcriptome and fetal sex differences in SPTB,"A well-functioning placenta is crucial for normal gestation and regulates the nutrient, gas, and waste exchanges between the maternal and fetal circulations and is an important endocrine organ producing hormones that regulate both the maternal and fetal physiologies during pregnancy. Placental insufficiency is implicated in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). We proposed that deficits in the capacity of the placenta to maintain bioenergetic and metabolic stability during pregnancy may ultimately result in SPTB. To explore our hypothesis, we performed a RNA-seq study in male and female placentas from women with SPTB (<36 weeks gestation) compared to normal pregnancies (?38 weeks gestation) to assess the alterations in the gene expression profiles. We focused exclusively on Black women (cases and controls), who are at the highest risk of SPTB. Six hundred and seventy differentially expressed genes were identified in male SPTB placentas. Among them, 313 and 357 transcripts were increased and decreased, respectively. In contrast, only 61 differentially expressed genes were identified in female SPTB placenta. The ingenuity pathway analysis showed alterations in the genes and canonical pathways critical for regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, detoxification, mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and the extracellular matrix. Many upstream regulators and master regulators important for nutrient-sensing and metabolism were also altered in SPTB placentas, including the PI3K complex, TGFB1/SMADs, SMARCA4, TP63, CDKN2A, BRCA1, and NFAT. The transcriptome was integrated with published human placental metabolome to assess the interactions of altered genes and metabolites. Collectively, significant and biologically relevant alterations in the transcriptome were identified in SPTB placentas with fetal sex disparities. Altered energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and detoxification may underly the mechanisms of placental dysfunction in SPTB"

Here, we obtained tissues from human organ donors to examine T cells across major barrier sites (skin, lung, jejunum), associated lymph nodes, lymphoid organs (spleen, bone marrow), and in circulation. By integrating single-cell protein and transcriptome profiling, we demonstrate that human barrier sites contain tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that exhibit site-adapted profiles for residency, homing, and function distinct from circulating memory T cells. Incorporating T cell receptor and transcriptome analysis, we show that circulating memory T cells are highly expanded, display extensive overlap between sites, and exhibit effector and cytolytic functional profiles, while TRM clones exhibit site-specific expansions and distinct functional capacities. Together, our findings indicate that circulating T cells are more disseminated and differentiated, while TRM exhibit tissue-specific adaptation and clonal segregation, suggesting that strategies to promote barrier immunity require tissue-targeting."

In order to assay quantitative and qualitative differences in T cell responses, we adopted a high-resolution flow cytometry assay that incorporates multiple cytokines and activation markers. Such data are urgently required to guide masking, social distancing, and passive antibody/booster vaccination strategies for potentially vulnerable MM patients treated with these anti-cancer agents as we enter the second fall season of the COVID-19 pandemic."

ImmPort,Heterosubtypic Influenza infection antagonizes elicitation of immunological reactivity to hemagglutinin,"Influenza-specific immunity in humans is unique because there are repeated exposures to viral strains containing genetically conserved epitopes recruiting memory CD4 T cells and novel epitopes stimulating naive CD4 T cells, possibly resulting in competition between memory and naive lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of this competition on CD4 T cell and B cell response specificity using a murine model of sequential influenza infection. We found striking and selective decreases in CD4 T cell reactivity to nonconserved hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes following secondary influenza infection. Surprisingly, this shift in CD4 T cell specificity was associated with dramatic decreases in HA-specific Ab. These results suggest that repeated exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines containing conserved internal proteins may have unintended and negative consequences on the ability to induce HA-specific Ab to novel pandemic strains of influenza. These finding could have important implications on pandemic influenza preparedness strategies. "

ImmPort,Reduced pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in hamsters,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has proven to be highly transmissible and has outcompeted the Delta variant in many regions of the world. Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here, we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods: Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings: Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4%-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10%-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions: These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection, but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease, compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants."

Total RNA obtained from MACS-purified human pDC and mDC (using Miltenyi's Dendritic Cell Isolation Kits) that had been stimulated with the synthetic TLR7/8 ligand 3M-003 (at final concentration of 5 uM) for 1 or 6 hours in vitro compared to unstimulated pDC."
ImmPort,Assessing the role of NLRX1 during mucosal immune responses to H. pylori in mice,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) colonizes 50% of the world’s population resulting in a decades-long gastric infection. Bacterial interaction with host intracellular environment occurs via injection of bacterial components through a TIVSS or intracellular replication. HP has been recognized for its ability to modulate intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLR). Host responses toward the bacterium can result in asymptomatic, pathogenic or even favorable immunity. Mechanisms underlying the dual role of HP as a commensal versus pathogen are not completely understood. We combined computational modeling, bioinformatics and experimental validation to investigate intracellular host-HP interactions. Global transcriptomic analysis on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in a gentamycin protection assay unveiled that intracellular colonization of HP upregulated NOD1, NOD2, NLRP3, NLRC5 and inflammasome components (Caspase-1 and -11) but suppressed regulatory NLRX1 which was inversely correlated to TRAF6, NF-B, proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Loss of NLRX1 facilitates bacterial clearance in BMDM and infected mice. Lastly, we constructed a computational model to shed light on complex immune responses and pathway crosstalk regulated by NLRX1 during infection. In conclusion, NLRX1 is associated with chronic bacterial persistence during H. pylori infection and it may represent an immune evasion mechanism employed by the bacterium to facilitate long-term host colonization."

Study limitations include the small number of infants, the longer mean time to follow-up in the infected group (due to pragmatic constraints related to timing of COVID-19 surges in Boston and the availability of participants for timely follow-up), and the reporting of antibody titers rather than clinical outcomes. Although the antibody titer known to be protective against COVID-19 in infants isunknown, these findings provide further incentive for pregnant individuals to pursue COVID-19 vaccination."

The DTC practice is the MSSM clinical teaching practice.All patients will be required to give three blood samples, one at the time of the first study visit, the second 1-3 month(s) later (at the time of the second study visit), and the third at the end of flu season (end of March) in order to assess the immune response to routinely administered influenza vaccination(s). Relevant medical records will be reviewed to abstract detailed information about pregnancy complications and newborn outcomes.In addition, when the study team is available, cord blood samples and placenta samples may be collected. These will be collected after specimens are processed as needed clinically and before remaining blood and tissues would otherwise be discarded."
ImmPort,Immune Cell Repertoires in Breast Cancer Patients after Adjuvant Chemotherapy,"Adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients causes immune cell depletion at an age when the regenerative capacity is compromised. Successful regeneration requires the recovery of both quantity and quality of immune cell subsets. Although immune cell numbers rebound within a year post-treatment, it is unclear whether overall compositional diversity is recovered. We investigated the regeneration of immune cell complexity by comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients ranging from one to five years post-chemotherapy with those of age-matched healthy controls using mass cytometry and T cell receptor sequencing. These data revealed universal changes in patients' CD4 T cells that persisted for years and consisted of expansion of TH17-like CD4 memory populations with incomplete recovery of CD4 naive T cells. Conversely, CD8 T cells fully recovered within a year. Mechanisms of T cell regeneration however were unbiased as CD4 and CD8 T cell receptor diversity remained high. Likewise, TEMRAs were not expanded indicating that regeneration was not driven by recognition of latent viruses. These data suggest that while CD8 T cell immunity is successfully regenerated, the CD4 compartment may be irreversibly impacted. Moreover, the bias of CD4 memory towards inflammatory effector cells may impact responses to vaccination and infection."

ImmPort,Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"Background: The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk change across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Funding: K.C.M. was supported by National Science Foundation GRFP grant DGE1745303. Y.H.G. and M.L. were funded by the Morris-Singer Foundation.

ImmPort,Whole exome sequencing reveals HSPA1L as a genetic risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and prematurity is further associated with serious morbidities in later life. Genetic and environmental risk factors play a role in the susceptibility to preterm birth. Despite numerous studies, the genetic basis for preterm birth remains poorly defined. We investigated the presence of rare, possibly risk associated nucleotide variants in mothers with spontaneous preterm births (SPTB). The first set of mothers with family history of recurrent preterm births was of northern Finnish origin. An additional set of mothers (sister pairs, both giving birth preterm) of European origin was also studied. Whole exome sequencing identified multiple rare, likely damaging HSPA1L variants in several families affected by SPTB, and this gene was associated with the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway. Potential involvement of one of the HSPA1L variants in SPTB was further supported by large GWAS dataset. In addition, this variant alters protein post-translational modification potential, and thus may affect protein stability and its function as a chaperone."

Mendeley,Evidence of Pulmonary Hypertension after SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Subjects without Previous Significant Cardiovascular Pathology,"Background: Coronavirus (Covid-19) infection represents a serious medical condition, often associated with cardiovascular complications, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and right ventricle dysfunction (RVD). The aim of this study is to show, by means of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the presence of an increased estimated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery (esPAP) and altered right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) in patients without history of PH. Methods: In a group of 91 patients, aged under 55 years, hospitalized for a moderate Covid-19 infection, a thorough cardiologic and TTE examination were performed two months after discharge. Their initial thorax computer-tomography (TCT) images and laboratory data were accessed from the electronic data base of the hospital. Results: We observed an increased prevalence of PH (7.69%) and RVD (10.28%), significantly correlated with the initial levels of the TCT score and inflammatory factors (p ˂ 0.001), but borderline changes were observed in more patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that these factors and RV-GLS explain 89.5% of elevated esPAP. Conclusions: In COVID-19 infection, PH and RVD are common complications, being encountered after the recovery even in moderate cases. It appears to be a connection between their severity and the extent of the initial pulmonary injury and of the inflammatory response.

Mendeley,"Using Agent-Based Modeling to Understand and Assess Demographic (In)Equity of Extreme Heat / Direct Sunlight Exposure In Norfolk, VA Due To Lack Of Tree Canopies","Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can result in illness and death. In urban areas of dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat, extreme heat conditions can arise regularly and create harmful environmental exposures for residents daily during certain parts of the year. Tree canopies provide shade and help to cool the environment, making mature trees with large canopies a simple and effective way to reduce urban heat. We develop a demographically representative 1 (agent): 1 (person) agent-based model to understand the extent to which different demographics of residents in Norfolk, VA are equitably shaded from extreme heat conditions during a walk on a clear summer day. We use the model to assess the extent to which the city's Tree Planting Plan will be effective in remediating any existing inequities. Our results show that inequitable conditions exist for residents (1) at different education levels, (2) at different income levels and, (3) living in different census tracts. Norfolk's Tree Planting Program effectively reduces the distance residents of all demographics walk in extreme heat. However, residents of the city at lower income levels still experience statically significantly more extreme heat exposure due to a lack of tree canopies in summer months than those at higher income levels."

Mendeley,Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Life of Higher Education Students: Global Survey Dataset from the First Wave,"The Covid-19 pandemic has completely reshaped the lives of people around the world, including the lives of higher education students. Beyond serious health consequences for a proportion of those directly affected by the virus, the pandemic holds important implications for the life and work of higher education students, considerably affecting their physical and mental well-being. To capture how students perceived the first wave of the pandemic’s impact, one of the most comprehensive and large-scale online surveys across the world was conducted. Carried out between 5 May 2020 and 15 June 2020, the survey came at a time when most countries were experiencing the arduous lockdown restrictions. The online questionnaire was prepared in seven different languages (English, Italian, North Macedonian, Portuguese, Romanian,  Spanish, Turkish) and covered various aspects of higher education students’ life, including socio-demographic and academic characteristics,  academic life, infrastructure and skills for studying from home, social life, emotional life and life circumstances. Using the convenience  sampling method, the online questionnaire was distributed to higher education students (aged 18 and over) and enrolled in a higher education  institution. The final dataset consisted of 31,212 responses from 133 countries and 6 continents. The data may prove useful for researchers  studying the pandemic’s impacts on various aspects of student life. Policymakers can utilize the data to determine the best solutions as they formulate policy recommendations and strategies to support students during this and any future pandemic."

NCBI GEO,TRAF7 is an essential regulator of vascular integrity,"Targeted deletion of TRAF7 revealed that it is a crucial part of shear stress-responsive MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 signaling pathway induced in endothelial cells by blood flow. Similarly, to Mekk3-, Mek5- or Erk5-deficient mice, Traf7-deficient embryos died in utero around midgestation due to impaired endothelial cell integrity. They displayed significantly lower expression of transcription factor Klf2, an essential regulator of vascular hemodynamic forces downstream of the MEKK3-MEK-ERK5 signaling pathway. Deletion of Traf7 in endothelial cells of postnatal mice was also associated with severe cerebral hemorrhage. Here, we show that besides MEKK3 and MEK5, TRAF7 associates with a planar cell polarity protein SCRIB. SCRIB binds with an N-terminal region of TRAF7, while MEKK3 associates with the C-terminal WD40 domain. Downregulation of TRAF7 as well as SCRIB inhibited fluid shear stress-induced phosphorylation of ERK5 in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that TRAF7 and SCRIB may comprise an upstream part of the MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 signaling pathway.Objective: to present first in vivo experimental evidence of TRAF7 function by using global and endothelium-specific TRAF7 knockout mice and comparing transcriptomes of developing embryos.

NCBI GEO,Resolving the graft ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplantation at the single cell resolution,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains the major reason for impaired donor graft function and increased mortality post-liver transplantation. The mechanism of IRI involves multiple pathophysiological processes and numerous types of cells. However, a systematic and comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile of intrahepatic cells during liver transplantation is still unclear. We performed a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 14,313 cells from liver tissues collected from pre-procurement, at the end of preservation and 2 h post-reperfusion. We made detailed annotations of mononuclear phagocyte, endothelial cell, NK/T, B and plasma cell clusters, and we described the dynamic changes of the transcriptome of these clusters during IRI and the interaction between mononuclear phagocyte clusters and other cell clusters. In addition, we found that TNFAIP3 interacting protein 3 (TNIP3), specifically and highly expressed in Kupffer cell clusters post-reperfusion, may have a protective effect on IRI. In summary, our study provides the first dynamic transcriptome map of intrahepatic cell clusters during liver transplantation at single-cell resolution.

NCBI GEO,aHDF- and PB-iPSC clones from the same individuals,"Hepatocytes generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are unprecedented resources for pharmaceuticals and cell therapy. However, little attention has so far been paid to variations among hiPSC lines in terms of their hepatic differentiation. We developed an improved hepatic differentiation protocol and compared multiple hiPSC lines. This comparison indicated that the hepatic differentiation propensity varies among sibling hiPSC clones derived from the same adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDFs). In addition, hiPSC clones derived from peripheral blood cells (PB-iPSCs) consistently showed good hepatic differentiation efficiency, whereas many hiPSC clones from adult dermal fibroblasts (aHDF-iPSCs) showed poor hepatic differentiation. However, when we compared hiPSCs from blood and dermal fibroblasts from the same individuals, we found that variations in hepatic differentiation were largely attributable to donor differences, rather than to the types of the original cells. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed variations in hepatic differentiation, we performed microarray analyses of sibling aHDF-iPSC clones, and aHDF- and PB-iPSC clones from the same individuals.

Furthermore we have linked the developmental interactome to individual blastomeres and to later cell lineage.  This new understanding has clinical implications for understanding the impact of fertility treatments and developmental programming of long term health.

NCBI GEO,Filtering of RNA-seq datasets and differences between cell types in global coordination of splicing and proportion of highly expressed genes,"The goal of this study was to investigate whether mammalian cell types intrinsically differ in global coordination of gene splicing and expression levels. We analyzed RNA-seq transcriptome profiles of 8 different purified mouse cell types. We found that different cell types vary in proportion of highly expressed genes and the number of alternatively spliced transcripts expressed per gene, and that the cell types that express more variants of alternatively spliced transcripts per gene are those that have higher proportion of highly expressed genes. Cell types segregated into two clusters based on high or low proportion of highly expressed genes. Biological functions involved in negative regulation of gene expression were enriched in the group of cell types with low proportion of highly expressed genes, and biological functions involved in regulation of transcription and RNA splicing were enriched in the group of cell types with high proportion of highly expressed genes. These data reveal specific candidate genes, which may be involved in global coordination of balance in the transcriptome.

The raw reads were reprocessed as follows. Reads were mapped to mouse reference genome mm10 (UCSC Genome Browser) and a comprehensive transcriptome annotation database GTF file, which was assembled by using the UCSC Table Browser Intersection utility to merge the GENCODE M4 transcripts in a non-redundant manner with the UCSC Gene Track transcripts that did not overlap more than 90% with the GENCODE transcripts. The raw reads were mapped using the TopHat/Bowtie2/Cufflinks pipeline, with -g option, to construct merged GTF file that included the annotated and novel transcript structures from all samples. Then, the IntersectBed tool (Bedtools) was used to retain only the reads that mapped to the merged GTF, which was converted to BED with Gtf2bed tool (Bedops). This filtering step allowed selecting the reads which contributed to the identified gene structures, and exclude noise and artifacts even if they mapped to the genome but did not contribute to gene structure. Next, only uniquely mapped and properly paired reads were selected using View -bq 4 -bh -f2 -F12 command (Samtools). After this step, DownsampleSam tool (Picard) was used to randomly subsample equal number of paired reads, which provided representative samples of the same size for all samples (34.6M per sample/replicate; reads count with Flagstat, Samtools). The reprocessed samples were reanalyzed as follows: The TopHat/Bowtie2/Cufflinks/Cuffdiff pipeline with -g option was used for determining normalized expression in FPKMs in each replicate of each sample with Cuffdiff’s across-sample normalization. After the cell types were segregated into two clusters based on higher or lower proportion of the highly expressed genes, the differential expression analysis was preformed between the two groups, which were treated as two conditions. For this analysis, each replicate of each cell type was assigned to one of only two cluster groups. For differential expression analysis, the Cuffdiff q-value cut off was set to 0.05. Software versions used: Tophat 2.0.12, Bowtie 2.2.4, Cufflinks 2.2.1, Samtools 0.1.19, Picard 1.79, Bedops 2.4.2, Bedtools 2.19.0.

NCBI GEO,Radiosensitive hematopoietic cells determine the extent of skin inflammation in experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita,"Animal models have enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. For these models, genetically identical, inbred mice have commonly been used. Different inbred mouse strains, however, show a high variability in disease manifestation. Identifying the factors that influence this disease variability could provide unrecognized insights into pathogenesis. We established a novel antibody transfer-induced model of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), an autoimmune disease characterized by (muco)-cutaneous blistering caused by anti-type VII collagen (COL7) autoantibodies. Blistering after anti-COL7 IgG (directed against the von-Willebrand-factor A like domain 2) transfer showed clear variability among inbred mouse strains; i.e. severe cutaneous blistering and inflammation in C57Bl/6J, and absence of skin lesions in MRL/MpJ mice. The transfer of anti-COL7 IgG into irradiated, EBA-resistant MRL/MpJ mice, rescued by transplantation with bone marrow from EBA-susceptible B6.AK-H2k mice, induced blistering. To the contrary, irradiated EBA-susceptible B6.AK-H2k mice that were rescued using MRL/MpJ bone marrow were devoid of blistering. In vitro, immune complex activation of neutrophils from C57Bl/6J or MRL/MpJ mice showed an impaired ROS release from the latter, whereas no differences were observed after PMA activation. This finding was paralleled by divergent expression profiles of immune-complex activated neutrophils from either C57Bl/6J or MRL/MpJ mice. Collectively, we demonstrate that radiosensitive cells determine the varying extent of skin inflammation and blistering in the end-stage effector phase of EBA.We used microarray to differentiate between the molecular response for the immune complex stimulated neutrophils in MRL/MpJ and C57Bl/6J mice
To unravel the molecular basis for the different response to immune complex (IC) stimulation between MRL/MpJ and C57Bl/6J mice, the cells were activated using IC, and differential expression using microarray was compared between resting or activated neutrophils from MRL/MpJ or C57Bl/6J mice."

NCBI GEO,Identification of determinants of differential chromatin accessibility through a massively parallel genome-integrated reporter assay,"Here we introduce the Multiplexed Integrated Accessibility Assay (MIAA), a multiplexed parallel reporter assay which measures changes to genome accessibility as a result of the integration of synthetic oligonucleotide phrase libraries into a controlled, natively inaccessible genomic context. We apply MIAA to measure the effects of sequence motifs on cell type-specific DNA accessibility between mouse embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm cells, screening a total of 7,905 distinct phrases. MIAA is able to recapitulate differential accessibility patterns of 100-nt sequences derived from natively differential genomic regions, identifying the presence of E-box motifs common to epithelial-mesenchymal transition driver transcription factors in stem cell-specific accessible regions that become repressed during differentiation to endoderm. We further present causal evidence that a single binding motif for a key regulatory transcription factor is sufficient to open chromatin, and classify sets of stem cell-specific, endoderm-specific, and shared pioneer factor motifs. We also demonstrate that over-expression of two definitive endoderm transcription factors, Brachyury and FoxA2, results in changes to accessibility in phrases containing their respective DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we use MIAA results to explore the order of motif interactions and identify preferential motif ordering arrangements that appear to have an effect on accessibility.

NCBI GEO,Lymphatic Tissues of Sooty Mangabeys and Rhesus Macaques in Early SIV Infection,"Transcriptional Profiling Reveals Distinguishing Features of Immune Activation in the Lymphatic Tissues of Sooty Mangabeys and Rhesus Macaques in Early SIV InfectionImmune activation in the chronic stages of HIV-1 and SIV infection of rhesus macaques is thought to play a critical role in CD4+ T cell depletion and progression to AIDS. Conversely, the lack of immune activation in the chronic stages of SIV infection of sooty mangabeys is thought to protect this species from a pathogenic outcome. This critical difference in immune activation in rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys has recently been shown to be established in the early stages of SIV infection where there is immune activation in both species, but in sooty mangabeys immune activation is subsequently resolved. Here we report the results of a microarray analysis of early SIV infection in the lymphatic tissues of rhesus macaques and sooty mangabeys that provides a comprehensive view of the distinguishing features of immune activation and host defenses in the two species. We confirm immune activation in sooty mangabeys, but show that it is less robust than in rhesus macaques, where positive feedback loops involving cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, and chemokines and their ligands amplify the response to early SIV infection. We confirm resolution of immune activation in sooty mangabeys, but show it to be partial and selective, identifying the interferon system and CD38 as key correlates of outcome. We also identify potentially novel immunoregulatory mechanisms that mediate resolution, and defensins as host defenses sooty mangabeys employ as expression of other innate immune system effectors declines.The studies we report here were undertaken in a collaborative longitudinal analysis of early SIV infection in SMs described in Bosinger et al and previously reported studies (Estes et al.,  J Immunol 1008, 180, 6798-6807.). Briefly, SMs were inoculated i.v. with 1 ml of plasma from an experimentally SIVsmm-infected SM sampled at day 11 post infection, with a viral load 107 copies/ml. In our studies we analyzed axillary or inguinal lymph node biopsies that had been obtained from two SMs prior to infection; two SMs at the peak of viral replication at 14 dpi; and two SMs at 30 dpi as viral loads were decreasing to set point. We analyzed axillary or inguinal LNs from 4 RMs without SIV infection and LNs from four RMs infected intravaginally with 2x105 TCID50 of SIVmac239 and sacrificed at 14 dpi the peak of viral replication from two cross-sectional studies described in (Miller et al., The Journal of Virology 2005, 79, 9217-9227.). For lymph node (LN) biopsies, animals were anesthetized with Ketamine or Telazol; the skin over the axillary or inguinal region was clipped and surgically prepped. An incision was made over the LN, which was exposed by blunt dissection and excised over clamps. A portion of the lymph node biopsy for microarray analysis was snap frozen in liquid N2. All animals were housed and cared for at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the regulations of the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care standards. These studies were approved by the Emory University and University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committees (IACUC).Microarray AnalysisRNA extractions, synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA probes, microarray hybridization, and data analysis followed previously published procedures (Li et al., The Journal of infectious diseases 2004, 189, 572-582; Li et al., J Immunol 2009, 2009, 183: 1975–1982.). Briefly, snap-frozen lymph node was homogenized in TRIzol. Total RNA was isolated and further purified. Double stranded cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA probes were synthesized, column purified and fragmented. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip® Rhesus Macaque Genome Array. After hybridization, chips were washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and scanned with GeneChip Operating Software at the Biomedical Genomics Center at the University of Minnesota. Preparation of cRNA probes and microarray hybridizations were done in duplicate for each RNA sample.Cel. files were uploaded into the Expressionist program (Genedata, Pro version 5.1) and the expression level for each of the 47,000 transcripts in the arrays were analyzed using the RMA algorithm. The expression levels from duplicate microarrays of the same animal’s RNA were correlated and averaged. Tests for differences between the before and after infection at various time points were conducted using the 2-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Fold differences in the level of gene expression between after infection and before infection were calculated with the ratio of the means. After statistical analysis, data was sorted based on these transcript cutoffs: p-value of < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2.0. Significantly changed genes and transcripts were uploaded into NetAffix Analysis Center (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx) to query gene ontology information and into Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com) for gene annotation and pathway analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis was carried out by using Spotfire for DecisionSite for Functional Genomics.
We used affymetrix rhesus microarrays to profile the host transcriptional response to SIV in lymph nodes obtained from SM (Sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys)) and RMs ( Rhesus Macaques, Macaca mulatta) in the first two weeks of infection in studies described by Bosinger et al. (GEO accession number GSE16147) of the transcriptional profiles in peripheral blood. We confirm in these genome-wide comparisons that immune activation is a shared feature of early infection in the two species, but show that the breadth of the changes in RMs is much greater than in SMs, with evidence of positive feedback loops that amplify innate and cellular responses in RMs. We also confirm evidence of resolution of immune activation in SMs, but were surprised to find little evidence at the transcriptional level of increased expression of genes that might mediate that resolution. Lastly, we show that as expression of genes involved in host defenses decline in SMs, there is increased expression of defensins that again may represent a species-specific host defense mechanism. Samples: 12 Sooty Mangabeys (uninfected, 14 dpi, and 30 dpi) and 16 Rhesus Macaques (uninfected and 14 dpi)."

NCBI GEO,A single local delivery of paclitaxel and nucleic acids via an immunoactive polymer eliminates solid tumors and induces systemic antitumor immunity,"Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, hard-to-reach, unidentified tumors remain a significant clinical challenge. A promising approach is to treat locatable and accessible tumors locally and stimulate antitumor immunity in situ to exert systemic effects against distant tumors. We hypothesize that a local carrier of immunotherapeutics is critical to the effective activation of in-situ antitumor immunity. Here, we develop a polyethyleneimine derivative (2E’), which activates immune cells and co-delivers hydrophobic immunogenic cell death inducers and immunomodulatory nucleic acids/nucleotides. A single local administration of 2E’ or its combination with paclitaxel and PD-L1 siRNA or cyclic dinucleotide induces strong antitumor immunity, resulting in immediate regression of large established tumors, tumor-free survival, and the resistance to rechallenge and metastasis in different models. This study supports that effective in-situ induction of antitumor immunity can lead to systemic protection from distant and recurrent diseases, where 2E’ plays multiple roles as a simple and versatile carrier of immunotherapeutics.

In order to develop a novel anti-HBV drug for functional or complete cure, we performed in silico screening using a structure of CDM-3008-binding pocket in IFNAR2.Approach & Results: The binding pocket of CDM-3008 in IFNAR2 was determined by LC-MS/MS using a CDM-3008-based molecular probe, CDM-3095 and a recombinant protein of IFNAR2 extracellular region. We conducted in silico screening of the binding compounds fitting the steric structure of the pocket. We identified 37 compounds and named them iCDM-1–37. We found that iCDM-34 showed anti-HCV and anti-HBV activities. We measured the anti-HBV activity of iCDM-34 with or without entecavir (ETV). iCDM-34 suppressed pregenome RNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), HBsAg, and HBeAg and clearly exhibited synergistic inhibitory effects with ETV. Metabolic stability of iCDM-34 was measured in human, mouse, and rat microsomal fractions. iCDM-34 was stable in human liver microsomal fraction. Furthermore, anti-HBV activity in human hepatocyte-chimeric mice revealed that iCDM-34 was not effective as a single agent, but when combined with ETV, it suppressed HBV DNA and cccDNA compared to ETV alone. Phosphoproteome analysis showed no activation of IFN signaling with iCDM-34 treatment. Transcriptome analysis of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) revealed no increase in the expression, while downstream factors of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) showed increased expression.  Conclusion: iCDM-34 is a novel anti-HBV drug that induces AhR activation and suppresses cccDNA.Conclusion: iCDM-34 is a novel anti-HBV drug that induces AhR activation and suppresses cccDNA.
Overall, 12 samples were analyzed. PXB cells cultured in 24-well plates were infected with 3 genome equivalents per cell of HBV C_AT. After 24 days of infection, the cells were treated with DMSO, 0.3 and 30 microM iCDM-34 or 1000 IU/ml IFNalpha for 7 days (n=3)."

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of pancreatic cancer tissue from control (EL1) and METTL3-overexpressing (WTg). Overall design: FVB/N-EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg mice (Common Name, EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg, abbreviated as EL1) were used to transgenic mice experiments. Briefly, for co-injection to make EL1-Luc/EL1-TAg, two cDNA was used: the oncogenic cDNAs were prepared from 2.7-kb SV40 Large T-antigen, whereas the reporter cDNAs were prepared from Firefly Luciferase cDNA pGL3-Basic Vector. Each cDNA was fused with rodent pancreatic Elastase I promoter. For the construct of Mettl3 overexpressed transgenic mice, three 6-week-old female BL/6 mice were bled with two 6-week-old male BL/6 mice, and fertilized eggs were taken to perform cDNA injection in vitro to make transgenic animals. For the cDNA injection, the open-reading-flame of Mettl3 was cloned from C57BL/6J mice by PCR, of which sequence were verified; Mettl3 cDNA was fused with chimeric CAG promoter, a composite of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer with the chicken beta actin promoter (CBA). The Mettl3 overexpressing mice were crossed with EL1 mice to make the double transgenic mice (WTg). Mice were confirmed as expected genotype, by PCR. The WTg mice formed abdominal tumors, which were apparent after 6 weeks; the luminous imaging followed to administration of vivoGlo Luciferin as 150 microgram/mouse(g) confirmed the presence of tumor(s) in pancreatic region under the IVIS imaging system (SPI), whereas the opened observation of abdomen indicated around 2-cm tumor(s), and tumors were processed for the preparation of single cells.

NCBI SRA,Nanoparticles-mediated TRPV1 channel blockade amplifies cancer thermo-immunotherapy via heat shock factor 1 modulation,"Survival of malignant tumours is highly relevant to their intrinsic self-defense pathways such as heat shock protein (HSP) during cancer therapy, yet precisely dismantling self-defenses to amplify antitumour potency remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that nanoparticles-mediated transient receptor potential vanilloid member 1 (TRPV1) channel blockade selectively modulates heat shock factor 1 to suppress dual self-defense pathways for potentiating thermo-immunotherapy. TRPV1 blockade is identified to inhibit calcium influx and subsequent nuclear translocation of HSF1 upon hyperthermia, leading to selective suppression of stressfully overexpressed HSP70 for enhancing thermotherapeutic efficacy against a variety of primary, metastatic and recurrent tumours. Particularly, the suppression of HSF1 translocation further restrains TGF pathway to apparently degrade extracellular matrix in tumour for improving the infiltration of antitumour therapeutics and immune cells into highly fibrotic and immunosuppressive pancreatic cancers, ultimately synergizing with anti-PD-L1 antibody to retrieve thermo-immunotherapy with tumour-eradicable and immune memory effects. The nanoparticles-mediated TRPV1 blockade represents as an effective and universal approach to selectively dismantle self-defenses for potent cancer therapy."

NCBI SRA,Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid reveals factors contributing to the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in lung cance,"Bronchoalveolar lavage is commonly performed to examine inflammation and responsible pathogens in lung diseases, and its findings may be used to assess the immune profile of the lung tumor microenvironment (TME). To investigate whether analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) can help identify non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), BALF and blood were prospectively collected before initiating nivolumab. The secreted molecules, microbiome, and cellular profiles based on BALF and blood analysis were compared regarding therapeutic effect in 12 patients. Compared to non-responders, responders showed significantly higher CXCL9 levels and greater diversity in the lung microbiome profile in BALF, and greater frequency of CD56+ subset in blood T cells, whereas no significant difference was found in PD-L1 expression of tumor cells. Antibiotic treatment in a preclinical lung cancer model significantly decreased CXCL9 in the lung TME, resulting in reduced sensitivity to nivolumab, which was reversed by CXCL9 induction in tumor cells. Thus, CXCL9 and the microbiome in the lung TME might be associated with each other, and their balance could contribute to nivolumab sensitivity in NSCLC patients. BALF analysis can help predict the efficacy of ICIs when performed along with currently approved examinations. Overall design: The transcriptome profiles of bulk cells collected from BALF were compared between four responders and three non-responders."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Structural Basis for Graded Inhibition of CREB:DNA Interactions by Multisite Phosphorylation.,"Phosphorylation of the kinase inducible domain (KID) of the cyclic AMP response element binding transcription factor (CREB) regulates its function through several mechanisms. Transcriptional activation occurs following phosphorylation at serine 133, but multisite phosphorylation in a neighboring region termed the CK cassette, residues 108-117, results in inhibition of CREB-mediated transcription. A molecular-level understanding of the mechanism of these opposing reactions has been lacking, in part because of the difficulty of preparing multiply phosphorylated CREB in vitro. By substituting a single residue, we have generated an engineered mammalian CREB in which the CK cassette can be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinases and have characterized its interactions with cyclic AMP response element DNA. Phosphorylation of the CK cassette promotes an intramolecular interaction between the KID domain and the site of DNA binding, the basic region of the C-terminal basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain. Competition between the phosphorylated KID domain and DNA for bZip binding results in a decreased affinity of CREB for DNA. The binding free energy calculated from the dissociation constant is directly proportional to the number of phosphate groups in the CK cassette, indicating that the DNA binding is regulated by a rheostat-like mechanism. The rheostat is modulated by variation of the concentration of cations such as Mg2+ and by alternative isoforms such as the natural CREB isoform that lacks residues 162-272. Multisite phosphorylation of CREB represents a versatile mechanism by which transcription can be tuned to meet the variable needs of the cell."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),PPAR? activation following apoptotic cell instillation promotes resolution of lung inflammation and fibrosis via regulation of efferocytosis and proresolving cytokines.,"Changes in macrophage phenotype have been implicated in apoptotic cell-mediated immune modulation via induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?). In this study, we characterized PPAR? induction by apoptotic cell instillation over the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. Next, the role of PPAR? activation in resolving lung inflammation and fibrosis was investigated. Our data demonstrate that apoptotic cell instillation after bleomycin results in immediate and prolonged enhancement of PPAR? mRNA and protein in alveolar macrophages and lung. Moreover, PPAR? activity and expression of its target molecules, including CD36, macrophage mannose receptor, and arginase 1, were persistently enhanced following apoptotic cell instillation. Coadministration of the PPAR? antagonist, GW9662, reversed the enhanced efferocytosis, and the reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, neutrophil recruitment, myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline contents, and fibrosis markers, including type 1 collagen ?2, fibronectin and ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA), in the lung by apoptotic cell instillation. In addition, inhibition of PPAR? activity reversed the expression of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), interleukin (IL)-10, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These findings indicate that one-time apoptotic cell instillation contributes to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic responses via upregulation of PPAR? expression and subsequent activation, leading to regulation of efferocytosis and production of proresolving cytokines."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Control of tumor bioenergetics and survival stress signaling by mitochondrial HSP90s.,"Tumors successfully adapt to constantly changing intra- and extracellular environments, but the wirings of this process are still largely elusive. Here, we show that heat-shock-protein-90-directed protein folding in mitochondria, but not cytosol, maintains energy production in tumor cells. Interference with this process activates a signaling network that involves phosphorylation of nutrient-sensing AMP-activated kinase, inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1, induction of autophagy, and expression of an endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. This signaling network confers a survival and proliferative advantage to genetically disparate tumors, and correlates with worse outcome in lung cancer patients. Therefore, mitochondrial heat shock protein 90s are adaptive regulators of tumor bioenergetics and tractable targets for cancer therapy."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Carbapenem Resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and Other Acinetobacter spp. Causing Neonatal Sepsis: Focus on NDM-1 and Its Linkage to ISAba125.,"Carbapenem-resistant determinants and their surrounding genetic structure were studied in Acinetobacter spp. from neonatal sepsis cases collected over 7 years at a tertiary care hospital. Acinetobacter spp. (n = 68) were identified by ARDRA followed by susceptibility tests. Oxacillinases, metallo-?-lactamases (MBLs), extended-spectrum ?-lactamases and AmpCs, were detected phenotypically and/or by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Transconjugants possessing the bla NDM-1(New Delhi metallo-?-lactamase) underwent further analysis for plasmids, integrons and associated genes. Genetic environment of the carbapenemases were studied by PCR mapping and DNA sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for sepsis caused by NDM-1-harboring organisms. A. baumannii (72%) was the predominant species followed by A. calcoaceticus (10%), A. lwoffii (6%), A. nosocomialis (3%), A. junni (3%), A. variabilis (3%), A. haemolyticus (2%), and 14TU (2%). Fifty six percent of the isolates were meropenem-resistant. Oxacillinases present were OXA-23-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-51-like, predominately in A. baumannii. NDM-1 was the dominant MBL (22%) across different Acinetobacter spp. Isolates harboring NDM-1 also possessed bla (VIM-2, PER-1, VEB-2, CTX-M-15), armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr genes. bla NDM-1was organized in a composite transposon between two copies of ISAba125 in the isolates irrespective of the species. Further, OXA-23-like gene and OXA-58-like genes were linked with ISAba1 and ISAba3 respectively. Isolates were clonally diverse. Integrons were variable in sequence but not associated with carbapenem resistance. Most commonly found genes in the 5' and 3'conserved segment were aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadB, aadA2, aac4'), non-enzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA1g) and ADP-ribosylation genes (arr2, arr3). Outborn neonates had a significantly higher incidence of sepsis due to NDM-1 harboring isolates than their inborn counterparts. This study demonstrates the significance of both A. baumannii and other species of Acinetobacter in cases of neonatal sepsis over an extended period. Oxacillinases and bla NDM-1 are the major contributors to carbapenem resistance. The dissemination of the bla NDM-1 is likely linked to Tn125 in diverse clones of the isolates."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),A protocol for the subcellular fractionation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using nitrogen cavitation and density gradient centrifugation.,"Most protocols for yeast subcellular fractionation involve the use of mechanical shear forces to lyse the spheroplasts produced by the enzymatic digestion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. These mechanical homogenization procedures often involve the manual use of devices such as the Dounce homogenizer, and so are very operator-dependent and, in consequence, lack reproducibility. Here, we report a highly reproducible method of homogenizing yeast cells based on nitrogen cavitation. This has been optimized to allow efficient release of subcellular compartments that show a high degree of integrity. The protocol remains effective and reproducible across a range of sample volumes and buffer environments. The subsequent separation method, which employs both sucrose and iodixanol density gradients, has been developed to resolve the major membrane-bound compartments of S. cerevisiae. We present an integrated protocol that is fast, facile, robust and efficient and that will enable 'omics' studies of the subcellular compartments of S. cerevisiae and other yeasts."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 Induces A20 Expression via Toll-Like Receptor 2 Signaling and Inhibits the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Activation of Nuclear Factor-kappa B and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases in Peritoneal Macrophages.,"Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) has been reported to ameliorate the development of autoimmune diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis in mice and inhibit interleukin (IL)-6 production in antigen-presenting cells in vitro. Regulation of cytokine production by antigen-presenting cells might be critical for the anti-inflammatory function of LH2171 in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism and contributing components of LH2171-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production are unclear. Here, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of LH2171 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, as a model of antigen-presenting cells, necessary for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. LH2171 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1? cytokines. It also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (NF-?B/MAPKs). Moreover, LH2171 induced gene expression of several negative regulators of NF-?B/MAPKs. Among these regulators, A20 was strongly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels upon LH2171 treatment. The cell wall fraction of LH2171 also demonstrated a similar increase in A20 gene expression and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. These results suggest that the cell wall may be one of the anti-inflammatory components of LH2171. Since cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LH2171 was mediated by TLR2 signaling. Specifically, LH2171-mediated IL-6 suppression and A20 upregulation in wild-type macrophages were reversed and significantly reduced in TLR2 knock-out macrophages. These results suggest that LH2171 induces A20 expression via TLR2 signaling, inhibiting the activation of NF-?B/MAPKs and cytokine production in antigen-presenting cells. This might contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of LH2171 on autoimmune diseases."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Blood lipids and the incidence of atrial fibrillation: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Framingham Heart Study.,"Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Its role in the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.We studied 7142 men and women from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study who did not have prevalent AF at baseline and were not on lipid-lowering medications. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using standard procedures. Incident AF during follow-up was identified from hospital discharge codes; review of medical charts; study electrocardiograms; and, in MESA only, Medicare claims. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of AF by clinical categories of blood lipids in each cohort. Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using inverse of variance weighting. During 9.6 years of mean follow-up, 480 AF cases were identified. In a combined analysis of multivariable-adjusted results from both cohorts, high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with lower AF risk (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.87 in those with levels ?60 mg/dL versus <40 mg/dL), whereas high triglycerides were associated with higher risk of AF (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.05 in those with levels ?200 mg/dL versus <150 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with the risk of AF.In these 2 community-based cohorts, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol were associated with the risk of AF, accounting for other cardiometabolic risk factors."

Examination showed dysarthria, facial dystonia, bibrachial dystonia, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and emotional incontinence. Downward supranuclear gaze palsy was prominent with a ""Round the Houses"" sign. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and medulla, electroneurography, and cerebrospinal fluid were normal. A computed tomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly. This combination of progressive neurological symptoms together with hepatosplenomegaly was suggestive of inborn error of metabolism. A bone marrow biopsy showed an increased number of macrophages with foamy content, highly suggestive of lysosomal disease. Plasmatic chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 were increased. Genetic testing showed heterozygosis for the variation c.1070C?T (p.Ser357Leu) and c.1843?T (Arg615Cys), confirming the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). The ""Round the Houses"" sign has only been described in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This sign is described as an inability to produce pure vertical saccades along the midline and instead moving the eyes in a lateral arc to accomplish the movement. The observation of this sign in a patient with NPC indicates that this bedside finding is not specific for PSP, but a sign of medial longitudinal fasciculus dysfunction. The presence of facial dystonia with facial grimacing together with supranuclear gaze palsy is highly characteristic and useful for the diagnosis of NPC. NPC is an important underdiagnosed condition, given the availability of treatment and a mean diagnostic delay of 6 years."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Emerging Potential of Exosomes in Regenerative Medicine for Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis.,"Exosomes are nanosized vesicles (30-140 nm) of endocytic origin that play important roles in regenerative medicine. They are derived from cell membranes during endocytic internalization and stabilize in biological fluids such as blood and synovia. Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is a degenerative disease, which, in addition to chronic pain, is characterized by progressive cartilage breakdown, condylar bone remodeling, and synovitis. However, traditional clinical treatments have limited symptom- and structure-modifying effects to restore damaged cartilage and other TMJ tissues. This is due to the limited self-healing capacity of condylar cartilage. Recently, stem-cell-derived exosomes have been studied as an alternative therapeutic approach to tissue repair and regeneration. It is known that trophic regulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects under pathological conditions, and research on MSC-derived exosomes is rapidly accumulating. MSC-derived exosomes mimic the major therapeutic effects of MSCs. They affect the activity of immune effector cells and possess multilineage differentiation potential, including chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, exosomes are capable of regenerating cartilage or osseous compartments and restoring injured tissues and can treat dysfunction and pain caused by TMJ OA. In this review, we looked at the uniqueness of TMJ, the pathogenesis of TMJ OA, and the potential role of MSC-derived exosomes for TMJ cartilage and bone regeneration."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Investigating the Vascular Toxicity Outcomes of the Irreversible Proteasome Inhibitor Carfilzomib.,"BACKGROUND:Carfilzomib's (Cfz) adverse events in myeloma patients include cardiovascular toxicity. Since carfilzomib's vascular effects are elusive, we investigated the vascular outcomes of carfilzomib and metformin (Met) coadministration. METHODS:Mice received: (i) saline; (ii) Cfz; (iii) Met; (iv) Cfz+Met for two consecutive (acute) or six alternate days (subacute protocol). Leucocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and serum NOx levels were determined and aortas underwent vascular and molecular analyses. Mechanistic experiments were recapitulated in aged mice who received similar treatment to young animals. Primary murine (prmVSMCs) and aged human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) underwent Cfz, Met and Cfz+Met treatment and viability, metabolic flux and p53-LC3-B expression were measured. Experiments were recapitulated in AngII, CoCl2 and high-glucose stimulated HAoSMCs. RESULTS:Acutely, carfilzomib alone led to vascular hypo-contraction and increased ROS release. Subacutely, carfilzomib increased ROS release without vascular manifestations. Cfz+Met increased PGF2?-vasoconstriction and LC3-B-dependent autophagy in both young and aged mice. In vitro, Cfz+Met led to cytotoxicity and autophagy, while Met and Cfz+Met shifted cellular metabolism. CONCLUSION:Carfilzomib induces a transient vascular impairment and oxidative burst. Cfz+Met increased vascular contractility and synergistically induced autophagy in all settings. Therefore, carfilzomib cannot be accredited for a permanent vascular dysfunction, while Cfz+Met exert vasoprotective potency."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Influence of gene modification in biological behaviors and responses of mouse lung telocytes to inflammation.,"BACKGROUND:Telocytes play key roles in maintenance of organ/tissue function and prevention of organ injury. However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation. METHODS:Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS:Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line. CONCLUSION:We successfully constructed mouse lung telocyte cell-line which maintained the biological properties and behaviors as primary telocytes and could responses to inflammation induced by LPS. Thus, gene-modified lung telocytes, Telocyte Line, would provide a cell tool for researchers exploring the roles and applications of telocytes involved in physiological and pathological states in future."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Aberrant DNA methylation in rhabdomyosarcoma,"Many pediatric malignancies are embryonal in nature, and one hypothesis for the origin of embryonal tumors is that they arise from a defect in differentiation, either by an inability to terminally differentiate or a reversion to a pluripotent state. There is emerging evidence that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the transition from embryonic stem cell to a more committed cell fate, utilizing both de novo DNA methylation and poised ‘bivalent’ chromatin domains (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) to abolish pluripotency and gain lineage- and cell-type-specific characteristics as a cell differentiates. Thus inappropriate epigenetic silencing by aberrant DNA methylation of bivalent genes required for differentiation could lead to the uncontrolled cell growth observed in cancer. Our broad hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is targeted to a non-random subset of critical pathways used in normal development. This dysregulation of the normal epigenetic program used in development promotes cellular proliferation and provides a mechanism to block differentiation in pediatric cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma. Examination of DNA methylation in fourteen human rhabdomyosarcoma patient samples using RRBS. In addition, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation in one human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) forced to terminally differentiate by expression of the forced heterodimer MyoD~E12 (MDE). Lastly, RRBS was used to examine DNA methylation changes during normal differentiation in one primary human normal myoblast cell line"
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Selection of parasites with diminished drug susceptibility by amodiaquine-containing antimalarial regimens in Uganda.,"Amodiaquine (AQ) is paired with artesunate (AS) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in recommended antimalarial regimens. It is unclear how readily AQ resistance will be selected with combination chemotherapy.We collected 61 Plasmodium falciparum samples from a cohort of Ugandan children randomized for treatment with AQ-SP, AS-AQ, or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for uncomplicated malaria. In vitro susceptibility to monodesethylamodiaquine (MDAQ) was measured with a histidine-rich protein 2-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and potential resistance-mediating polymorphisms in pfmdr1 were evaluated.Parasites collected from patients treated with AQ-SP or AS-AQ within the prior 12 weeks were less susceptible to MDAQ (n = 18; mean of the median inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 62.9 nmol/L; range, 12.7-158.3 nmol/L) than were parasites from those not treated within 12 weeks (n = 43; mean IC(50), 37.5 nmol/L; range, 6.3-184.7 nmol/L; P=.009) or only from those patients in the treatment arm that did not receive AQ (n = 12; mean IC(50), 28.8 nmol/L; range, 6.3-121.8 nmol/L; P = .004). The proportion of strains with polymorphisms expected to mediate diminished response to AQ (pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y) increased after AQ therapy, although differences were not statistically significant.Prior therapy selected for diminished response to MDAQ, which suggests that AQ-containing regimens may rapidly lose efficacy in Africa. The mechanism of diminished MDAQ response is not fully explained by known mutations in pfmdr1."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Identification of soil bacteria susceptible to TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles.,"Because soil is expected to be a major sink for engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) released to the environment, the effects of ENPs on soil processes and the organisms that carry them out should be understood. DNA-based fingerprinting analyses have shown that ENPs alter soil bacterial communities, but specific taxon changes remain unknown. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to explore the responses of diverse bacterial taxa to two widely used ENPs, nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO, at various doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g(-1) soil for TiO(2); 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg g(-1) soil for ZnO) in incubated soil microcosms. These ENPs significantly altered the bacterial communities in a dose-dependent manner, with some taxa increasing as a proportion of the community, but more taxa decreasing, indicating that effects mostly reduced diversity. Some of the declining taxa are known to be associated with nitrogen fixation (Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Bradyrhizobium) and methane oxidation (Methylobacteriaceae), while some positively impacted taxa are known to be associated with the decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants (Sphingomonadaceae) and biopolymers including protein (Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces), indicating potential consequences to ecosystem-scale processes. The latter was suggested by a positive correlation between protease activity and the relative abundance of Streptomycetaceae (R = 0.49, P = 0.000) and Streptomyces (R = 0.47, P = 0.000). Our results demonstrate that some metal oxide nanoparticles could affect soil bacterial communities and associated processes through effects on susceptible, narrow-function bacterial taxa."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Real-time optotracing of curli and cellulose in live Salmonella biofilms using luminescent oligothiophenes.,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the protein- and polysaccharide-rich backbone of bacterial biofilms that provides a defensive barrier in clinical, environmental and industrial settings. Understanding the dynamics of biofilm formation in native environments has been hindered by a lack of research tools. Here we report a method for simultaneous, real-time, in situ detection and differentiation of the Salmonella ECM components curli and cellulose, using non-toxic, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs). These flexible conjugated polymers emit a conformation-dependent fluorescence spectrum, which we use to kinetically define extracellular appearance of curli fibres and cellulose polysaccharides during bacterial growth. The scope of this technique is demonstrated by defining biofilm morphotypes of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and their isogenic mutants in liquid culture and on solid media, and by visualising the ECM components in native biofilms. Our reported use of LCOs across a number of platforms, including intracellular cellulose production in eukaryotic cells and in infected tissues, demonstrates the versatility of this optotracing technology, and its ability to redefine biofilm research."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),The roots of plant defenses: integrative multivariate analyses uncover dynamic behaviors of gene and metabolic networks of roots elicited by leaf herbivory.,"High-throughput analyses have frequently been used to characterize herbivory-induced reconfigurations in plant primary and secondary metabolism in above- and below-ground tissues, but the conclusions drawn from these analyses are often limited by the univariate methods used to analyze the data. Here we use our previously described multivariate time-series data analysis to evaluate leaf herbivory-elicited transcriptional and metabolic dynamics in the roots of Nicotiana attenuata. We observed large, but transient, systemic responses in the roots that contrasted with the pattern of co-linearity observed in the up- and downregulation of genes and metabolites across the entire time series in treated and systemic leaves. Using this newly developed approach for the analysis of whole-plant molecular responses in a time-course multivariate data set, we simultaneously analyzed stress responses in leaves and roots in response to the elicitation of a leaf. We found that transient systemic responses in roots resolved into two principal trends characterized by: (i) an inversion of root-specific semi-diurnal (12 h) transcript oscillations and (ii) transcriptional changes with major amplitude effects that translated into a distinct suite of root-specific secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids synthesized in the roots of N. attenuata). These findings underscore the importance of understanding tissue-specific stress responses in the correct day-night phase context and provide a holistic framework for the important role played by roots in above-ground stress responses."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Impact of smoking on oncologic outcomes of upper tract urothelial carcinoma after radical nephroureterectomy.,"Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for developing upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).To assess the impact of cigarette smoking status, cumulative smoking exposure, and time from cessation on oncologic UTUC outcomes in patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).A total of 864 patients underwent RNU at five institutions. The median follow-up in this retrospective study was 50 mo. Smoking history included smoking status, quantity of cigarettes per day (CPD), duration in years, and years from smoking cessation. The cumulative smoking exposure was categorized as light-short-term (? 19 CPD and ? 19.9 yr), moderate (all combinations except light-short-term and heavy-long-term), and heavy-long-term (? 20 CPD and ? 20 yr).RNU with or without lymph node dissection. No patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and competing risk regression analyses assessed the effects of smoking on oncologic outcomes.A total of 244 patients (28.2%) never smoked; 297 (34.4%) and 323 (37.4%) were former and current smokers, respectively. Among smokers, 87 (10.1%), 331 (38.3%), and 202 (23.4%) were light-short-term, moderate, and heavy-long-term smokers, respectively. Current smoking status, smoking ? 20 CPD, ? 20 yr, and heavy-long-term smoking were associated with advanced disease (p values ? 0.004), greater likelihood of disease recurrence (p values ? 0.01), and cancer-specific mortality (p values ? 0.05) on multivariable analyses that adjusted for standard features. Patients who quit smoking ? 10 yr prior to RNU did not differ from never smokers regarding advanced tumor stages, disease recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality, but they had better oncologic outcomes then current smokers and those patients who quit smoking <10 yr prior to RNU. The study is limited by its retrospective nature.Cigarette smoking is significantly associated with advanced disease stages, disease recurrence, and cancer-specific mortality in patients treated with RNU for UTUC. Current smokers and those with a heavy and long-term smoking exposure have the highest risk for poor oncologic outcomes. Smoking cessation >10 yr prior to RNU seems to mitigate some detrimental effects. These results underscore the need for smoking cessation and prevention programs."

Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Transposase mediated construction of RNA-seq libraries.,"RNA-seq has been widely adopted as a gene-expression measurement tool due to the detail, resolution, and sensitivity of transcript characterization that the technique provides. Here we present two transposon-based methods that efficiently construct high-quality RNA-seq libraries. We first describe a method that creates RNA-seq libraries for Illumina sequencing from double-stranded cDNA with only two enzymatic reactions. We generated high-quality RNA-seq libraries from as little as 10 pg of mRNA (?1 ng of total RNA) with this approach. We also present a strand-specific RNA-seq library construction protocol that combines transposon-based library construction with uracil DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII to specifically degrade the second strand constructed during cDNA synthesis. The directional RNA-seq libraries maintain the same quality as the nondirectional libraries, while showing a high degree of strand specificity, such that 99.5% of reads map to the expected genomic strand. Each transposon-based library construction method performed well when compared with standard RNA-seq library construction methods with regard to complexity of the libraries, correlation between biological replicates, and the percentage of reads that align to the genome as well as exons. Our results show that high-quality RNA-seq libraries can be constructed efficiently and in an automatable fashion using transposition technology."
Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI),Regions of variable DNA methylation in human placenta associated with newborn neurobehavior.,"The placenta regulates the in utero environment and functionally impacts fetal development. Candidate gene studies identified variation in placental DNA methylation is associated with newborn neurologic and behavioral outcomes including movement quality, lethargic behavior, attention, and arousal. We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P < 1.8 × 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes."

Qiita,Chagas disease microbiome,"Trypanosoma cruzi causes cardiac and digestive manifestations.  Moreover, an association with digestive symptom severity and diet has been postulated.  T. cruzi infects and persists in intestinal tissues, but the impact of T. cruzi infection on the gut microbiome has yet to be characterized.The goal of this study is to determine changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome associated with T. cruzi intestinal parasite burden.

We study Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Chagas Disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) by the NIH and WHO. This is because it primarily affects the rural poor in resource poor areas. There is therefore no economic incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to be involved in research or therapeutic development. Our goal is to understand the factors that determine infection outcome, disease progression and response to therapy. Symptomatic Chagas disease is associated with cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure, alone or in combination with megacolon and megaoesophagus. Over five million people are currently infected, with a mortality rate of 12,000/year. This parasite is endemic to Latin America, where 13% of the population is at risk of infection. In addition, there are up to a million T. cruzi-infected individuals in the United States, a large number of which live in Southern California. Most of these cases are due to emigration of infected individuals, but autochthonous transmission has also been reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and California."
Qiita,"Host biology, ecology and the environment influence microbial biomass and diversity in 101 marine fish species","Fish are the most diverse and widely distributed vertebrates, yet little is known about the microbial ecology of fishes nor the biological and environmental factors that influence fish microbiota. To identify factors that explain microbial diversity patterns in a geographical subset of marine fish, we analyzed the microbiota (gill tissue, skin mucus, midgut digesta and hindgut digesta) from 101 species of Southern California marine fishes, spanning 22 orders, 55 families and 83 genera, representing ~25% of local marine fish diversity. We compare alpha, beta and gamma diversity while establishing a method to estimate microbial biomass associated with these host surfaces. We show that body site is the strongest driver of microbial diversity while microbial biomass and diversity is lowest in the gill of larger, pelagic fishes. Patterns of phylosymbiosis are observed across the gill, skin and hindgut. In a quantitative synthesis of vertebrate hindguts (569 species), we also show that mammals have the highest gamma diversity when controlling for host species number while fishes have the highest percent of unique microbial taxa. The composite dataset will be useful to vertebrate microbiota researchers and fish biologists interested in microbial ecology, with applications in aquaculture and fisheries management."
Qiita,The Screamer Gut Microbiome,"The horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) is a member of Anhimidae family (Anseriformes order), with two species more (southern screamer (Chauna chavaria) and the northern screamer (Chauna torquata). Horned screamers are distributed in tropical lowland fresh water of Venezuela, the eastern llanos of Columbia, eastern Bolivia and south-central Brazil (Naranjo 1986; Piland, 2010).  This species is catalog by IUCN as Least Concern (LC), because has a large range distribution, and population decline is not to be sufficiently rapid (BirdLife International, 2012). One study in Ecuador report that agriculture expansion and cattle ranching are reduced the Horned Screamer population (Avala et al., 2009). The natural habitat of Venezuela had been destroyed by agriculture and livestock grazing expansion causing loss of biodiversity (Fundación La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, 2010). However information about this bird is reduced to a few studies realized in Colombia and Ecuador (Gill et al., 1974; Barrow et al 1986; Naranjo, 1986; Avala et al., 2009) and in Venezuela information is reduce a few counts reported by NWC (Martinez, 2011, 2012; Sainz-Borgo, 2013; Sainz-Borgo et al., 2014, 2015). The Horned Screamer eats a variety of small shrubs and buds grazing and digging along the water (Naranjo, 1986; Piland, 2010; Hilty, 2013). Only one study made in Colombia described the horned screamer diet as herbivorous and include 9 plant species (Naranjo, 1986). However, we not found reports of bacteria community or anatomy description of digestive tract in horned screamer. We hypothesized that horned screamer can be have a digestive tract with fermentation chamber with microorganisms in crop or ceca. The objective of our study is describe the anatomy and to characterize the bacterial community of digestive tract of horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) in a wetland of Venezuela. "

Qiita,Brazelton LostCity chimney biofilm,"The Lost City Hydrothermal Field, an ultramafic-hosted system located 15 km west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has experienced at least 30,000 years of hydrothermal activity. Previous studies have shown that its carbonate chimneys form by mixing of round 90C, pH 9-11 hydrothermal fluids and cold seawater. Flow of methane and hydrogen-rich hydrothermal fluids in the porous interior chimney walls supports an archaeal biofilm dominated by a single phylotype of Methanosarcinales. We have  a collection of 40 carbonate chimney samples, most of which have been dated with uranium-thorium isotopic systematics.  The resulting ages range from 34 to 145,000 years. Previous 16S rRNA pyrotag sequencing of 4 of these samples revealed that rare sequences in young chimneys were often more abundant in older chimneys, indicating that species can remain rare in a chimney for >100 years before blooming and becoming dominant when the environmental conditions allow. These results suggest that a long history of selection over many cycles of chimney growth has resulted in numerous closely related species at Lost City, each of which is pre-adapted to a particular set of re-occurring environmental conditions. Due to the unique characteristics of the Lost City Hydrothermal Field, these data offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of a microbial ecosystem's rare biosphere over thousands of years."

Qiita,Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities and metagenomes in an upland Alaskan boreal forest.,"Permafrost soils are large reservoirs of potentially labile carbon (C). Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG-CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1 m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbial community members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimately reduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle."
Qiita,Patterns in gut microbiota similarity associated with degree of sociality among sex classes of a Neotropical primate.,"Studies of human and domestic animal models indicate that related individuals and those that spend the most time in physical contact typically have more similar gut microbial communities. However, few studies have examined these factors in wild mammals where complex social dynamics and a variety of interacting environmental factors may impact the patterns observed in controlled systems. Here, we explore the effect of host kinship and time spent in social contact on the gut microbiota of wild, black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). Our results indicate that closely related individuals had less similar gut microbial communities than non-related individuals. However, the effect was small. In contrast, as previously reported in baboons and chimpanzees, individuals that spent more time in contact (0 m) and close proximity (0-1 m) had more similar gut microbial communities. This pattern was driven by adult female-adult female dyads, which generally spend more time in social contact than adult male-adult male dyads or adult male-adult female dyads. Relative abundances of individual microbial genera such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus were also more similar in individuals that spent more time in contact or close proximity. Overall, our data suggest that even in arboreal primates that live in small social groups and spend a relatively low proportion of their time in physical contact, social interactions are associated with variation in gut microbiota composition. Additionally, these results demonstrate that within a given host species, subgroups of individuals may interact with the gut microbiota differently."
Qiita,Assessing saliva microbiome collection and processing methods,"The oral microbiome has been connected with lung health and may be of significance in the progression of SARS-CoV2 infection. Saliva-based SARS-CoV2 tests provide the opportunity to leverage stored samples for assessing the oral microbiome. However, these collection kits have not been tested for accuracy of measuring the oral microbiome. Saliva is highly enriched with human DNA and reducing it prior to shotgun sequencing may increase the depth of bacterial reads. We examined both the effect of saliva collection method and sequence processing on measurement of microbiome depth and diversity by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We collected 56 samples from 22 subjects. Each subject provided two saliva samples with and without preservative; six subjects provided a second set of samples the following day. 16S rRNA gene (V4) sequencing was performed on all samples, and shotgun metagenomics was performed on eight samples collected with preservative with and without human DNA depletion before sequencing. We observed that the beta diversity distances within subjects over time was smaller than between unrelated subjects, and distances within subjects were smaller in samples collected with preservative. Samples collected with preservative had higher alpha diversity measuring both richness and evenness. Human DNA depletion before extraction and shotgun sequencing yielded higher total and relative reads mapping to bacterial sequences. We conclude that collecting saliva with preservative may give more consistent measures of the oral microbiome and depleting human DNA increases yield of bacterial sequences. "

Qiita,Biological oxygen demand optode analysis of coral reef-associated microbial communities exposed to algal exudates.,"Coral competition with benthic algae has been shown to alter the bacterial communities associated with the coral. Certain groups of algae lead to an increase in potential pathogens, potentially shifting the competitive advantage away from the coral and to the alga, while others do not. Here we investigate the changes in the viral communities associated with corals competing with different types of benthic algae to determine if similar changes occur in the viral component of the coral holobiont. We expect that algae that cause stress to corals will lead to the induction of eukaryotic viruses (e.g. infecting coral and/or zooxanthellae) and pathogen-associated phage, while algae that are inferior competitors to corals will not."
Qiita,The effect of diet on the human gut microbiome: a metagenomic analysis in humanized gnotobiotic mice - assembly,"Diet and nutritional status are among the most important modifiable determinants of human health. The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by a persons gut microbial community (microbiota) and its component genes (microbiome). Unraveling the interrelations among diet, the structure and operations of the gut microbiota, and nutrient and energy harvest is confounded by variations in human environmental exposures, microbial ecology, and genotype. To help overcome these problems, we created a well-defined, representative animal model of the human gut ecosystem by transplanting fresh or frozen adult human fecal microbial communities into germ-free C57BL/6J mice. Culture-independent metagenomic analysis of the temporal, spatial, and intergenerational patterns of bacterial colonization showed that these humanized mice were stably and heritably colonized and reproduced much of the bacterial diversity of the donors microbiota. Switching from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet to a high-fat, high-sugar Western diet shifted the structure of the microbiota within a single day, changed the representation of metabolic pathways in the microbiome, and altered microbiome gene expression. Reciprocal transplants involving various combinations of donor and recipient diets revealed that colonization history influences the initial structure of the microbial community but that these effects can be rapidly altered by diet. Humanized mice fed the Western diet have increased adiposity; this trait is transmissible via microbiota transplantation. Humanized gnotobiotic mice will be useful for conducting proof-of-principle clinical trials that test the effects of environmental and genetic factors on the gut microbiota and host physiology. Nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers GQ491120 to GQ493997."
Qiita,Rapid change of fecal microbiome and disappearance of Clostridium difficile in a colonized infant after transition from breast milk to cow milk,"Background
Clostridium difficile is the most common known cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Upon the disturbance of gut microbiota by antibiotics, C. difficile establishes growth and releases toxins A and B, which cause tissue damage in the host. The symptoms of C. difficile infection disease range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Interestingly, 10–50 % of infants are asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile. This longitudinal study of the C. difficile colonization in an infant revealed the dynamics of C. difficile presence in gut microbiota.

Methods
Fifty fecal samples, collected weekly between 5.5 and 17 months of age from a female infant who was an asymptomatic carrier of C. difficile, were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results
Colonization switching between toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. difficile strains as well as more than 100,000-fold fluctuations of C. difficile counts were observed. C. difficile toxins were detected during the testing period in some infant stool samples, but the infant never had diarrhea. Although fecal microbiota was stable during breast feeding, a dramatic and permanent change of microbiota composition was observed within 5 days of the transition from human milk to cow milk. A rapid decline and eventual disappearance of C. difficile coincided with weaning at 12.5 months. An increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Parabacteroides spp., Coprococcus spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Oscillospira spp. and a decrease of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Escherichia spp., and Clostridium spp. were observed during weaning. The change in microbiome composition was accompanied by a gradual increase of fecal pH from 5.5 to 7.

Conclusions
The bacterial groups that are less abundant in early infancy, and that increase in relative abundance after weaning, likely are responsible for the expulsion of C. difficile."
Qiita,Plot-scale manipulations of organic matter inputs to soils correlate with shifts in microbial community composition in a lowland tropical rain forest,"Little is known about the organisms responsible for decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, or how variations in their relative abundance may influence soil carbon (C) cycling. Here, we altered organic matter in situ by manipulating both litter and through fall inputs to tropical rainforest soils, and then used QPCR and error-corrected bar coded pyrosequencing to investigate how the resulting changes in biogeochemical properties affected microbial community structure. The plot-scale manipulations drove significant changes in microbial community composition: Acidobacteria were present in greater relative abundance in litter removal plots than in double litter plots, while Alphaproteobacteria were found in higher relative abundance in double litter and throughfall reduction plots than in control or litter removal plots. In addition, the bacterial:archaeal ratio was higher in double litter than no litter plots. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated with microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N), and soil N and C pools, while acidobacterial relative abundance was negatively correlated with these same factors. Bacterial:archaeal ratios were positively correlated with soil moisture, total soil C and N, extractable ammonium pools, and soil C:N ratios. Additionally, bacterial:archaeal ratios were positively related to the relative abundance of Actinobateria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and negatively correlated to the relative abundance of Nitrospira and Acidobacteria. Together, our results support the copiotrophic/oligotrophic model of soil heterotrophic microbes suggested by Fierer et al. (2007). Our work also provides new insight into the role of Archaea, and suggests that the majority of Archaea in this tropical rainforest soil may be autotrophic nitrifiers which have a selective advantage when soil C:N ratios are low."
Qiita,Bacterial density rather than diversity correlates with hatching success across different avian species,"Bacterial communities within avian nests are considered an important determinant of egg viability, potentially selecting for traits that confer embryos with protection against trans-shell infection. A high bacterial density on the eggshell increases hatching failure, whether this effect could be due to changes in bacterial community or just a general increase in bacterial density. We explored this idea using intra- and interspecific comparisons of the relationship between hatching success and eggshell bacteria characterized by culture and molecular techniques (fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing). We collected information for 152 nests belonging to 17 bird species. Hatching failures occurred more frequently in nests with higher density of aerobic mesophilic bacteria on their eggshells. Bacterial community was also related to hatching success, but only when minority bacterial operational taxonomic units were considered. These findings support the hypothesis that bacterial density is a selective agent of embryo viability, and hence a proxy of hatching failure only within species. Although different avian species hold different bacterial densities or assemblages on their eggs, the association between bacteria and hatching success was similar for different species. This result suggests that interspecific differences in antibacterial defenses are responsible for keeping the hatching success at similar levels in different species."

We are comparing the gut microbiota of the wax moth under wax and plastic diets."
Qiita,A microbial clock provides an accurate estimate of the postmortem interval in a mouse model system - 18S,"Establishing the time since death or postmortem interval (PMI) is critical in the initial stages of death investigations, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of errors and biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess PMI, but errors can range on the scale of days, weeks or season depending on the scenario1. Limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and initial egg deposition2, lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons3, and regionally specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities4. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that might avoid many of these limitations, because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. However, the feasibility of using microbes forensically has yet to be rigorously tested, and we must determine whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate predictions.  Here, we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing estimates of PMI to within ~3 days over 48 days, and provide insight into the ecological factors underlying succession of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes within the decomposing corpse system. Our results suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI."
Qiita,Molecular cartography of the human skin surface in 3D,"The human skin is an organ with a surface area of 1.5-2 m(2) that provides our interface with the environment. The molecular composition of this organ is derived from host cells, microbiota, and external molecules. The chemical makeup of the skin surface is largely undefined. Here we advance the technologies needed to explore the topographical distribution of skin molecules, using 3D mapping of mass spectrometry data and microbial 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Our 3D maps reveal that the molecular composition of skin has diverse distributions and that the composition is defined not only by skin cells and microbes but also by our daily routines, including the application of hygiene products. The technological development of these maps lays a foundation for studying the spatial relationships of human skin with hygiene, the microbiota, and environment, with potential for developing predictive models of skin phenotypes tailored to individual health."

Qiita,Coinfection and infection duration shape how pathogens affect the African buffalo gut microbiota,"Changes in the gut microbiota during pathogen infection are often predicted to influence disease outcomes. However, studies exploring whether pathogens induce microbiota shifts have yielded inconsistent results. This suggests that variation in infection, rather than the presence of infection alone, might shape pathogen–microbiota relationships. For example, most hosts are coinfected with multiple pathogens simultaneously, and hosts vary in how long they are infected, which may amplify or diminish microbial shifts expected in response to a focal pathogen. We used a longitudinal anthelmintic treatment study of free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to examine whether (i) coinfection with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis, TB) and gastrointestinal nematodes, and (ii) the duration of TB infection, modified effects of single pathogens on the gut microbiota. By accounting for the interaction between TB and nematodes, we found that coinfection affected changes in microbial abundance associated with single infections. Furthermore, the duration of TB infection predicted more microbiota variation than the presence of TB. Importantly, coinfection and infection duration had nearly as much influence on microbial patterns as demographic and environmental factors commonly examined in microbiota research. These findings demonstrate that acknowledging infection heterogeneities may be crucial to understanding relationships between pathogens and the gut microbiota."
Qiita,Large-scale replicated field study of maize rhizosphere identifies heritable microbes,"Soil microbes that colonize plant roots and are responsive to differences in plant genotype remain to be ascertained for agronomically important crops. From a very large-scale longitudinal field study of 27 maize inbred lines planted in three fields, with partial replication 5 y later, we identify root-associated microbiota exhibiting reproducible associations with plant genotype. Analysis of 4,866 samples identified 143 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) whose variation in relative abundances across the samples was significantly regulated by plant genotype, and included five of seven core OTUs present in all samples. Plant genetic effects were significant amid the large effects of plant age on the rhizosphere microbiome, regardless of the specific community of each field, and despite microbiome responses to climate events. Seasonal patterns showed that the plant root microbiome is locally seeded, changes with plant growth, and responds to weather events. However, against this background of variation, specific taxa responded to differences in host genotype. If shown to have beneficial functions, microbes may be considered candidate traits for selective breeding."
ReframeDB,Growth-based high throughput screening of small molecule libraries against anaerobic microbial choline metabolism,"Phenotypic screening looking for growth inhibitors of E. coli when it‚Äôs cultured in minimal media containing choline as carbon source, but that don‚Äôt inhibit growth on glycerol as carbon source. Bacterial growth is the indirect phenotypic signal of TMA inhibition, which will be subsequently evaluated using a LC/MS method.
Purpose
A prevalent number of bacterial species that inhabit the human gut can utilize the dietary nutrient choline as a source of carbon and energy, while releasing trimethylamine (TMA) as a byproduct. More specifically, the cut gene cluster that contains the genes that code for choline-TMA lyase (CutC) and its activating enzyme (CutD) are responsible to cleaving choline into acetaldehyde and TMA. The former can be used as source of energy via fermentation, whereas the latter is a byproduct of this metabolism. TMA, however, gets excreted out of the human body through the liver, where it gets oxidized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMAO has a profound effect on the host's physiology, including the onset of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes. Furthermore, the cut gene cluster is found in a prevalent number of gut commensal bacteria, which emphasizes the need to specifically target this microbial pathway. This assay, which is based on a phenotypic high throughput screening, will reveal compounds that interfere with the microbial choline utilization and its transformation into TMA by inhibiting the growth of bacteria when choline is the sole carbon-energy source.
Protocol
384-well plates will be filled with compounds previously dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 uM. Columns 1 to 22 are the experimental wells. Columns 23 and 24 are controls, containing 60 ug/mL kanamycin, and DMSO, respectively. Each compound will be screened in singlicate. Once we obtain the plates, they will be left to equilibrate in the anaerobic chamber overnight. Next, we will add 50 uL of previously reduced NCE (non-carbon essential) media containing 20 mM choline and inoculate with E. coli MS-200-1 to an initial OD600 ~ 0.1. We will measure OD600 after 7 and 20 h of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees Celsius. The compounds that inhibit growth on choline (Z-score =<-2) will be re-tested at the same concentration but in NCE media containing 2.5 g/l glycerol (as counter-screening). Those compounds that don't inhibit growth under this condition (Z-score >= 0) will be picked for dose response against TMA generation.

ReframeDB,hRSV High Throughput Screen,"The high throughput cell-based HTS-system based on recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus type A GFP reporter virus (hRSV-A_GFP) identifies anti-hRSV compounds. HRSV is a major cause for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Purpose
hRSV is a globally distributed viral pathogen causing respiratory disease in humans.
The high throughput cell-based HTS-system employs a recombinant hRSV-A strain encoding GFP fluorescent protein as reporter. Since the GFP gene is an integral part of the modified RSV genome, GFP fluorescence reflects efficiency of RSV infection and replication. A human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) is infected with hRSV-A_GFP viruses in presence of test compounds. Subsequently, GFP-fluorescence is quantified. The intensity of GFP fluorescence reflects RSV infection efficiency and is used as a marker to quantify antiviral efficacy of test compounds. In parallel, cell viability is examined by use of an MTT test. The MTT test examines metabolic activity of cultured cells. This information is used to distinguish between compounds with antiviral activity and cytotoxic molecules which destroy cells and therefore indirectly inhibit virus infection.
Protocol
HEp-2 cells are seeded in a clear bottom 384-well plates. Compounds are added together with the virus (MOI 0.5) 24h post seeding. Synagis, an antibody against the pre-fusion hRSV F-protein, is used as an inhibitory control and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control.

Purpose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, exists in a complex set of environments both intracellularly and extracellularly in the host. Most drug screening for tuberculosis has been performed on extracellular bacteria. We are screening for drugs that inhibit M. tuberculosis growth inside macrophages, a primary cell type in which the bacteria reside. This is a high-content image-based assay. Total fluorescence intensity of DsRed-producing M. tuberculosis and nucleic acid-stained macrophages are readouts of growth or survival.
Protocol
RAW 264.7 cells are propagated in RMPI ( RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2 mM Glutagro, 1 mM sodium pyruvate medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 37Â°C, 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells are infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Rv DREAM8 strain which constitutively expresses DsRed) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 overnight. Compounds are diluted in RPMI-1640, 5% FBS with Glutagro and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Infected RAW 264.7 cells are harvested with Accumax solution, washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacilli and resuspended in RPMI-1640 with Glutagro and sodium pyruvate (no FBS). Infected cells are  seeded in 384-well plates containing compounds at 3.3 x 10^3 cells per well, resulting in a final assay concentration of 2.5% FBS. After a 72 hour incubation period, SYBR Green I dye is diluted in PBS and added to a final concentration of 5x to stain macrophage nuclei. Cells are imaged on an ImageXpress Micro with a 4x objective. Macrophage nuclei are imaged using a FITC filter set and M. tuberculosis are imaged using a Texas Red filter set.

Purpose
COVID-19 C3-like protease is a cystine protease with a chemotrypsin-like fold crucial to the replication of novel coronavirus COVID-19. The virus, COVID-19 has a single stranded RNA genome which is transcribed as a single polypeptide, which COVID-19 C3-like protease then cleaves into individual protein products. Inhibitors of this protease should be effective inhibitors of the viral life cycle. By screening against the recombinant enzyme we are able to find effective starting points to transfer to more complex, lower throughput viral replication assays. This assay is also a useful counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 target PLPro as they are both cystine proteases but share no similarity in their active sites.

Purpose
Diabetes is a polygenetic and chronic disease affecting approximately 346 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled diabetes results in hyperglycemia, which overtime leads to serious damages to many organs. More than 90% diabetic population have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The classic pathogenesis of T2DM involves insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, marked by impaired glucose stimulated insulin section. Only 40-50% of individuals with insulin resistance progress to T2DM. The pivotal defect in those who progress is that pancreatic beta cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance, become dysfunctional and eventually die. Thus, pancreatic beta cell dysfunction is a key step in the progression from metabolic impairments to a disease state. 
Protocol
Briefly, EndobetaC cells, a human pancreatic beta cell line, were labelled with nano-luciferase. EndobetaC nano-Luc cells were plated on 384-well plate and treated with compound plus 2 mM palmitate for 72 hours. After washing, the cells will be treated with 2 mM and 20 mM glucose respectively. The supernatant will be used for luciferase-based assay.

Purpose
We aim to screen the hit compounds from the primary screen (done previously) to identify the false positives. For this purpose, cytotoxicity assay will be used as the deselection assay. The screen will be carried out in Aedes albopictus U4.4 cells (Argo knockout) expressing DENV1 replicon with a Nanoluciferase based reporter. The U4.4-DENV1 replicon cell line has been stably and successfully maintained for over 30 passages without significant loss of reporter signal. Screen will be done on a 384-well plate using cryopreserved cells, frozen at the same passage. This will save time on culturing cells throughout the screen and will reduce any variations that may be caused due to different cell passages. Fluorescent signal generated by conversion of Resazurin to resoflurin will be used as the measure of viability of the cells.
Toxicity assay will be carried out as a dose response screen after the primary single point viral inhibition screen.

Purpose
Balamuthia mandrillaris is an opportunistic pathogen, generally entering through broken skin or through the respiratory pathway, where it can cause lesions. Infection of the brain is thought to occur secondarily from these sites after penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and can cause GAE with a mortality rate up to 95%. In our screen we incubated the B. mandrillaris trophozoites with the compounds for 72 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the neutral control, DMSO.
Protocol
The compounds were screened against Balamuthia mandrillaris following an ATP-bioluminescence based assay for cell growth and survival. For 8-point dose response study, 30 uL of B. mandrillaris (3,000 trophozoites) were added to plated compounds to yield final concentrations spanning from 0.26 uM - 33 uM. Negative controls in the screen plates contained 0.5% DMSO. Assay plates were incubated for 72 h at 37?C B. mandrillaris and at the end of incubation 20 uL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were added in each well of the 96-well plates to induce cell lysis.

Purpose
This high content imaging, cell-based assay has been developed to identify anti-wolbachial compounds. Wolbachia is an endosymbiont of parasitic filarial nematodes, including ones that infect humans, such as Onchocerca volvulus (which causes onchocerciasis, aka. river blindness), and Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp. (which cause lymphatic filariasis, aka. elephantiasis). Without Wolbachia the long-lived (up to 15 years) adult worms become sterile and eventually die. Wolbachia bacteria also infect insect cells, and this assay uses the LDW1 Drosophila cell line, naturally infected with Wolbachia strain wMel. This is the first HCI assay to specifically label Wolbachia, one of the largest screening efforts to date, and the first anti-wolbachial assays in 1536-well format.

ReframeDB,COVID-19 Nsp16 2â€™-O-methyltransferase counterscreen assay,"Secondary counterscreen assay for Nsp16 methyltransferase hits will utilize a commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay (MTase-Glo, Promega).
Purpose
A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay kit (MTase-Glo, Promega) was utilized to measure methyltransferase activity for the ReFRAME primary screen. Nsp16 activity requires S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to act as the methyl donor, converting it to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) as it is consumed. At assay termination, a series of kit provided coupled reactions converts SAH to light: the SAH reaction product is converted to adenosine by SAH-hydrolase; then to AMP by adenosine kinase; then to ADP by polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase; then to ATP by pyruvate kinase. Finally, luciferase converts ATP to light, which is detected on a luminometer. These subsequent coupled reactions have the potential to be inhibited and picked up as false hits in the primary screen. Therefore, a counterscreen will be performed by omitting nsp16 from the reaction mix and replacing with SAH to simulate completed methyltransferase reaction conditions, and proceeding with the coupled reactions in the presence of drugs. Any inhibition observed would be indicative of off-target activity and/or false hits. 
Protocol
In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 500 nM SAH in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT is incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr in the presence of MTase-GloTM reagent.

ReframeDB,Screening for PLD3 enzyme inhibitors,"PLD3 and PLD4 are endolysosomal exonucleases that appear to behave as negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing. Inhibitors may be useful as immunological adjuvants for vaccine or cancer applications.
Purpose
The screen we have developed has been assessed using the LOPAC library. Our assay relies on the exonuclease activity of PLD3 and PLD4. A short oligonucleotide carrying a fluorescein adduct on one base along with a fluorescence quencher (Iowa Black) on the 3 prime end emits enhanced fluorescence upon digestion by PLD3 or PLD4. Inhibitors will suppress this signal. We plan to introduce into plates that are pre-dotted with compounds to be screened a buffer containing enzyme but no substrate. After a 15 min room temperature incubation, the substrate will be added in an equal volume of butter and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37oC. FITC fluorescence is then read. We propose to use PLD3 at 2 nM, PLD4 at 100 nM, and substrate at 2 uM. Final concentration of the ReFrame compound inhibitors will be 2 uM. 
Protocol
Clear 384-well plates are spotted with 10 nl compounds (final conc 2 uM). Then 5 ul enzyme in 1X buffer is added and the plates pre-incubated with compunds for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 5 ul 1X buffer containing fluorogenic substrate (4 uM) is added, and cultured at 37oC for 2 h. One copy of the spotted library will be incubated with 2 uM PLD3, substrate and its optimal buffer. A second copy of the spotted library will be incubated with PLD4, substrate along with its buffer.

VDJServer,Single-Cell Map of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast Tumor Microenvironment,"Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

VDJServer,B cells populating the multiple sclerosis brain mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by autoimmune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration. The CNS of patients with MS harbors expanded clones of antigen-experienced B cells that reside in distinct compartments including the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and parenchyma. It is not understood whether this immune infiltrate initiates its development in the CNS or in peripheral tissues. B cells in the CSF can exchange with those in peripheral blood, implying that CNS B cells may have access to lymphoid tissue that may be the specific compartment(s) in which CNS-resident B cells encounter antigen and experience affinity maturation. Paired tissues were used to determine whether the B cells that populate the CNS mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). High-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire demonstrated that clonally expanded B cells were present in both compartments. Founding members of clones were more often found in the draining CLNs. More mature clonal members derived from these founders were observed in the draining CLNs and also in the CNS, including lesions. These data provide new evidence that B cells traffic freely across the tissue barrier, with the majority of B cell maturation occurring outside of the CNS in the secondary lymphoid tissue. Our study may aid in further defining the mechanisms of immunomodulatory therapies that either deplete circulating B cells or affect the intrathecal B cell compartment by inhibiting lymphocyte transmigration into the CNS.

VDJServer,Hierarchical Clustering Can Identify B Cell Clones With High Confidence in Ig Repertoire Sequencing Data,"Adaptive immunity is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. Each clone is the progeny of a single B cell responding to Ag, with diversified Ig receptors. These receptors can now be profiled on a large scale by next-generation sequencing. Such data provide a window into the microevolutionary dynamics that drive successful immune responses and the dysregulation that occurs with aging or disease. Clonal relationships are not directly measured, but they must be computationally inferred from these sequencing data. Although several hierarchical clustering-based methods have been proposed, they vary in distance and linkage methods and have not yet been rigorously compared. In this study, we use a combination of human experimental and simulated data to characterize the performance of hierarchical clustering-based methods for partitioning sequences into clones. We find that single linkage clustering has high performance, with specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value all >99%, whereas other linkages result in a significant loss of sensitivity. Surprisingly, distance metrics that incorporate the biases of somatic hypermutation do not outperform simple Hamming distance. Although errors were more likely in sequences with short junctions, using the entire dataset to choose a single distance threshold for clustering is near optimal. Our results suggest that hierarchical clustering using single linkage with Hamming distance identifies clones with high confidence and provides a fully automated method for clonal grouping. The performance estimates we develop provide important context to interpret clonal analysis of repertoire sequencing data and allow for rigorous testing of other clonal grouping algorithms.

Zenodo,Data from: The relative power of genome scans to detect local adaptation depends on sampling design and statistical method,"Although genome scans have become a popular approach towards understanding the genetic basis of local adaptation, the field still does not have a firm grasp on how sampling design and demographic history affect the performance of genome scans on complex landscapes. To explore these issues, we compared 20 different sampling designs in equilibrium (i.e. island model and isolation by distance) and nonequilibrium (i.e. range expansion from one or two refugia) demographic histories in spatially heterogeneous environments. We simulated spatially complex landscapes, which allowed us to exploit local maxima and minima in the environment in 'pair' and 'transect' sampling strategies. We compared FST outlier and genetic–environment association (GEA) methods for each of two approaches that control for population structure: with a covariance matrix or with latent factors. We show that while the relative power of two methods in the same category (FST or GEA) depended largely on the number of individuals sampled, overall GEA tests had higher power in the island model and FST had higher power under isolation by distance. In the refugia models, however, these methods varied in their power to detect local adaptation at weakly selected loci. At weakly selected loci, paired sampling designs had equal or higher power than transect or random designs to detect local adaptation. Our results can inform sampling designs for studies of local adaptation and have important implications for the interpretation of genome scans based on landscape data."

Zenodo,Data from: 2-D sex images elicit mate copying in fruit flies,"Although the environment is three-dimensional (3-D), humans are able to extract subtle information from two-dimensional (2-D) images, particularly in the domain of sex. However, whether animals with simpler nervous systems are capable of such information extraction remains to be demonstrated, as this ability would suggest a functional generalisation capacity. Here, we performed mate-copying experiments in Drosophila melanogaster using 2-D artificial stimuli. Mate copying occurs when naïve females observe the mating success of potential mates and use that social information to build their own mating preference. By replacing live demonstrations with (i) photos or (ii) simplified images of copulating pairs, we found that even crudely simplified images of sexual intercourse still elicit mate copying, suggesting that Drosophila is able to extract sex-related information even from a degraded image. This new method constitutes a powerful tool to further investigate mate copying in that species and sexual preferences in general."
Zenodo,Memory extinction and spontaneous recovery shaping parasitoid foraging behavior,"Animals can alter their foraging behavior through associative learning, where an encounter with an essential resource (e.g. food or a reproductive opportunity) is associated with nearby environmental cues (e.g. volatiles). This can subsequently improve the animal's foraging efficiency. However, when these associated cues are encountered again, the anticipated resource is not always present. Such an unrewarding experience, also called a memory-extinction experience, can change an animal's response to the associated cues. Although some studies are available on the mechanisms of this process, they rarely focus on cues and rewards that are relevant in an animal's natural habitat. In this study, we tested the effect of different types of ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences on the conditioned plant volatile preferences of the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata that uses these cues to locate its caterpillar hosts. These extinction experiences consisted of contact with only host traces (frass and silk), contact with non-host traces or an oviposition in a non-host near host traces, on the conditioned plant species. Our results show that the lack of an oviposition, after contacting host traces, led to the temporary alteration of the conditioned plant volatile preference in C. glomerata, but this effect was plant species-specific. These results provide novel insights in how ecologically relevant memory-extinction experiences can fine-tune an animal's foraging behavior. This fine-tuning of learned behavior can be beneficial when the lack of finding a resource accurately predicts current, but not future foraging opportunities. Such continuous re-evaluation of obtained information helps animals to prevent maladaptive foraging behavior."

Zenodo,Data from: Drivers of individual niche variation in coexisting species,"1. Although neglected by classic niche theory, individual variation is now recognized as a prevalent phenomenon in nature with evolutionary and ecological relevance. Recent theory suggests that differences in individual variation across competitors can affect species coexistence and community patterns. However, the degree of individual variation is flexible across wild populations and we still know little about the ecological drivers of this variation across populations of single species and, especially, across coexisting species. 2. Here we aimed to (i) elucidate the major drivers of individual niche variation in natural communities and (ii) to determine how consistent this variation is across coexisting species and communities.
3. We analyzed natural patterns of individual-level niche variation in four species of coexisting generalist frogs across a wide range of tropical communities. Specifically, we used gut contents and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) from frog species and their prey to quantify individual niche specialization. Then we combined data on local community structure, availability of prey, phylogenetic relationships, and predator-prey size models to test how this variation is related to four ecological factors which are predicted to be key drivers of individual specialization: intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, ecological opportunity (i.e., diversity of resources), and predation. 4. We found that the degree of individual trophic specialization varied by up to nine-fold across populations within the same species. This sizable variation in trophic specialization across populations was at least partially explained by gradients of density of competitors (both conspecifics and heterospecifics) and intraguild predation. However, the specific relationships between individual specialization and these ecological gradients were strongly species-specific. As consequences, the identity of the species with more individual variation changed among sites and there was typically no spatial correlation in the degree of individual specialization across co-existing species. 5. Our results show that individual niche specialization within and across species can be strongly context-dependent and that hierarchies of individual variation among coexisting species are not necessarily consistent across communities. Recent theory suggests that this pattern could lead to concurrent changes in competitive interactions across sites and thereby could play a key role in species coexistence at the landscape level. Our results suggest that individual variation across and within coexisting species has the potential to affect not only species coexistence at local communities, but also regional diversity patterns."

Zenodo,Mating under climate change: impact of simulated heatwaves on the reproduction of model pollinators (Dataset),"
Climate change is related to an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as heatwaves. It is well established that such events may worsen the current worldwide biodiversity decline. In many organisms, heat stress is associated with direct physiological perturbations and could lead to a decrease of fitness. In contrast to endotherms, heat stress resistance has been poorly investigated in heterotherms; especially in insects, in which the internal physiological mechanisms available to regulate body temperature are almost negligible making them sensitive to extreme temperature variations.
Wild bees are crucial pollinators for wild plants and crops. Among them, bumblebees are experiencing a strong decline across the world. Therefore, the ongoing global decline of these insect pollinators partly due to climate change could cause major economic issues.
Here, we assess how simulated heatwaves impact fertility and attractiveness (key parameters of sustainability) of bumblebee males. We used three model species: Bombus terrestris, a widespread and warm-adapted species, B. magnus and B. jonellus, two declining and cold-adapted species.
We highlight that heat shock (40°C) negatively affects sperm viability and sperm DNA integrity only in the two cold-adapted species. Heat shock can also impact the structure of cephalic labial glands and the production of pheromones only in the declining species.
The specific disruption in key reproductive traits we identify following simulated heatwave conditions could provide one important mechanistic explanation for why some pollinators are in decline through climate change.

Zenodo,Data from: Effects of arthropod inquilines on growth and reproductive effort among metacommunities of the purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea var. montana),"Many plant species harbor communities of symbionts that release nutrients used by their host plants. However, the importance of these nutrients to plant growth and reproductive effort is not well understood. Here, we evaluate the relationship between the communities that colonize pitcher plant phytotelmata and the pitcher plants' vegetative growth and flower production to better understand the symbiotic role played by phytotelma communities. We focus on the mountain variety purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea var. montana), which occurs in small and isolated populations in Western North Carolina. We found that greater symbiont community diversity is associated with higher flower production the following season. We then examined geographic variation in communities and found that smaller plant populations supported less diverse symbiont communities. We relate our observations to patterns of community diversity predicted by community ecology theory."

Zenodo,'Tidy' and 'messy' management alters natural enemy communities and pest control in urban agroecosystems,"Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice – woodchip mulching – on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a ""lazy gardener"" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services."

Zenodo,Lipid content and stable isotopes of zooplankton during five winters around the northern Antarctic Peninsula,"The Southern Ocean zooplankton community is diverse, yet most species are understudied, especially with respect to their overwinter feeding ecologies. This dataset describes body condition and trophic biomarker data (lipid content and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) from 19 zooplankton species collected over five consecutive winters (August and September 2012 – 2016) around the northern Antarctic Peninsula. To complement these data and provide context for interpretation, we report environmental data (percent sea-ice cover, sea-ice type, water temperature, salinity, and integrated chlorophyll-a (to 100 m)) as well as species abundance data at each sampling location. For most species, these are the first winter measurements or time series of body condition, trophic position, and abundance in relation to environmental variables around the northern Antarctic Peninsula. "
Zenodo,Data from: A low-cost solution for documenting distribution and abundance of endangered marine fauna and impacts from fisheries,"Fisheries bycatch is a widespread and serious issue that leads to declines of many important and threatened marine species. However, documenting the distribution, abundance, population trends and threats to sparse populations of marine species is often beyond the capacity of developing countries because such work is complex, time consuming and often extremely expensive. We have developed a flexible tool to document spatial distribution and population trends for dugongs and other marine species in the form of an interview questionnaire supported by a structured data upload sheet and a comprehensive project manual. Recognising the effort invested in getting interviewers to remote locations, the questionnaire is comprehensive, but low cost. The questionnaire has already been deployed in 18 countries across the Indo-Pacific region. Project teams spent an average of USD 5,000 per country and obtained large data sets on dugong distribution, trends, catch and bycatch, and threat overlaps. Findings indicated that >50% of respondents had never seen dugongs and that 20% had seen a single dugong in their lifetimes despite living and fishing in areas of known or suspected dugong habitat, suggesting that dugongs occured in low numbers. Only 3% of respondents had seen mother and calf pairs, indicative of low reproductive output. Dugong hunting was still common in several countries. Gillnets and hook and line were the most common fishing gears, with the greatest mortality caused by gillnets. The questionnaire has also been used to study manatees in the Caribbean, coastal cetaceans along the eastern Gulf of Thailand and western Peninsular Malaysia, and river dolphins in Peru. This questionnaire is a powerful tool for studying distribution and relative abundance for marine species and fishery pressures, and determining potential conservation hotspot areas. We provide the questionnaire and supporting documents for open-access use by the scientific and conservation communities."
