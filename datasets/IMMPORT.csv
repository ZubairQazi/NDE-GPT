VIGET: A web portal for study of vaccine-induced host responses based on Reactome pathways and ImmPort data,"Host responses to vaccines are complex but important to investigate. To facilitate the study, we have developed a tool called Vaccine Induced Gene Expression Analysis Tool (VIGET), with the aim to provide an interactive online tool for users to efficiently and robustly analyze the host immune response gene expression data collected in the ImmPort database. VIGET allows users to select vaccines, choose ImmPort studies, set up analysis models by choosing confounding variables and two groups of samples having different vaccination times, and then perform differential expression analysis to select genes for pathway enrichment analysis and functional interaction network construction using the Reactome’s web services. VIGET provides features for users to compare results from two analyses, facilitating comparative response analysis across different demographic groups. VIGET uses the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to classify various types of vaccines such as live or inactivated flu vaccines, yellow fever vaccines, etc. Different variables are classified using our Vaccine Investigation Ontology (VIO). To showcase the utilities of VIGET, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of immune responses to yellow fever vaccines and found an intriguing complex activity response pattern of pathways in the immune system annotated in Reactome, demonstrating that VIGET is a valuable web portal that supports effective vaccine response studies using Reactome pathways and ImmPort data. The portal has been deployed at https://viget.violinet.org/."

RImmPort: an R/Bioconductor package that enables ready-for-analysis immunology research data.,": Open access to raw clinical and molecular data related to immunological studies has created a tremendous opportunity for data-driven science. We have developed RImmPort that prepares NIAID-funded research study datasets in ImmPort (immport.org) for analysis in R. RImmPort comprises of three main components: (i) a specification of R classes that encapsulate study data, (ii) foundational methods to load data of a specific study and (iii) generic methods to slice and dice data across different dimensions in one or more studies. Furthermore, RImmPort supports open formalisms, such as CDISC standards on the open source bioinformatics platform Bioconductor, to ensure that ImmPort curated study datasets are seamlessly accessible and ready for analysis, thus enabling innovative bioinformatics research in immunology.RImmPort is available as part of Bioconductor (bioconductor.org/packages/RImmPort).rshankar@stanford.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

PLA2G6 in attenuating ferroptosis,"The study found that spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) is associated with ferroptosis and that inhibition of GPX4 causes ferroptotic injury in primary human trophoblasts and during mouse pregnancy. Importantly, the role for the phospholipase PLA2G6, known to metabolize Hp-PE to lyso-PE and oxidized fatty acid, was uncovered in mitigating ferroptosis induced by GPX4 inhibition in vitro or by hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in vivo. Together, ferroptosis signaling and the role for PLA2G6 in attenuating trophoblastic ferroptosis in the human and mouse placenta was identified, which provided mechanistic insights into the ill-defined placental lipotoxicity that may inspire PLA2G6-targeted therapeutic strategies"
An Arntl2-Driven Secretome Enables Lung Adenocarcinoma Metastatic Self-Sufficiency,"The ability of cancer cells to establish lethal metastatic lesions requires the survival and expansion of single cancer cells at distant sites. The factors controlling the clonal growth ability of individual cancer cells remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high expression of the transcription factor ARNTL2 predicts poor lung adenocarcinoma patient outcome. Arntl2 is required for metastatic ability in vivo and clonal growth in cell culture. Arntl2 drives metastatic self-sufficiency by orchestrating the expression of a complex pro-metastatic secretome. We identify Clock as an Arntl2 partner and functionally validate the matricellular protein Smoc2 as a pro-metastatic secreted factor. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms that enable single cancer cells to form allochthonous tumors in foreign tissue environments"
Epidemiological Evidence for Lineage-Specific Differences in the Risk of Inapparent Chikungunya Virus Infection,"Estimate the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic CHIKV infections (S:A ratio), elucidate sign and symptom cooccurrence, characterize the probability of infection and disease occurrence across age, identify risk factors associated with infection and disease outcomes, and quantify differences in the proportions of inapparent CHIKV infections between the Asian CHIKV lineage and the ECSA CHIKV lineage"
Susceptibility and Resistance to Common Encapsulated Bacteria Infections,"To study those patients who have history of at least one of 3 severe bacterial infections, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitides, and H. influenza. By asking what susceptibility genes that such patients have in common, we may find genes in pathways involved in resistance and susceptibility of a broader range of pathogens.Variants that correlate with a relatively common trait like encapsulated bacterial susceptibility and sepsis will likely alter expression or splicing rather than be coding mutations in most cases. Therefore, our initial functional validation of the host genes that we find in GWAS will be to look for differences in amounts of mRNA in circulating white cells in the context of sepsis that lead to death and longer hospitalization compared to cases that have better outcomes. "
Charge-Altering Releasable Transporters Enable Specific Phenotypic Manipulation Of Resting Primary Natural Killer Cells,"Natural killer (NK) cells are capable of rapid and robust cytotoxicity, making them excellent tools for immunotherapy. However, their recalcitrance to standard transfection techniques has limited both mechanistic studies and clinical applications. Current approaches for NK cell manipulation rely on viral transduction or methods requiring NK cell activation, which can alter NK cell function. Here, we report that non-viral Charge-Altering Releasable Transporters (CARTs) efficiently transfect primary human NK cells with mRNA without relying on NK cell activation."
Susceptibility and Resistance to Tuberculosis,"In Iceland tuberculosis was relatively common around the Second World War and a few thousand cases have been documented by the central universal access healthcare system since the 1930s. Extensive surveillance has been performed on exposed members and we also have information on those who convert but did not develop an infection. The BCG vaccine has never been used in Iceland; therefore, Iceland has an ideal population because this allows for very accurate documentation of those who were exposed and converted by a positive Mantoux skin test but did not come down with an infection. Mapping genes involved in these responses could yield valuable information about host susceptibility or resistance factors that determine vulnerability to mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.Therefore, our initial functional validation of the host genes that we find in GWAS will be to look for differences in amounts of mRNA and protein expressed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNs) from human volunteers with or without in vitro stimulation with M.tb. pathogen."
"Systems Biology Approach to Analysis of 2011-12 TIV Fluzone Influenza Vaccine Response in Healthy Individuals (see companion studies SDY74, SDY301)",This project will contribute to the overall vision and goals of this U19 by analyzing the immune response to Flu vaccination in healthy individuals.

RNA-seq data generated from sorted purified cell populations, including mDC and monocyte subsets will permit us to reveal distinct roles that DC and monocyte subsets play in eliciting immune responses to vaccines against flu in healthy adults using system biology approaches."
"Systems Biology Approach to Study Influenza Vaccine in Children with Autoimmunity (Juvenile Dermatomyositis JDM) 2012/2013 Cohort (see companion studies (SDY369, SDY376, SDY645)","This Project will study vaccine responses in healthy and sick children. It will address the following questions: 1) which are the best biomarkers of protective immune response to influenza vaccine in healthy children; 2) how unique autoimmune backgrounds set the stage for responsiveness/unresponsiveness to vaccines; 3) whether vaccination contributes to increase the breadth of autoimmunity in a disease-specific manner. Ultimately, we expect that these studies will shed light on basic aspects of humoral immune responses to vaccines and will permit us to discover biomarkers of response that can be applied to healthy children and to the general population."
Lovastatin Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis (ARA02),"This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial determining whether treatment with a statin reduces the serum CRP in subjects with mildly active RA. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will complete a screening visit (visit 0) to determine whether inclusion and exclusion entry criteria are fulfilled. Eligible subjects will return within 7 days for visit 1 to receive study medication (lovastatin 80 mg/day vs. placebo). Under certain circumstances, the dose may be adjusted. Subjects will return for evaluation every 4 weeks for the duration of this 12-week study. In addition, subjects will have a blood sample drawn at Day 14 to assess CPK and transaminase levels for safety monitoring."
Vaginal microbial signature for preterm birth,"Recent studies about association between maternal vaginal microbiota and risks for preterm birth (PTB) conflicted along similar lines: Caucasian and Asian women cohorts showed associations between PTB and low Lactobacillus vaginal communities (BV-like) while no significant association with PTB was detected in cohorts of African-American women. This study compares two new larger cohorts of women at low and high risk for PTB, addressing two challenges: (i) low power resulting from the combination of small study populations (30--91 pregnant women), the many taxa measured by metabarcoding, and the absence of initial hypotheses more specific than some difference between preterm and term gestations; and (ii) insufficient understanding of population-specific factors that might modulate the PTB--microbiota association."
Human microbiome characterization through massive shotgun sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA.,"Cell-free DNA-derived microbiomes of 1,351 samples from 188 patients in four longitudinally sampled cohorts were analyzed. The majority of assembled sequences from cfDNA are derived from previously unidentified organisms, for instance numerous novel anelloviruses in immunocompromised patients, which represent a doubling of identified members in that viral family. Over two thirds of the sequences are bacterial, and the majority are most similar to proteobacteria; however, many large contigs can only be classified at the phylum or superkingdom level. Numerous novel phages were also found throughout the population. Multiple independent analyses confirm the existence of these novel sequences."
Mechanisms Underlying Asthma Exacerbations Prevented and Persistent With Immune-Based Therapy (ICAC-29),"ICAC-29/MUPPITS-1 is a prospective, longitudinal, nested case-control study designed to identify changes in gene transcription predictive of and associated with asthma exacerbations in children ages 6 to 17 years with difficult-to-control, exacerbation-prone asthma. Participants will be followed prospectively for the onset of a cold and a subsequent asthma exacerbation. An internet-based asthma and cold symptom diary will be accessed by participants using a hand-held device. When the participant reports development of a cold, a clinic visit will be scheduled as soon as possible (within 48 hours of cold symptom onset) to collect blood and nasal samples. A second clinic visit will occur 4-6 days from the onset of cold symptoms to obtain samples after the initial cold, but prior to the use of systemic corticosteroids. Participants will be followed for up to two colds or approximately 6 months after Visit 0, whichever comes first."

Longitudinal Analyses Reveal Immunological Misfiring in Severe COVID-19 (Companion study to SDY1648),"Longitudinal analyses of COVID-19 patients revealed increasingly dysregulated and sustained inflammatory immune responses in severe disease compared to moderate disease. Maladaptive immune profiles included persistent type 1, type 2 and type 3 cytokines, as well as a mix of monocyte-related chemokines, and growth factors. Unbiased clustering of patients based on these measurements linked worse clinical outcomes to greater dysregulation in the immune response."
Early Prediction of Preeclampsia via Machine Learning,"An early prediction model for preeclampsia was developed with the use of machine learning methods that analyzed all available clinical and laboratory data during routine prenatal visits. Using the elastic net algorithm, a subset of the most informative features from all variables can be automatically identified. The obtained prediction model for preeclampsia yielded an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.75?0.83), sensitivity of 45.2%, and false-positive rate of 8.1%. The prediction model for early-onset preeclampsia achieved an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.84?0.95), true-positive rate of 72.3%, and false-positive rate of 8.8%."
Cas13d knockdown of lung protease Ctsl prevents and treats SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires specific host proteases; however, no successful in vivo applications of host protease inhibitors have yet been reported for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here we describe a chemically engineered nanosystem encapsulating CRISPR?Cas13d, developed to specifically target lung protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) messenger RNA to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. We show that this nanosystem decreases lung Ctsl expression in normal mice efficiently, specifically and safely. We further show that this approach extends survival of mice lethally infected with SARS-CoV-2, correlating with decreased lung virus burden, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and diminished severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Postinfection treatment by this nanosystem dramatically lowers the lung virus burden and alleviates virus-induced pathological changes. Our results indicate that targeting lung protease mRNA by Cas13d nanosystem represents a unique strategy for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate that CRISPR can be used as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
"Humoral responses to Influenza vaccination in aged populations - Year 1 2011 (See companion studies SDY622 2012, SDY648 2013, SDY739 2014, SDY819 2015)",The purpose of this study was to measure the antibody responses to the Trivalent Inactivated influenza Vaccine(TIV) in young and aged subjects
Gene expression changes in neonatal and adult plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) upon TLR7/8 stimulation,"Differences in gene expression changes between neonatal and adult plasmacytoid dendritic cells upon stimulation with TLR7/8 may point to specific signaling pathways which, in turn, may account for the known differential immune response of babies to vaccination or infection when compared to adults. Total RNA obtained from MACS-purified human pDC and mDC (using Miltenyi's Dendritic Cell Isolation Kits) that had been stimulated with the synthetic TLR7/8 ligand 3M-003 (at final concentration of 5 uM) for 1 or 6 hours in vitro compared to unstimulated pDC."

WISP-R ITN029ST: Withdrawal of Immunosuppression in Pediatric Liver Transplant Recipients,Immunosuppressive drugs are prescribed to organ transplant recipients to prevent organ rejection. Long-term use of these drugs places transplant recipients at higher risk of serious infections and certain types of cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether immunosuppressive drugs can be safely withdrawn over a minimum of 9 months from pediatric liver transplant recipents
Heritable influence on the  B and T cell receptor repertoire,"The adaptive immune systems capability to protect the body requires a highly diverse lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoire. However, the influence of individual genetic and epigenetic differences on these repertoires is frequently underestimated. By leveraging the unique characteristics of B, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets isolated from monozygotic twins, we have elucidated the impact of heritable factors on the V(D)J recombination process and have shown that the repertoires of both naive and antigen experienced cells are subject to biases resulting from initial recombination differences. Moreover, we show that the relative usage of V and J gene segments is chromosomally biased, with approximately 1.5 times as many rearrangements originating from a single chromosome. These data refine our understanding of the heritable mechanisms affecting the repertoire, and show that bias exists on a chromosome-wide level."
CD4 Nicaragua Epitope ID,We performed DENV-specific epitope screening studies in the general population of Managua. Peptides with the capacity to bind HLA DR molecules most common in the Nicaraguan population have been predicted and screened in an HLA matched fashion in blood donors from the Nicaraguan Red Cross previously exposed to dengue virus.
Crowdsourcing Assessment of Maternal Blood Multi-omics for Predicting Gestational Age and Preterm Birth,"Identification of pregnancies at risk of preterm birth (PTB), the leading cause of newborn deaths, remains challenging given the syndromic nature of the disease. We report a longitudinal multi-omics study coupled with a DREAM challenge to develop predictive models of PTB. We found that whole blood gene expression predicts ultrasound-based gestational ages in normal and complicated pregnancies, as well as the delivery date in normal pregnancies, with an accuracy similar to ultrasound. However, unlike the latter, transcriptomic data collected <37 weeks of gestation predicted the delivery date of one third of spontaneous (sPTB) cases within 2 weeks of the actual date. When only those samples collected <33 weeks from asymptomatic women were used, we found expression changes preceding preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes that were consistent across time points and cohorts, involving, among others, leukocyte-mediated immunity. Plasma proteomic data predicted sPTB with higher accuracy and earlier in pregnancy than whole blood transcriptomic data."

Comprehensive analysis of T cell immunodominance and immunoprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in COVID-19 cases,"T cells are involved in control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To establish the patterns of immunodominance of different SARS-CoV-2 antigens and precisely measure virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we study epitope-specific T cell responses of 99 convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is probed using 1,925 peptides spanning the entire genome, ensuring an unbiased coverage of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles for class II responses. For HLA class I, we study an additional 5,600 predicted binding epitopes for 28 prominent HLA class I alleles, accounting for wide global coverage. We identify several hundred HLA-restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. Distinct patterns of immunodominance are observed, which differ for CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and antibodies. The class I and class II epitopes are combined into epitope megapools to facilitate identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells."
Metabolomic and transcriptomic signatures of influenza vaccine response in healthy young and older adults,"Seasonal epidemics caused by influenza viruses are a major public health concern that result in mild to severe respiratory infections in humans. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, particularly among adults aged 65 or older. While three types of effective vaccines (inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant hemagglutinin antigen (HA) vaccines) have been developed to help improve health outcomes, vaccine response remains poor, particularly in older populations. In this study, we use a combination of transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics to define signatures of high and low antibody response after vaccination against influenza in a cohort of young and older adults. Through this multi-omics approach, we identify age-related molecular markers associated with influenza vaccine response. Uncovering these molecular profiles will help to identify populations at risk of influenza vaccine failure, as well as to inform design of vaccine development trials to improve vaccine efficacy."
Immune memory to COVID-19 vaccines,"The present 6-month longitudinal study was designed to establish the magnitude and duration of vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific immune memory. Comparisons of cellular and serological immune components were made for three different vaccine platforms, namely two different mRNA vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 and Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2), a viral vector-based vaccine (Janssen Ad26.COV2.S), the protein-based adjuvanted vaccine Novavax NVX-CoV2373 as well as natural infection for reference."
Neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4/5 and BA.2.12.1 Subvariants,"Emerging subvariants of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have reignited concern about further immune escape. Specifically, BA.2.12.1, which is on the rise in the United States, has two more mutations (L452Q and S704L) than BA.2 (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). In addition, BA.4 and BA.5 (hereafter, BA.4/5), which bear identical spike proteins, have become the dominant strains in South Africa. Here, we examine neutralizing-antibody titers in serum samples obtained from vaccinated persons who had received a single booster dose of the same vaccine used in the two-dose series and who had been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."
Neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 Deltacron and BA.3 Variants,"We used a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay to examine neutralizing-antibody titers in serum samples obtained from vaccinated health care workers at the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University as well as from patients with confirmed Covid-19 during the delta and omicron waves in the Columbus, Ohio, area. We evaluated neutralizing-antibody titers against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain bearing the D614G mutation, along with the understudied BA.3 and deltacron variants, and compared the responses with previously reported results for the BA.1, BA.2, and delta variants."
Cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies with diverse epitope specificities and Fc effector functions,"The continual emergence of novel coronaviruses (CoV), such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-(SARS)-CoV-2, highlights the critical need for broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines against this family of viruses. From a recovered SARS-CoV donor sample, we identify and characterize a panel of six monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with CoV spike (S) proteins from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrate a spectrum of reactivity against other CoVs. Epitope mapping reveals that these antibodies recognize multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S, including the receptor-binding domain, the N-terminal domain, and the S2 subunit. Functional characterization demonstrates that the antibodies mediate phagocytosis-and in some cases trogocytosis-but not neutralization in vitro. When tested in vivo in murine models, two of the antibodies demonstrate a reduction in hemorrhagic pathology in the lungs. The identification of cross-reactive epitopes recognized by functional antibodies expands the repertoire of targets for pan-coronavirus vaccine design strategies."

Adaptive and innate immunity in sPTB,"This study is a meta-analysis evaluating differential gene expression signals in spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). Three studies related to sPTB with maternal whole blood samples were selected in publicly available datasets, resulting in data from 339 samples. A meta-analysis of the aggregated and normalized transcriptomic datasets led to identification of 210 genes differentially expressed in sPTB relative to term birth. These genes were enriched in immune related pathways, showing upregulation of innate immunity and downregulation of adaptive immunity in women who delivered preterm. Additional analyses identified potential clinically relevant biomarkers."

Proinflammatory IgG Fc structures in patients with severe COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which manifests with a range of severities from mild illness to life-threatening pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory signature, including high levels of inflammatory cytokines, alveolar inflammatory infiltrates and vascular microthrombi. Here we show that patients with severe COVID-19 produced a unique serologic signature, including an increased likelihood of IgG1 with afucosylated Fc glycans. This Fc modification on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgGs enhanced interactions with the activating Fc-Gamma receptor Fc-Gamma RIIIa; when incorporated into immune complexes, Fc afucosylation enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. These results show that disease severity in COVID-19 correlates with the presence of proinflammatory IgG Fc structures, including afucosylated IgG1."
"Systems Biology Approach to Study Influenza Vaccine in Children with Autoimmunity (Juvenile Dermatomyositis JDM) 2011/2012 Cohort (see companion studies SDY376, SDY372, SDY645)","This Project will study vaccine responses in healthy and sick children. It will address the following questions: 1) which are the best biomarkers of protective immune response to influenza vaccine in healthy children; 2) how unique autoimmune backgrounds set the stage for responsiveness/unresponsiveness to vaccines; 3) whether vaccination contributes to increase the breadth of autoimmunity in a disease-specific manner. Ultimately, we expect that these studies will shed light on basic aspects of humoral immune responses to vaccines and will permit us to discover biomarkers of response that can be applied to healthy children and to the general population."
IL2-RAPA ITN018AI:  Proleukin and Rapamune in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"At the time of diagnosis, type 1 diabetes patients have 15-40 percent of their beta cells may remain active and healthy in the pancreas. This Phase I study for individuals 18-45 years of age and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the past 3-48 months will be treated with Proleukin (subcutaneously) 3 times per week for 28 days and Rapamune (orally, daily) for 12 weeks. The trial will test whether the combination of Proleukin and Rapamune can be safely administered and whether treatment halts the autoimmune destruction of remaining beta cells."
Characterization of in vitro Stimulated B Cells from Human Subjects,"During the human B cell (Bc) recall response, rapid cell division results in multiple Bc subpopulations. RNA microarray and functional analyses showed that proliferating CD27lo cells are a transient pre-plasmablast population, expressing genes associated with Bc receptor editing. Undivided cells had an active transcriptional program of non-ASC B cell functions, including cytokine secretion and costimulation, suggesting a link between innate and adaptive Bc responses. Transcriptome analysis suggested a gene regulatory network for CD27lo and CD27hi Bc differentiation."
VRC304 - A Phase I Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant DNA Plasmid Vaccine (VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP) Encoding for the Influenza Virus H5 Hemagglutinin Protein in Healthy Adults,"The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational vaccine VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP in humans at doses 1 mg and 4 mg administered intramuscularly using a needle-free injection system. The secondary objectives included evaluation of whether VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP (at doses 1 mg and 4 mg) induced antibodies as assessed by an HAI assay at Day 0 and Week 12. Exploratory analyses included evaluation of the immunogenicity of VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP at doses 1 mg and 4 mg using intracellular cytokine staining, ELISpot, neutralizing antibody assay, HAI assay to H1 or H3HA or other immunological assays at time intervals between Day 0 and Week 42."
Generation of Memory T cells In Young Healthy and Immunocompromised Populations,"To expand our study of T cell memory repertoires to include healthy children who should still be in the process of generating memory repertoires. These studies will provide data about the age dynamics of memory repertoires. In addition to children, we will examine flu-specific memory repertoires in children with autoimmune diseases who are undergoing mild immunosuppression. This should describe the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on memory formation and function. "
A Haystack Heuristic for Autoimmune Disease Biomarker Discovery Using Next-Gen Immune Repertoire Sequencing Data,"In this work, we present a new algorithm that employs local search techniques to discover statistically significant patient-specific motifs in large-scale immune-repertoire datasets. We apply our methodology successfully to our multi-million-sequence immune repertoire dataset to discover a statistically significant MS-specific motif. The discovered sequence motif could potentially serve as biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. The presented methodology is efficient and generalizable to other high throughput sequencing datasets."
Early pregnancy vaginal microbiome trends and preterm birth (see companion study SDY1341),"Previous studies have shown that vaginal microbiota of asymptomatic, nonpregnant, reproductive age women cluster into 5 distinct community-state types, which differ both by dominant Lactobacillus species as well as overall community composition. A much greater proportion of African-American and Hispanic women harbored a non-Lactobacillus-dominant community, suggesting that in some women a non-Lactobacillus-based vaginal community may be a normal variant. A recent study examined vaginal microbial composition and the risk for preterm birth but had very few African-American subjects and few preterm births. This study characterizes vaginal microbial community characteristics over time in a large predominantly African-American cohort of pregnant women and test whether particular community characteristics are associated with the risk for subsequent preterm birth."
Evasion of neutralizing antibody responses by the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.75 variant,"The newly emerged BA.2.75 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant contains 9 additional mutations in its spike (S) protein compared to the ancestral BA.2 variant. Here, we examine the neutralizing antibody escape of BA.2.75 in mRNA-vaccinated and BA.1-infected individuals, as well as the molecular basis underlying functional changes in S. Notably, BA.2.75 exhibits enhanced neutralization resistance over BA.2 but less than the BA.4/5 variant. The G446S and N460K mutations of BA.2.75 are primarily responsible for its enhanced resistance to neutralizing antibodies. The R493Q mutation, a reversion to the prototype sequence, reduces BA.2.75 neutralization resistance. The impact of these mutations is consistent with their locations in common neutralizing antibody epitopes. Further, BA.2.75 shows enhanced cell-cell fusion over BA.2, driven largely by the N460K mutation, which enhances S processing. Structural modeling reveals enhanced receptor contacts introduced by N460K, suggesting a mechanism of potentiated receptor utilization and syncytia formation."
Dataset from Identification and Mechanistic Investigations of Tolerant Transplant Recipients,The purpose of this multi-center (observational) registry study is to establish a database of clinical and laboratory information that may help to identify any unique characteristics of tolerant participants that differ from participants who reject their kidney after discontinuing immunosuppressive drugs.

Dataset from Safety and Immunogenicity of Candidate Tuberculosis (TB) Vaccine MVA85A Administered by the Intramuscular Route and the Intradermal Route: a Phase I Randomised Active Controlled Trial,This is a phase I study that will compare the safety and immunogenicity of candidate tuberculosis (TB) vaccine MVA85A administered by the intramuscular route and the intradermal route in healthy adult individuals who have been previously vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).
KIR and HLA in MS,"The association of specific alleles and haplotypes at the HLA class I and class II loci with a variety of autoimmune diseases is well established. Recently, polymorphisms in the Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) genes that encode the stimulatory and inhibitory receptors on NK cells have been reported to be associated with a few of the same HLA-associated diseases, (e.g. psoriatic arthritis, scleroderma, and T1D). The ligands recognized by many of these receptors are epitopes on HLA class I molecules. In this study, we examine the role of HLA and KIR alleles, haplotypes, and KIR gene-HLA ligand pairs with a clinically well-defined Multiple Sclerosis cohort and ethnically matched controls using our Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing system for allelic resolution typing of HLA and our high-throughput MALDI-TOF KIR genotyping assay."
A Retrospective Multicenter Study to Determine 4-Year Clinical Outcomes in Subjects Previously Enrolled in the CTOT-05 Study (CTOT-18),"This study is a multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective study to collect long term (4 years post-transplant) clinical outcome data on subjects previously enrolled in the CTOT-05 study."
"Heterogeneity of human anti-viral immunity shaped by virus, tissue, age, and sex","The persistence of anti-viral immunity throughout the human body is essential for protection, and exhibits profound heterogeneity across individuals. Here, we elucidate the factors that shape maintenance and function of anti-viral T cell immunity by comprehensive profiling of virus-specific T cells across blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of organ donors. We used flow cytometry, T cell receptor analysis, single-cell transcriptomics, and cytokine analysis to profile virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing ubiquitous pathogens influenza and cytomegalovirus. Our results reveal that virus specificity determines overall magnitude, tissue distribution, differentiation, and clonal repertoire of virus-specific T cells. Age and sex influence T cell differentiation and dissemination in tissues, while T cell tissue residence and functionality is highly correlated with the site. Together, our results demonstrate how the covariates of virus, tissue, age, and sex impact the anti-viral immune response, important for targeting, monitoring, and predicting immune responses to existing and emerging viruses."
The roles of CD103 and CD49a in adherence and motility of CD8 T cells,"Tissue resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cells are a unique immune memory subset that develops and remains in peripheral tissues at the site of infection, providing future host resistance upon re-exposure to that pathogen. In the pulmonary system, TRM are identified through S1P antagonist CD69 and expression of integrins CD103/_7 and CD49a/CD29(_1). Contrary to the established role of CD69 on CD8 T cells, the functions of CD103 and CD49a on this population are not well defined. This study examines the expression patterns and functions of CD103 and CD49a with a specific focus on their impact on T cell motility during influenza virus infection. We show that the TRM cell surface phenotype develops by two-weeks post-infection and that each integrin contributes a distinct function regulating CD8 T cell motility both in vitro and in vivo, with CD49a facilitating migration and CD103 limiting motility through tethering. These results demonstrate for the first time how CD103 and CD49a differentially impact adherence and migration in the tissue, likely affecting overall retention, maintenance of TRM, and host protection."
Single-cell transcriptomics of human T cells,"Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity in diverse anatomic compartments through production of cytokines and effector molecules, but it is unclear how tissue site influences T cell persistence and function. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease."
The association between vaginal bacterial composition and miscarriage,"To characterise vaginal bacterial composition in early pregnancy and investigate its relationship with first and second trimester miscarriages, the study conducted prospective profiling on 161 pregnancies by using 16S rRNA gene?based metataxonomics from 5 weeks? gestation in pregnancies ending in miscarriage (78) or uncomplicated term deliveries (83) matched for age, gestation and body mass index. Relative vaginal bacteria abundance, diversity and richness were measured and compared among cohorts. RESULTs: Vaginal bacterial composition in first trimester miscarriage is associated with reduced Lactobacillus spp. abundance and is independent of vaginal bleeding. Incomplete/complete miscarriage associated with higher proportions of Lactobacillus spp.?depleted communities compared with missed miscarriage. Early pregnancy vaginal bacterial stability was similar between miscarriage and term pregnancies."
Mouse blood gene expression after administration of 137 Cesium,"In the current study, we investigated the gene expression response of blood cells of mice that were injected with variable amounts of 137Cs. We isolated total RNA from peripheral blood from mice with 0 (control), 158, 191, 215 and 259 uCi cesium source amount on days 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after injection. Using Agilent Mouse Whole Genome microarrays, we identified x genes that were significantly differentially expressed across the 14-day time course of this study. We identified common biological functions affected that persisted across the 14-day study."
Population impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility and/or partial immune escape,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit varying degrees of transmissibility and, in some cases, escape from acquired immunity. Much effort has been devoted to measuring these phenotypes, but understanding their impact on the course of the pandemic-especially that of immune escape-has remained a challenge. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of wild-type and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccine rollout and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We show that variants with enhanced transmissibility frequently increase epidemic severity, whereas those with partial immune escape either fail to spread widely or primarily cause reinfections and breakthrough infections. However, when these phenotypes are combined, a variant can continue spreading even as immunity builds up in the population, limiting the impact of vaccination and exacerbating the epidemic. These findings help explain the trajectories of past and present SARS-CoV-2 variants and may inform variant assessment and response in the future."

Impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity in infected or vaccinated individuals,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with evidence of antibody escape highlight the importance of addressing whether the total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recognition is also affected. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C lineages in COVID-19 convalescents and in recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. The total reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is similar in terms of magnitude and frequency of response, with decreases in the 10%?22% range observed in some assay/VOC combinations. A total of 7% and 3% of previously identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, respectively, are affected by mutations in the various VOCs. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 variants analyzed here do not significantly disrupt the total SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity; however, the decreases observed highlight the importance for active monitoring of T cell reactivity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 evolution."
Simulation and Prediction of the Adaptive Immune Response and Quantification of Early and Adaptive Immune Response Kinetics to Influenza A Virus Infection,"Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. Modeling approaches were used combined with experimental data to investigate innate and adaptive immune responses to IAV infection. Mathematical models developed describe the dynamic interactions between influenza virus, target cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and virus-specific IgG and IgM. A two-compartment model developed quantifies the effects of viral replication and adaptive immunity."
T cell responses to H1N1v and a longitudinal study of seasonal influenza vaccination SLVP015 2013,"Systems biology approach to examine effects of seasonal flu vaccination in adults of different ages on gene expression, cytokine stimulation and serum cytokines with parameters such as immune senescence to uncover new markers and mechanisms behind failure of immune function in many older people."
Steroid and Tacrolimus Avoidance Using NULOJIX (Belatacept) in Renal Transplantation (CTOT-16),"Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including kidney damage. Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who receive a kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the kidney continues to work. The purpose of this study is to determine if NULOJIX (belatacept), will minimize serious long term side effects seen with anti-rejection medications while still protecting the transplanted kidney from damage. The researchers also want to learn more about the safety of this treatment and the long term health of the transplanted kidney."
"The interaction between the vaginal microbiome, cervical length and vaginal progesterone treatment for preterm birth risk","Preterm birth is the primary cause of infant death worldwide. A short cervix in the second trimester of pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm birth. In specific patient cohorts, vaginal progesterone reduces this risk. By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in women at risk of preterm birth (n?=?161), the study assessed 1) the relationship between vaginal microbiota and cervical length in the second trimester and preterm birth risk and 2) the impact of vaginal progesterone on vaginal bacterial communities in women with a short cervix."
A Retrospective Multicenter Study to Determine Clinical Outcomes in Subjects Previously Enrolled in the CTOTC-03 Study (CTOTC-14),"This study is a multicenter, non?randomized, retrospective study to collect long term (5 years post?transplant +/- 6 months) clinical outcome data on subjects previously enrolled in the CTOTC-03 study."
COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 elicits a protective immune profile in mice that is not associated with vaccine-enhanced disease upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge,"Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) was previously observed in some preclinical models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS coronavirus vaccines. We used the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mouse-adapted, passage 10, lethal challenge virus (MA10) mouse model of acute lung injury to evaluate the immune response and potential for immunopathology in animals vaccinated with research-grade mRNA-1273. Whole-inactivated virus or heat-denatured spike protein subunit vaccines with alum designed to elicit low-potency antibodies and Th2-skewed CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced viral titers and weight loss post challenge but more severe pathological changes in the lung compared to saline-immunized animals. In contrast, a protective dose of mRNA-1273 induced favorable humoral and cellular immune responses that protected from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract upon challenge. A subprotective dose of mRNA-1273 reduced viral replication and limited histopathological manifestations compared to animals given saline. Overall, our findings demonstrate an immunological signature associated with antiviral protection without disease enhancement following vaccination with mRNA-1273."
RELIVE Informed Consent Study (RELIVE-03),"The goal of this study was to study informed consent by the living donor. This study used surveys to evaluate the understanding of risk and psychological pressure that living organ donors felt when making the decision to donate. It compared participants' answers across geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds. "
Bioinformatics Approach to 2010-2011 TIV Influenza A/H1N1 Vaccine Immune Profiling,"Aim 1: Characterize Immune Profiles Over Time, Aim 2: Correlate Immune Profiles with Vaccine Immunogenicity,Aim 3: Replication of Immune Profiles and Verification of Models "
Characterization of maternal serum gene expression and microbiome,"Plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) encompasses a broad spectrum of RNA species that can be derived from both human cells and microbes. Because cfRNA is fragmented and of low concentration, it has been challenging to profile its transcriptome using standard RNA-seq methods. This study assessed several recent RNA-seq methods on cfRNA samples to analyze the dynamic changes of both the human transcriptome and the microbiome of plasma during pregnancy. cfRNA reflected a well-orchestrated immune modulation during pregnancy: an up-regulation of anti-inflammatory genes and an increased abundance of anti-microbial genes, while the plasma microbiome remained relatively stable during pregnancy. The bacteria Ureaplasma shows an increased prevalence and increased abundance at postpartum, which is likely to be associated with postpartum infection. This study demonstrated that cfRNA-seq can be used to detect a number of human pathogens, including high loads of human parvovirus B19 virus (B19V), known to be a potential cause of complications in pregnancy."
"Systems Biology Approach to Analysis of 2010-11 TIV Fluzone Influenza Vaccine Response in Healthy Individuals (see companion studies SDY301, SDY296)","This study will measure the immune response to the influenza vaccine The long-term goal is to develop improved vaccines to infectious diseases such as influenza. Blood will be collected from patients at several visits before and after vaccination. The blood will be used in a series of immunological tests to measure the strength and breadth of immune response. These assays may include T cell and B cell activation assays, microarray testing, Epimax, Epigen, and flow cytometry."
Biomarkers of Cockroach Sublingual Immunotherapy 2 (BioCSI 2/ICAC-17),"This study looks to compare two doses of glycerinated German cockroach allergenic extract versus placebo administered via the sublingual route in 99 children ages 5 to 17 years with perennial allergic rhinitis, asthma, or both. It is designed to study biomarkers of the immune response to allergen immunotherapy as well as the safety of this therapy."
A targetable CD109-Janus kinase-Stat axis in metastatic lung cancer.,"The molecular mechanism of lung cancer metastatic remains incompletely understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival. Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical, pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable pro-metastatic CD109--Jak--Stat3 axis"
A Retrospective Multicenter Study to Determine 5-Year Clinical Outcomes in Subjects Previously Enrolled in the CTOT-01 Study (CTOT-17),"This study is a multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective study to collect long term (5 years posttransplant +/- 6 months) clinical outcome data on subjects previously enrolled in the CTOT-01 study."
Immune response evaluation in patients treated with TNF-alpha blockade (anti-TNF),"This project is to develop and apply the University of Rochester Program for Biodefense of Immunocompromised Populations (URPBIP) to the systematic study of human immune function with the goal of identifying defective mechanisms of immune response in patients treated with TNF-alpha blockade (anti-TNF). Studies are designed to detect changes that are likely to be induced by sustained TNF-alpha neutralization in the immune homeostasis and immune responsiveness of B-cells, T-cells and Dendritic cells. Although the study is not specifically designed to understand immune function in the elderly, the inclusion of a subset of patients and controls over and under 50 may result in the discovery of age-specific defects."
T cell responses to H1N1v and a longitudinal study of seasonal influenza vaccination SLVP015 2014,"Systems biology approach to examine effects of seasonal flu vaccination in adults of different ages on gene expression, cytokine stimulation and serum cytokines with parameters such as immune senescence to uncover new markers and mechanisms behind failure of immune function in many older people."
Kinetics of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells are made in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the kinetics and durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines and assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the immune memory of all three branches of adaptive immunity (CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and humoral immunity) in a predominantly cross-sectional study, including a longitudinal subset, extending for up to eight months post-infection."
Multicenter Mayo Genomics Trial (GEN-04),"Gene expression profiling is used to study the activity of genes. Each gene has an ""on/off"" switch that controls how they are expressed in a cell, as well as a ""volume control"" that increases or decreases the level of expression of a particular gene as necessary. Researchers want to see if the presence and abundance of certain transcripts in a kidney biopsy at one year after transplant can predict which kidneys will have reduced function over time."
35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35):  dual transcriptomic profile of nasopharyngeal aspirates,"Among infants (age <1 year) hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we used dual transcriptomic profiling of the nasopharyngeal aspirates to identify an endotype with a higher risk for developing asthma. For enrolled infants, hospital site teams collected nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) within 24 hours of the bronchiolitis hospitalization. Total RNA was isolated from the NPA samples using Trizol LS reagent in combination with the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit. RNA was prepared for sequencing using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 using a S4 100PE Flowcell (Illumina, San Diego, CA)."
Durability of Anti-Spike Antibodies in Infants After Maternal COVID-19 Vaccination or Natural Infection,"Understanding the persistence of maternal antibody levels in infants is important because COVID-19 infections in this age group account for a disproportionate burden of pediatric SARS-CoV-2?associated morbidity6 and because COVID-19 vaccines are not currently planned for administration to infants younger than 6 months. Study limitations include the small number of infants, the longer mean time to follow-up in the infected group (due to pragmatic constraints related to timing of COVID-19 surges in Boston and the availability of participants for timely follow-up), and the reporting of antibody titers rather than clinical outcomes. Although the antibody titer known to be protective against COVID-19 in infants isunknown, these findings provide further incentive for pregnant individuals to pursue COVID-19 vaccination."
Malaria Vaccine in Healthy Adults,"Approximately 168 healthy, malaria-naive volunteers aged 18 - 50 years, divided into 2 groups (84 in each group), will receive either one dose of Ad35.CS.01 followed by two doses of 257049 at monthly intervals or 3 doses of 257049 vaccine at monthly intervals. Of these, a maximum of 138 vaccinated volunteers will be challenged with P. falciparum infected mosquitoes. The challenge will occur 2 weeks following the third immunization. A group of up to 18 infectivity controls will begin participation in the study at the challenge stage. These controls receive no vaccine and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to provide comparison group for vaccinated individuals."
Dendritic Cell Maturation Dynamics,"Maturation and migration to lymph nodes (LNs) constitutes a central paradigm in conventional dendritic cell (cDC) biology but remains poorly defined in humans. Using our organ donor tissue resource, we analyzed cDC subset distribution, maturation, and migration in mucosal tissues (lungs, intestines), associated lymph nodes (LNs), and other lymphoid sites from 78 individuals ranging from less than 1 year to 93 years of age. The distribution of cDC1 (CD141hiCD13hi) and cDC2 (Sirp-?+CD1c+) subsets was a function of tissue site and was conserved between donors. We identified cDC2 as the major mature (HLA-DRhi) subset in LNs with the highest frequency in lung-draining LNs. Mature cDC2 in mucosal-draining LNs expressed tissue-specific markers derived from the paired mucosal site, reflecting their tissue-migratory origin. These distribution and maturation patterns were largely maintained throughout life, with site-specific variations. Our findings provide evidence for localized DC tissue surveillance and reveal a lifelong division of labor between DC subsets, with cDC2 functioning as guardians of the mucosa."
Merck Ad5/HIV induces broad innate immune activation that predicts CD8_ T-cell responses but is attenuated by preexisting Ad5 immunity.,This study will look for relationships among the immune responses induced by MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine. The study will also determine if the T cells that respond to different vaccine epitopes have correspondingly different functional profiles. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine regimen as well.
B-cell responses to meningococcal vaccine.,"Background: Neisseria meningitidis is a globally important cause of meningitis and septicaemia. Twelve capsular groups of meningococci are known, and quadrivalent vaccines against four of these (A, C, W and Y) are available as plain-polysaccharide and protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. Here we apply contemporary methods to describe B-cell responses to meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. Methods: Twenty adults were randomly assigned to receive either a meningococcal plain-polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine; one month later all received the conjugate vaccine. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccination and 7, 21 and 28 days after vaccination; B-cell responses were assessed by ELISpot, serum bactericidal assay, flow cytometry and gene expression microarray. Results: Seven days after an initial dose of either vaccine, a gene expression signature characteristic of plasmablasts was detectable. The frequency of newly generated plasma cells (CXCR3+HLA-DR+) and the expression of transcripts derived from IGKC and IGHG2 correlated with immunogenicity. Notably, using an independent dataset, the expression of glucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase was found to reproducibly correlate with the magnitude of immune response. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric data revealed depletion of switched memory B cells following plain-polysaccharide vaccine."
Effect of age on 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine response,To comprehensively compare the humoral immune response of young (20-31 years old) to older human subjects (60 to >90 years old) following vaccination with seasonal flu vaccine. We generated a peptide microarray featuring tiled peptides with sequences derived from the hemagglutinin proteins of multiple influenza strains. We probed the microarrays with pre- and post-vaccination serum from each age group. Serum antibody reactivity to the microarray peptides was quantified using fluorescently labeled anti-human secondary antibodies and a fluorescent microarray scanner.
Immunity to seasonal coronavirus spike proteins does not protect from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model,"Mice were vaccinated with the spike proteins of 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2 (expressed as soluble trimers) with an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant in a prime-boost regimen. Control mice were vaccinated with an irrelevant recombinant antigen, recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Three weeks after boost, mice were transduced intranasally with a non-replicating adenovirus expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) followed by a challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 strain Washington-1 five days later. Finally, this vaccination experiment was repeated. However, instead of a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, animals were vaccinated 3 weeks post boost with a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine (mRNA-LNP) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein."
Nucleocapsid Antigenemia Is a Marker of Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is essential for diagnosis, treatment, and infection control. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fails to distinguish acute from resolved infections, as RNA is frequently detected after infectiousness. We hypothesized that nucleocapsid in blood marks acute infection with the potential to enhance isolation and treatment strategies. In a retrospective serosurvey of inpatient and outpatient encounters, we categorized samples along an infection timeline using timing of SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptomatology. Among 1860 specimens from 1607 patients, the highest levels and frequency of antigenemia were observed in samples from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antigenemia was higher in seronegative individuals and in those with severe disease. In our analysis, antigenemia exhibited 85.8% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity as a biomarker for acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, antigenemia sensitively and specifically marks acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study is warranted to determine whether antigenemia may aid individualized assessment of active COVID-19."
"Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-lineages BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2","Recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant sub-lineages, BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2, have reignited concern over potential escape from vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. We examine the sensitivity of these sub-lineages and other major variants to neutralizing antibodies from mRNA-vaccinated and boosted individuals, as well as recovered COVID-19 patients, including those infected with Omicron. We find that all Omicron sub-lineages, especially BA.1 and BA.1.1, exhibit substantial immune escape that is largely overcome by mRNA vaccine booster doses. While Omicron BA.1.1 escapes almost completely from neutralization by early-pandemic COVID-19 patient sera and to a lesser extent from sera of Delta-infected patients, BA.1.1 is sensitive to Omicron-infected patient sera. Critically, all Omicron sub-lineages, including BA.2, are comparably neutralized by Omicron patient sera. These results highlight the importance of booster vaccine doses for protection against all Omicron variants and provide insight into the immunity from natural infection against Omicron sub-lineages."
Human TLR4/MD-2 knockin (KI) mice and comparison of TLR4 agonists ability to enhance innate immunity and development of adaptive immunity in mice,"The study's aim is to generate knockin (KI) mice expressing human TLR4 (huTLR4KI mice), human MD-2 (huMD-2KI mice) and both human TLR4 and MD-2 (TLR4/MD-2 KI mice) rather than the endogenous murine gene(s). The rationale is that differences in responses to non-enteric (variant) LPSs between humans and mice may limit the applicability of murine models as a means to 1) assess host responses to infection with organisms like Y. pestis, from which LPS triggers little response via human compared to murine TLR4/MD-2. 2) evaluate the safety and efficacy of purified/synthetic TLR4 ligand immunotherapeutics. Initial characterization of KI mice was done to determination the safety of MPL, a purified TLR4 agonist, in TLR4/MD-2 KI mice compared to wildtype mice. The study generated data to evaluate the ability of MPL (and for comparison a CpG TLR9 agonist) to enhance antibody and T cell responses and thus protective immunity induced by immunization of wildtype and TLR4/MD-2 KI mice with F1 plus V antigen from Y. pestis."
CD33 recruitment inhibits IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and desensitizes mast cells to allergen,"Allergen immunotherapy for patients with allergies begins with weekly escalating doses of allergen under medical supervision to monitor and treat IgE mast cellmediated anaphylaxis. There is currently no treatment to safely desensitize mast cells to enable robust allergen immunotherapy with therapeutic levels of allergen. Here, we demonstrated that liposomal nanoparticles bearing an allergen and a high-affinity glycan ligand of the inhibitory receptor CD33 profoundly suppressed IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, prevented anaphylaxis in Tg mice with mast cells expressing human CD33, and desensitized mice to subsequent allergen challenge for several days. We showed that high levels of CD33 were consistently expressed on human skin mast cells and that the antigenic liposomes with CD33 ligand prevented IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction in slices of human lung. The results demonstrated the potential of exploiting CD33 to desensitize mast cells to provide a therapeutic window for administering allergen immunotherapy without triggering anaphylaxis."
Association of CD4+ CD8+ T cells with risk of plasma leakage in Dengue disease,"This study provided novel insight into the host immune response during the acute febrile phase of DENV infection and the role of CD4+CD8+ DP T cells in the pathogenesis of plasma leakage using transcriptome analysis. The frequency of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells was significantly increased in patients at risk of developing plasma leakage. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that CD4+CD8+ DP cells co-clustered with CD8+ SP cells, and showed a similar expression profile in patients with and without warning signs of plasma leakage, implying a role of CD4+CD8+ DP cells in plasma leakage through a quantitative increase rather than functional alteration."
The effect of secretor status and the vaginal microbiome on birth outcome,"Mutations in the FUT2 gene that result in a lack of expression of histo-blood group antigens on secreted glycoproteins may shape the vaginal microbiota with consequences for birth outcome. To test this, we analysed the relationship between secretor status, vaginal microbiota and gestational length in an ethnically diverse cohort of 313 pregnant women, including 91 who delivered prematurely. Lactobacillus species were found to co-occur less often with other microbial taxa in non-secretors. Moreover, non-secretors with Lactobacillus spp. depleted vaginal microbiota in early pregnancy had significantly shorter gestational length than Lactobacillus spp. dominated non-secretors (mean of 245.5 (SD=44.5) versus 265.9 (23.6)); p=0.045), but not compared to Lactobacillus spp. dominated (261.8 (27.5)) and depleted (264.3 days (21.2)) secretors. In identifying a relationship between blood-group antigen expression and vaginal microbiota-host interactions, our results point towards stratification by secretor status as an important factor for considering preterm birth risk and prevention."
Vaccine protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in macaques,"The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, including in highly vaccinated populations, has raised important questions about the efficacy of current vaccines. In this study, we show that the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine and the adenovirus-vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine provide robust protection against high-dose challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in cynomolgus macaques. We vaccinated 30 macaques with homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S. Following Omicron challenge, vaccinated macaques demonstrated rapid control of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage, and most vaccinated animals also controlled virus in nasal swabs. However, 4 vaccinated animals that had moderate Omicron-neutralizing antibody titers and undetectable Omicron CD8+ T cell responses failed to control virus in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover, virologic control correlated with both antibody and T cell responses. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to vaccine protection against a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant."

Use of Infliximab for the Treatment of Pemphigus Vulgaris (APV01),"PV involves blistering of the outer layer of skin and mucous membranes, causing a separation of epidermal cells. The disease occurs when the immune system produces antibodies to specific proteins in the skin and mucous membranes; the cause for production of these autoantibodies is unknown. Infliximab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a chemical messenger that activates an immune response. Infliximab has been used to treat other autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of infliximab given in combination with prednisone for the treatment of adults with PV."

Early-life compartmentalization of human T cells,"Knowledge of human immune responses during early life remains sparse, owing to the difficulty and impracticality of obtaining blood and tissue samples from infants. Our current view of normal infant immune responses, including T cell differentiation and function, is based mainly on the sampling of umbilical cord blood or fetal tissue, which reflect immune responses in utero but not responses to the diverse antigens encountered in early life. Fundamental information about the establishment of adaptive immunity during infancy, including how T cells respond, differentiate and populate tissue sites, remains undefined. Through collaboration with organ procurement agencies, we have established protocols for obtaining lymphoid and mucosal tissues from individual organ donors for whom consent has been given for the use of tissues for research."

An Interactive Reference Framework for Modeling a Dynamic Immune System,"We leveraged mass cytometry, a platform that allows measurement of multiple parameters simultaneously at the single-cell level, to initiate a reference map of the immune system. By combining the throughput of flow cytometry with the resolution of mass spectrometry, this hybrid technology enables the simultaneous quantification of 40 parameters in single cells. Use of mass cytometry allows fluorophore reporters to be replaced with isotopically-pure, stable heavy metal ions conjugated to antibodies or affinity reagents. These reporter ions are then quantified by time-of-flight mass spectrometry to provide single-cell measurements, enabling a more detailed characterization of complex cellular systems for a robust reference map."
Adjuvanted influenza-H1N1 vaccination reveals lymphoid signatures of age-dependent early responses and of clinical adverse events.,"Adjuvanted vaccines afford invaluable protection against disease, and the molecular and cellular changes they induce offer direct insight into human immunobiology. Here we show that within 24 h of receiving adjuvanted swine flu vaccine, healthy individuals made expansive, complex molecular and cellular responses that included overt lymphoid as well as myeloid contributions. Unexpectedly, this early response was subtly but significantly different in people older than _35 years. Wide-ranging adverse clinical events can seriously confound vaccine adoption, but whether there are immunological correlates of these is unknown. Here we identify a molecular signature of adverse events that was commonly associated with an existing B cell phenotype. Thus immunophenotypic variation among healthy humans may be manifest in complex pathophysiological responses."
Generation of human long-lived plasma cells by developmentally regulated epigenetic imprinting,"Antibody secreting cells (ASCs) circulate after vaccination and infection and migrate to the BM where a subset known as long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) persists and secrete antibodies for a lifetime. The mechanisms by which circulating ASCs become LLPCs are not well elucidated. Here, we show that human blood ASCs have distinct morphology, transcriptomes, and epigenetics compared with BM LLPCs. Compared with blood ASCs, BM LLPCs have decreased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio but increased endoplasmic reticulum and numbers of mitochondria. LLPCs up-regulate pro-survival genes MCL1, BCL2, and BCL-XL while simultaneously down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes HRK1, CASP3, and CASP8 Consistent with reduced gene expression, the pro-apoptotic gene loci are less accessible in LLPCs. Of the pro-survival genes, only BCL2 is concordant in gene up-regulation and loci accessibility. Using a novel in vitro human BM mimetic, we show that blood ASCs undergo similar morphological and molecular changes that resemble ex vivo BM LLPCs. Overall, our study demonstrates that early-minted blood ASCs in the BM microniche must undergo morphological, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes to mature into apoptotic-resistant LLPCs."
Role of Transcriptomics of Acute DENV-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Disease Severity,"To improve the understanding of the relative part of adaptive immunity in disease protection and immunopathology, CD3+CD8+ T-cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients hospitalized with either dengue fever (DF) or the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Samples were taken at the time of admission and discharge and the transcriptomic profiles were determined by RNA sequencing to determine differences correlating with disease severity."
Longitudinal analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seroprevalence using multiple serology platforms,"Current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests are based on the full-length spike (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrates. Here, we used samples from healthcare workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using a research-grade RBD and spike-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a commercial RBD and spike-based ELISA, and a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Seroprevalence ranged around 28% early during the pandemic and a good correlation was observed between RBD and spike-based ELISAs. Modest correlations were observed between NP and both RBD and spike-based assays. The antibody levels in HCWs declined over time; however, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD and spike-based assays remained unchanged, while the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Moreover, RBD and spike-based assays effectively detected seroconversion in vaccinees. Overall, our results consolidate the strength of different serological assays to assess the magnitude and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2."
Prior dengue virus infection and risk of Zika: a pediatric cohort in Nicaragua,"We describe the introduction of ZIKV into the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study, a long-standing pediatric dengue cohort established in 2004 in Managua, Nicaragua, in which the DENV immune history of the participants is well-characterized. The incidence of symptomatic and inapparent ZIKV infections in 2016 was estimated, together with associated demographic risk factors. The effect of previous DENV infection on ZIKV infection and disease was also analyzed. Data are available upon request (eharris@berkeley.edu), as is required by the IRB-approved protocol for the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study. The materials and data used in this study are covered by standard material transfer agreements."
Allele-specific expression changes dynamically during T cell activation in HLA and other autoimmune loci,"Here we characterized the dynamics of genetic regulatory effects at eight time points during memory CD4+ T cell activation with high depth RNA-seq in healthy individuals. We discovered widespread dynamic allele-specific expression across the genome, where the balance of alleles changes over time, in 356 SNPs spanning 186 genes. These genes were four fold enriched in autoimmune loci. We found pervasive dynamic regulatory effects within six HLA genes, particularly for a major autoimmune risk gene, HLA-DQB1."
Transcriptome and Regulatory Maps of Decidua-derived Stromal Cells Inform Gene Discovery in Preterm Birth,"While a genetic component of preterm birth (PTB) has long been recognized and recently mapped by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the molecular determinants underlying PTB remain elusive. This stems in part from an incomplete availability of comprehensive functional genomic annotations in human cell types relevant to pregnancy and PTB. Here, we generated extensive transcriptional and chromatin annotations of cultured primary decidua-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and in vitro differentiated decidual stromal cells (DSCs) and developed a computational framework to integrate these functional annotations with results from a GWAS of gestational duration in 56,384 women. This resulted in a significant enrichment of heritability estimates in functional noncoding regions in stromal cells, as well as in the discovery of additional loci associated with gestational duration and target genes of associated loci."
Effects of tissue localization on Natural Killer (NK) cell phenotypic and functional diversity,"Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigated how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human Natural Killer (NK) cells, innate lymphocytes important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high-dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue sites from 59 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation and function across age and between diverse individuals. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen and lungs, exhibiting shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity prevail in lymph nodes and intestines, exhibiting tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue-resident populations, while mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites."
Production of the Receptor-binding Domain of the Viral Spike Proteins from 2003 and 2019 SARS CoVs and the Four Common Human Coronaviruses for Serologic Assays and Inhibitor Screening,"The recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein from SARS-CoV-1 and 2 are reliable antigens for detecting viral-specific antibodies in humans. We and others have shown that the levels of RBD-binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients are correlated. Here, we report the expression and purification of properly folded RBD proteins from SARS and common-cold HCoVs in mammalian cells. RBD proteins were produced with cleavable tags for affinity purification from the cell culture medium and to support multiple immunoassay platforms and drug discovery efforts.

T and B Cell Responses across Autoimmune Diseases,"This is a non-randomized, multi-center study in which 280 participants who are healthy or have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of type 1diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis (Ps), Crohns disease (CD), or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be asked to donate a blood sample. Approximately 80 healthy adult controls and at least 40 participants per disease group with confirmed diagnosis will be analyzed. No follow-ups are planned. The study aims to establish whether defects in T and B cell function are shared across multiple immune-mediated diseases and whether these are driven by shared genetic risk variants. We will deeply immunophenotype T and B cells from each donor and correlate differences to variants known to drive immune disease risk. We will also investigate one putative disease pathway the IL23R signaling cascade in more detail to establish whether alterations to this function are present in multiple diseases."
Large-scale placenta DNA methylation mega-analysis on fetal sex,"Although male-female differences in placental structure and function have been observed, little is understood about their molecular underpinnings. Here, we present a mega-analysis of 14 publicly available placenta DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray datasets to identify individual CpGs and regions associated with fetal sex. In the discovery dataset of placentas fromFull term pregnancies (N = 532 samples), 5,212 CpGs met genome-wide significance (p < 1E-8) and were enriched in pathways such as keratinization (FDR p-value = 7.37E-14), chemokine activity (FDR p-value = 1.56E-2), and eosinophil migration (FDR p-value = 1.83E-2). Nine DMRs were identified (fwerArea < 0.1) including a region in the promoter of ZNF300 that showed consistent differential DNAm in samples from earlier timepoints in pregnancy and appeared to be driven predominately by effects in the trophoblast cell type. We describe the largest study of fetal sex differences in placenta DNAm performed to date, revealing genes and pathways characterizing sex-specific placenta function and health outcomes later in life."
"Enhanced neutralization resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.4.6, BF.7, and BA.2.75.2","The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of several new Omicron subvariants, including BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.4.6, BF.7, and BA.2.75.2. Here, we examine the neutralization resistance of these subvariants against sera from 3-dose vaccinated healthcare workers, hospitalized BA.1-wave patients, and BA.4/5-wave patients. We found enhanced neutralization resistance in all new subvariants, especially in the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants driven by N460K and K444T mutations, as well as the BA.2.75.2 subvariant driven largely by its F486S mutation. All Omicron subvariants maintained their weakened infectivity in Calu-3 cells, with the F486S mutation driving further diminished titer for the BA.2.75.2 subvariant. Molecular modeling revealed the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immune evasion by R346T, K444T, F486S, and D1199N mutations. Altogether, these findings shed light on the evolution of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants."
In vitro and in vivo functions of SARS-CoV-2 infection-enhancing and neutralizing antibodies,"SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19. A concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-? (Fc?R)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated Fc?R-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Three of 46 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can rarely occur in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques."

RG-HRV16 Inoculum Dose Determination,"The study will have a single-blind, 5+5 design for dose finding with dose de-escalation with a maximum of 4 groups of up to 10 healthy, HRV16 seronegative adult subjects inoculated with either placebo or a dose of 100, 500, 1000 or 10,000 TCD50 of RG-HRV16. Household or close contacts of research subjects will be invited to join in a surveillance portion of the protocol in order to obtain safety information on the transmission and severity of RG-HRV16 colds."
Unique transcriptomic landscapes identified in isPTB  and infectiion-PTB/AHC,"The study compared placental villous transcriptomes from carefully phenotyped cohorts of PTB due to infection or isPTB (idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth) between 28?36 weeks gestation and healthy term placentas. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a unique expression signature for isPTB, which included three upregulated IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6), supporting a role for aberrant IGF signaling in isPTB, and secondary signatures of inflammatory markers including TNC, C3, CFH, and C1R, which have been associated with placental maturity. In contrast, the expression signature of the PTB-infection cohort included upregulation of proliferative genes along with cell cycling and mitosis pathways. Together, these data suggest an isPTB molecular signature of placental hypermaturity, likely contributing to the premature activation of inflammatory pathways associated with birth and providing a molecular basis for idiopathic spontaneous birth"
"Neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike in COVID-19 patients, health care workers, and convalescent plasma donors","Rapid and specific antibody testing is crucial for improved understanding, control, and treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Herein, we describe and apply a rapid, sensitive, and accurate virus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The assay is based on an HIV-1 lentiviral vector that contains a secreted intron Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) or secreted nano-luciferase reporter cassette, pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, and is validated with a plaque-reduction assay using an authentic, infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain. The assay was used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum from individuals with a broad range of COVID-19 symptoms; patients included those in the intensive care unit (ICU), health care workers (HCWs), and convalescent plasma donors. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were observed among ICU patients, followed by general hospitalized patients, HCWs, and convalescent plasma donors. Our study highlights a wide phenotypic variation in human antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrates the efficacy of a potentially novel lentivirus pseudotype assay for high-throughput serological surveys of neutralizing antibody titers in large cohorts."
Correlates of Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 in Rhesus Macaques,"Recent studies have reported protective efficacy of both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge in rhesus macaques. However, the importance of humoral and cellular immunity for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined. Here we show that adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects naive recipient rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. These findings have important implications for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and immune-based therapeutics."
Microbial-driven preterm labour involves crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune response,"There has been a surge in studies implicating a role of vaginal microbiota in spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), but most are associative without mechanistic insight. Here we show a comprehensive approach to understand the causative factors of preterm birth, based on the integration of longitudinal vaginal microbiota and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) immunophenotype data collected from 133 women at high-risk of sPTB. We show that vaginal depletion of Lactobacillus species and high bacterial diversity leads to increased mannose binding lectin (MBL), IgM, IgG, C3b, C5, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1? and to increased risk of sPTB. Cervical shortening, which often precedes preterm birth, is associated with Lactobacillus iners and elevated levels of IgM, C3b, C5, C5a and IL-6. These data demonstrate a role for the complement system in microbial-driven sPTB and provide a scientific rationale for the development of live biotherapeutics and complement therapeutics to prevent sPTB."
Durable Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses 8 Months after Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination,"These data show that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine elicited durable humoral and cellular immune responses with minimal decreases for at least 8 months after immunization. In addition, we observed an expansion of neutralizing antibody breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants over this time period, including against the more transmissible B.1.617.2 variant and the partially neutralization-resistant B.1.351 and P.1 variants, which suggests maturation of B-cell responses even without further boosting. The durability of immune responses elicited by the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was consistent with the durability recently reported for an Ad26-based Zika vaccine.4 Longitudinal antibody responses to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have also been reported for 6 months but with different kinetics of decreasing titers.5 The durability of humoral and cellular immune responses 8 months after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination with increased neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants over time, including after single-shot vaccination, further supports the use of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine to combat the global Covid-19 pandemic."
ADVN Biomarker Registry Study,"This protocol describes the development of the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Immunization Network (ADVN) Biomarker Registry Study. The proposed Registry is a database with a minimum of 1,000 subjects who have voluntarily agreed to provide medical and demographic information about themselves and their health status.These data will be collected until a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the end of the funding cycle to allow for final data entry, query resolution, and database lock and will be used to identify potential subjects for future studies designed to improve scientific understanding of the increased risk of complications after exposure to the smallpox vaccine for people with atopic dermatitis (AD).In addition, enrolled subjects will be asked to provide a blood sample for evaluation of biomarkers, and permission for blood sample storage to support future analyses. Provision of a blood sample for evaluation of biomarkers for future analyses will be optional for subjects under 6 years of age."
Zoster vaccine in young and elderly,"Study objective: To analyze the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the magnitude of the adaptive immune responses (by gamma-interferon ELISPOT, responder-cell frequency (RCF) and flow cytometric studies) in young and elderly populations in order to identify the correlation signatures of the innate immune responses to Zoster vaccine.Study design: Double center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers will be vaccinated with Zoster vaccine. Blood samples will be collected during a screening visit (between days D-56 to D-14) D0 (at vaccination) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D90 and D180 post vaccination to study innate and adaptive immunity responses. Even though Zoster vaccine is considered safe, volunteers are asked to report and record any local or systemic AEs for 7 days post-vaccination. Also AEs will be reported for 30 days post-vaccination any SAE for 180 days post vaccination. AEs developing the day of the blood draw will also be reported"
Immune response of patients during pregnancy,"To study whether the different trimesters in a unique hormone environment are associated with...(a) Identifiable, discrete changes in maternal systemic immunity and/or(b) recognizable alterations in susceptibility to select biodefense pathogens.By challenging patient's cells with chimeric NDV viruses the study will investigate immune antagonists from category A-C pathogens and determine whether pregnancy changes in immune responses may lead to more profound pathogen specific immunodeficiency.NK, T, plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells will be evaluated without stimulation as well as evaluated in experiments after virus challenge. Cytokine and chemokine expression will also be assessed to determine whether cytokine expression patterns can be predicted in an individual and whether a specific pattern of cytokine expression is related to gestational age."
"Next Generation Sequencing RNA Seq data from UKE Phase I rVSV ZEBOV vaccine clinical trial, from full blood samples on Days 0,1,3,7","10 adult participants of dose group 3x10^6 pfu, and 10 participants of dose group 20x10^6 pfu. Reads were aligned to the human reference assembly (GRCh38.p7) using STAR software (v2.4.2a; option '--quantMode GeneCounts'). Gene annotation was obtained from Ensembl (release 79, ensemble.org). VOOM+Limma analysis (R software, version 3.2.2) was used to assess differential gene expression at each post-vaccination day (d1, d3 and d7) against baseline (d0). Next, we intergreted gene expression data and antibody response using an sPLS algorithm, in order to down-select genes correlating with multivariate antibody responses at days 28, 54, 84,180."
"Systems Biology Approach to Study Influenza Vaccine 2011-12 in Healthy Children (see companion studies SDY364, SDY368, SDY387, SDY522)","The treatment of pediatric immune system dysfunctions depends upon the basic understanding of its molecular and cellular components, as well as the inherent relationships between these components. Specifically, such knowledge requires an appreciation of B-Iymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. Research investigating these cells and their functions necessitates the availability and acquisition of peripheral blood samples from healthy children to form control data groups against which various experimental conditions can be measured. Volunteers will be asked to donate blood samples to be used to further study the circulating dendritic cell subpopulations and establish their normal ranges. Blood samples will also be used to isolate antigen specific T lymphocytes, serve as a monocyte source and establish gene signatures. The assay results from SDY144's EXP13603, EXP11769, and EXP13604 are the same as for this study. The difference is how the floe cytometry results were analyzed in this study versus SDY144."
Transcriptomes From Human Tissue Biopsies During Pregnancy,"Spontaneous preterm labor is one of the leading causes of preterm birth and is associated with pathological changes in both the uterine myometrium and cervix The aim of this study was to understand how these changes occur at a cellular level. Samples of 310 single cell transcriptomes were derived from biopsies of tissues obtained from 4 pregnant women in their third trimester that underwent planned cesarean hysterectomies because of suspected morbidly adherent placentas. Using single cell transcriptomic analyses, different cell types obtained from cervical and uterine biopsies during late pregnancy were delineated using marker genes. Expressed genes were cross validated using the Human Protein Atlas. The cells were separated into 5 major groups using unbiased clustering of marker genes: endothelial, leukocytes, epithelial, smooth muscle, and stromal cells. Genes that separated the different cell types were observed to be genes whose coordinated expression drives that cell types specific biological function. In addition to cell type specific genes, enriched expression of genes implicated in active inflammatory processes were also observed. The single cell catalogue created during this study gives a deeper understanding of pathologies that occur during childbirth, including preterm births."
Direct on-swab metabolic profiling of vaginal microbiome host interactions,"The pregnancy vaginal microbiome contributes to risk of preterm birth, the primary cause of death in children under 5 years of age. Here we describe direct on-swab metabolic profiling by Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) for sample preparation-free characterisation of the cervicovaginal metabolome in two independent pregnancy cohorts (VMET, n?=?160; 455 swabs; VMET II, n?=?205; 573 swabs). By integrating metataxonomics and immune profiling data from matched samples, we show that specific metabolome signatures can be used to robustly predict simultaneously both the composition of the vaginal microbiome and host inflammatory status. In these patients, vaginal microbiota instability and innate immune activation, as predicted using DESI-MS, associated with preterm birth, including in women receiving cervical cerclage for preterm birth prevention. These findings highlight direct on-swab metabolic profiling by DESI-MS as an innovative approach for preterm birth risk stratification through rapid assessment of vaginal microbiota-host dynamics."
Tissue adaptation and clonal segregation of human memory T cells in barrier sites,"T lymphocytes migrate to barrier sites after exposure to pathogens providing localized immunity and long-term protection. Here, we obtained tissues from human organ donors to examine T cells across major barrier sites (skin, lung, jejunum), associated lymph nodes, lymphoid organs (spleen, bone marrow), and in circulation. By integrating single-cell protein and transcriptome profiling, we demonstrate that human barrier sites contain tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that exhibit site-adapted profiles for residency, homing, and function distinct from circulating memory T cells. Incorporating T cell receptor and transcriptome analysis, we show that circulating memory T cells are highly expanded, display extensive overlap between sites, and exhibit effector and cytolytic functional profiles, while TRM clones exhibit site-specific expansions and distinct functional capacities. Together, our findings indicate that circulating T cells are more disseminated and differentiated, while TRM exhibit tissue-specific adaptation and clonal segregation, suggesting that strategies to promote barrier immunity require tissue-targeting."
Adverse Events After SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunosuppressive and biologic therapies were largely excluded from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA vaccine trials. We evaluated adverse events (AE) after messenger RNA vaccination in 246 adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AEs were more common among younger patients and those with previous COVID-19. AEs were less common in individuals receiving advanced therapies with biologics or small-molecule inhibitors. Those with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases can be reassured that the AE risk is likely not increased, and may be reduced, while on advanced therapies."
Sex Differences in Lung Imaging and SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses in a COVID-19 Golden Syrian Hamster Model,"In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more severe outcomes are reported in males than in females, including hospitalizations and deaths. Animal models can provide an opportunity to mechanistically interrogate causes of sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8 to 10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developed more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovered more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary cytokine concentrations, including interferon-? (IFN-?"
Reduced pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in hamsters,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has proven to be highly transmissible and has outcompeted the Delta variant in many regions of the world. Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here, we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods: Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings: Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4%-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10%-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions: These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection, but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease, compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants."

SR Tacrolimus Safety and PK Study in Healthy Subjects,"This is a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, first-in-human study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sustained-release (SR) tacrolimus, which will be administered as a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg by subcutaneous (SC) injection in 8 healthy subjects. Following a screening period, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU). On Day 1 subjects will receive a single injection of SR tacrolimus. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least 24-hours postdose for collection of serial blood samples for PK analysis and safety monitoring until discharge on Day 2. Subjects will return to the clinic for PK and safety evaluations for 60 days postdose."
Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus,"Limited initial supply of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine raises the question of how to prioritize available doses. We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts."
Noninvasive Monitoring in Kidney Transplantation (CTOT-01),"This is a non randomized observational study to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a panel of noninvasive monitoring tests as correlates with acute rejection, graft loss, deterioration of renal function, and degree of graft fibrosis in renal allograft recipients receiving commonly used immunosuppressive regimens."
Orban ITN012AI: Evaluation of Diabetes Vaccine IBC-VSO1 in Newly Diagnosed Diabetics,"This study will evaluate whether IBC-VSO1 vaccine, a synthetic metabolically inactive form of insulin designed to prevent pancreatic beta-cell destruction, protects against autoimmune attack in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients. Halting beta-cell destruction may result in a prolonged remission and subsequent delay in diabetes related complications. Patients in this study must have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes no more than 3 months prior to study enrollment."
Observational Study of Alloimmunity in Cardiac Transplant Recipients (CTOT-05),"A major cause of heart transplant failure is the blockage of blood flow from lesions caused by ongoing injury and repair of the graft by the host's immune system. However, the role of T cells, antibodies, and other parts of the recipient's immune system are not well understood in transplant injury. Currently, there are no effective, noninvasive ways to detect or predict how an individual's immune system will react to a transplant. The purpose of this study is to correlate current noninvasive monitoring tests with long-term graft survival and function, and determine which tests are the most accurate predictors of this survival."
YFV integrated mulitlineage and polyfunctional responses,"Correlates of immune-mediated protection to most viral and cancer vaccines are still unknown. This impedes the development of novel vaccines to incurable diseases such as HIV and cancer. In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response. These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system. peripheral blood samples from human newborns"
T and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,"Understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important for vaccine development, interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis, and calibration of pandemic control measures. Using HLA class I and II predicted peptide megapools, circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA titers against the spike protein were determined."
Cervicovaginal Microbiota and Local Immune Response Modulate the Risk of Spontaneous Preterm Delivery,"Failure to predict and understand the causes of preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, have limited effective interventions and therapeutics. From a cohort of 2000 pregnant women, we performed a nested case control study on 107 well-phenotyped cases of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) and 432 women delivering at term. Using innovative Bayesian modeling of cervicovaginal microbiota, seven bacterial taxa were significantly associated with increased risk of sPTB, with a stronger effect in African American women. However, higher vaginal levels of beta-defensin-2 lowered the risk of sPTB associated with cervicovaginal microbiota in an ethnicity-dependent manner. Surprisingly, even in Lactobacillus spp. dominated cervicovaginal microbiota, low beta-defensin-2 was associated with increased risk of sPTB. These findings hold promise for diagnostics to accurately identify women at risk for sPTB early in pregnancy. Therapeutic strategies could include immune modulators and microbiome-based therapeutics to reduce this significant health burden."
An Inflammatory Cytokine Signature Predicts Covid-19 Severity And Survival,"Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-1b in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York."
Relaxed constraint and functional divergence of PGR,"To resolve existing conflicting data on progesterone receptor gene (PGR) evolution, the study assembled a dataset of 119 Eutherian PGRs and used a suite of maximum likelihood-based methods to characterize the strength and direction of selection acting on PGR. The result shows that PGR evolved rapidly in the human lineage (as well as other Catarrhine primates), which likely reflects an episode of relaxed selection intensity rather than positive selection. Coincident with the episode of relaxed selection intensity, ancestral sequence resurrection and functional tests indicate that the major human PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) evolved divergent functions in the human stem-lineage. These results suggest that the regulation of progesterone signaling by PR-A and PR-B may also have diverged in the human lineage and that non-human animal models of progesterone signaling may not faithfully recapitulate human biology"
Protective efficacy of rhesus adenovirus COVID-19 vaccines against mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has sparked intense interest in the rapid development of vaccines as well as animal models to evaluate vaccine candidates and to define immune correlates of protection. We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice."
Immunological memory to common cold coronaviruses assessed longitudinally over a three-year period pre-COVID19 pandemic,"The immune memory to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) influences SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, and understanding its effect is crucial for pan-coronavirus vaccine development. We performed a longitudinal analysis of pre-COVID19-pandemic samples from 2016-2019 in young adults and assessed CCC-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. Notably, CCC responses were commonly detected with comparable frequencies as with other common antigens and were sustained over time. CCC-specific CD4+ T cell responses were associated with low HLA-DR+CD38+ signals, and their magnitude did not correlate with yearly CCC infection prevalence. Similarly, CCC-specific and spike RBD-specific IgG responses were stable in time. Finally, high CCC-specific CD4+ T cell reactivity, but not antibody titers, was associated with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These results provide a valuable reference for understanding the immune response to endemic coronaviruses and suggest that steady and sustained CCC responses are likely from a stable pool of memory CD4+ T cells due to repeated earlier exposures and possibly occasional reinfections."
Treatment of MS with Copaxone and Albuterol (AMS01),"MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by focal T cell and macrophage infiltrates that lead to demyelination and loss of neurologic function. Four therapies are currently approved for the treatment of MS. Three of these are approved for the treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting (RR) form of MS, in which patients have clinical exacerbations followed by partial or complete recovery of function. These treatments are only modestly effective and are associated with significant toxicity, often causing patients to delay therapy for significant lengths of time. Thus, there is a need to find therapies with low toxicities that can be administered early during the disease course with the potential for arresting the disease."
Systems scale interactive exploration reveals quantitative and qualitative differences in response to 2009-2010 Fluzone influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine,"Systems immunology approaches were employed to investigate innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. These two non-live vaccines show different magnitudes of transcriptional responses at different time points af- ter vaccination. Software solutions were developed to explore correlates of vaccine efficacy measured as antibody titers at day 28. These enabled a further dissection of transcriptional responses. Thus, the innate response, measured within hours in the peripheral blood, was dominated by an interferon transcriptional signature after influenza vaccination and by an inflammation signature after pneumo- coccal vaccination. Day 7 plasmablast responses induced by both vaccines was more pronounced after pneumococcal vaccination. Together, these results suggest that comparing global immune responses elicited by different vaccines will be critical to our understanding of the immune mechanisms underpinning successful vaccination."

Optimization of Belatacept Usage As A Means of Avoiding CNI and steroids in Renal Transplantation (CTOT-10),"Dialysis or kidney transplant are the two ways to treat kidney failure. Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who undergo a kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives. Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications that work just as well, but don't damage the kidney."
Optimization of NULOJIX (Belatacept) Usage as a Means of Minimizing CNI Exposure in Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney Transplantation (CTOT-15),"Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune systems (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new organs. Most patients who receive a transplanted organ must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the transplanted organ continues to work. Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including pancreas and kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications that work just as well, but could lessen the amount of anti-rejection medications that are taken long term."

Each center will complete a retrospective chart review for the selected clinical variables identified in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1), and enter the data in the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SACCC) electronic data capture system."
Maternal immune response and placental antibody transfer after COVID-19 vaccination across trimester and platforms,"Here, we characterize the antibody profile after Ad26.COV2.S, mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccination in 158 pregnant individuals and evaluate transplacental antibody transfer by profiling maternal and umbilical cord blood in 175 maternal-neonatal dyads. These analyses reveal lower vaccine-induced functions and Fc receptor-binding after Ad26.COV2.S compared to mRNA vaccination and subtle advantages in titer and function with mRNA-1273 versus BN162b2. mRNA vaccines have higher titers and functions against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. First and third trimester vaccination results in enhanced maternal antibody-dependent NK-cell activation, cellular and neutrophil phagocytosis, and complement deposition relative to second trimester. Higher transplacental transfer ratios following first and second trimester vaccination may reflect placental compensation for waning maternal titers."
"Integrated plasma proteomic and single-cell immune signaling network signatures demarcate mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19","The biological determinants underlying the range of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations are not fully understood. Here, over 1,400 plasma proteins and 2,600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, endogenous signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands are cross-sectionally assessed in peripheral blood from 97 patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 and 40 uninfected patients. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identify and independently validate a multi-variate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class area under the curve [AUC]training = 0.799, p = 4.2e-6; multi-class AUCvalidation = 0.773, p = 7.7e-6). Examination of informative model features reveals biological signatures of COVID-19 severity, including the dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) immune signaling networks in addition to recapitulating known hallmarks of COVID-19. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 progression."
The molecular epidemiology of multiple zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the circumstances that lead to pandemics is important for their prevention. Here, we analyze the genomic diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted A and B. Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October-8 December), while the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans prior to November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events."
The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 is critical to preventing zoonotic outbreaks before they become the next pandemic. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports but later this conclusion became controversial. We show the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and, within the market, SARS-CoV-2-positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. While there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred via the live wildlife trade in China, and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Optimizing prevalence estimates for a novel pathogen by reducing uncertainty in test characteristics,"Emergence of a novel pathogen drives the urgent need for diagnostic tests that can aid in defining disease prevalence. The limitations associated with rapid development and deployment of these tests result in a dilemma: In efforts to optimize prevalence estimates, would tests be better used in the lab to reduce uncertainty in test characteristics or to increase sample size in field studies? Here, we provide a framework to address this question through a joint Bayesian model that simultaneously analyzes lab validation and field survey data, and we define the impact of test allocation on inferences of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. In many scenarios, prevalence estimates can be most improved by apportioning additional effort towards validation rather than to the field. The joint model provides superior estimation of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, compared with typical analyses that model lab and field data separately, and it can be used to inform sample allocation when testing is limited."
T cell responses to H1N1v and a longitudinal study of seasonal influenza vaccination (TIV) SLVP015 2008 (See companion studies SDY315 2012 / SDY312 2009 / SDY311 2010 / SDY112 2011),"Systems biology approach to examine effects of seasonal flu vaccination in adults of different ages on gene expression, cytokine stimulation and serum cytokines with parameters such as immune senescence to uncover new markers and mechanisms behind failure of immune function in many older people."
Toward more predictable birthdays,"Low-cost methods for monitoring fetal development could improve prenatal care, especially in low-resource settings. By measuring the levels of certain placental RNA transcripts in maternal blood, Ngo et al. developed two noninvasive blood tests that provide a window into the progression of individual pregnancies. In a small proof-of-concept study, the first blood test predicted fetal age and delivery date with an accuracy comparable to that of ultrasound. The second blood test, also examined in a small pilot study, discriminated women at risk of preterm delivery from those who delivered at full term. The next step will be to assess the reliability of the tests in large, blinded clinical trials."
Profiling of NK cell ligands on monocytes infected with Influenza A virus,"Goal for the study was to identify NK cell ligands regulated by influenza A virus infection. More specifically we asked whether A/California/07/2009 or A/Victoria/361/2011 virus influenza A viruses differentially modulate NK cell ligands. Using 9 healthy Stanford blood bank donors, we isolated monocytes and NK cells. Monocytes were infected for 1 hr, followed by co-culture with NK cells for 6 or 23 hr hours. Brefeldin adn Monenin were added for the last 4 hours. They were then stained with a CyTOF panel and run on a Helios Mass cytometer. Two major ligands we found that contributed to the variance between the two strains were CD54 and CD112."

Mid-gestation serum lipidomic profile of PTB are influenced by BMI,"BMIs is one of risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). To identify BMI-associated metabolic perturbations and potential mid-gestation serum biomarkers of sPTB, the study compared metabolomics/lipidomics in sPTB and FTB (Full term birth) women stratified by BMIs categories: underweight, normal weight, and obese. Technique: combining untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics with targeted metabolic profiling of major regulators of inflammation and metabolism, including oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids and ceramides. Results: 1) underweight/sPTB showed dyslipidemia characterized by elevated phospholipids, unsaturated triglycerides, sphingomyelins, cholesteryl esters and long-chain acylcarnitines. 2) normalweight/sPTB showed altered relative abundance of 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids to other regioisomers at mid-pregnancy. 3) obese/sPTB: showed elevated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia characterized by elevated serum free fatty acids. In conclusion, using metabolomics can distinct BMI-dependent metabolic manifestations among women who had sPTB"
Efficacy of clinical evaluations for COVID-19 on the front line,"We conducted a retrospective review of patients assessed for possible COVID-19 illness at our urban medical center in Los Angeles, California. We carefully reviewed all clinical records to ascertain the provider's level of clinical suspicion for COVID-19 illness and compared these assessments with available results of SARS-CoV-2 testing, in addition to longitudinal data on clinical outcomes. We found that the vast majority of patients (96% of N = 25) clinically assessed to have a low probability of COVID-19 illness were subsequently confirmed to have either a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result or, in the absence of testing, clinical stability without any further concern for COVID-19 illness. All clinical assessments were performed by a physician, with some (16%) conducted by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant in conjunction with physician supervision."
Serological analysis reveals an imbalanced IgG subclass composition associated with COVID-19 disease severity,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide spectrum of disease presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity and the levels of circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, including virus-neutralizing titers. A serological analysis of 536 convalescent healthcare workers reveals that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels are elevated in individuals that experience severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody is dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), with an IgG subclass ratio skewed toward elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. In addition, individuals that experience severe disease show elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody binding to the inflammatory receptor Fc?RIIIa. Based on these correlational studies, we propose that spike-specific IgG subclass utilization may contribute to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results may have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and convalescent plasma therapy."
Estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and epidemiological parameters with uncertainty from serological surveys,"Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions."
Meta-Analysis of Vaginal Microbiome Data Provides New Insights On Preterm Birth,"Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as the birth of an infant before 37 weeks of gestational age. It is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 15 million preterm births per year. Vaginal microbiome more specifically is known to change throughout pregnancy, and can even affect the fetus before delivery. This study presents the first meta-analysis of vaginal microbiome in preterm birth. This study integrated raw 16S ribosomal RNA vaginal microbiome data from three pregnancy related studies consisting of over 300 pregnant patients sampled longitudinally over the three trimesters. It was found that women who later have a preterm delivery, have a higher variance in their vaginal microbiome, with the largest, most significant difference between term and preterm patients being in samples collected during the first trimester. While several of the microbial genera have been reported previously, three of those nine microbial genera are newly reported here. New hypotheses emerging from such an integrative analysis can lead to novel diagnostics to identify women who are at higher risk for PTB and potentially inform new therapeutic interventions."
mRNA vaccines induce rapid antibody responses in mice,"mRNA vaccines can be developed and produced quickly, making them prime candidates for immediate outbreak responses. Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated rapid protection following mRNA vaccination. Thus, we sought to investigate how quickly mRNA vaccines elicit antibody responses compared to other vaccine modalities. We first compared the immune kinetics of mRNA and DNA vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike in mice. We observed rapid induction of antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies by day 5 following mRNA (4??g/mouse), but not DNA (50??g/mouse), immunization. Comparing innate responses hours post immunization, the mRNA vaccine induced increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, and MCP-1 cytokines which maybe promoting humoral responses downstream. We then evaluated the immune kinetics of an HIV-1 mRNA vaccine in comparison to DNA, protein, and rhesus adenovirus 52 (RhAd52) vaccines of the same HIV-1 envelope antigen in mice. Again, induction of envelope-specific antibodies was observed by day 5 following mRNA vaccination, whereas antibodies were detected by day 7?14 following DNA, protein, and RhAd52 vaccination. Thus, eliciting rapid humoral immunity may be a unique and advantageous property of mRNA vaccines for controlling infectious disease outbreaks."
Genotype Polymorphism effects on Cholera Vaccine responses.,"The objective is to understand role of polymorphisms in genes of innate and adaptive immunity in modulating the response to vaccines for cholera gastrointestinal tract infections by:Collecting blood and saliva from 1000 vaccine study participants for each vaccine in Kolkata, India, at days 1, 3, and 28.Determining vaccine-specific titers using ELISA, vibriocidal, and multiplex bead antibody assays.Discover and validate SNP polymorphisms in this population and screen all participant's DNA for SNPs to 14 innate immunity genes and genome scans for adaptive immunity genes.Characterize protein/peptide expression using LC/MS, immunoassay, and flow cytometry for protein mediators of innate/adaptive immunity and 22 proteins involved in cell stimulation and signal transduction; and 2-D gel MS/MS on 100-200 proteins, protein isoforms and protein fragments to determine more generalized effects of immune activation, signal transduction and general response to vaccination.Determine haplotypes, perform association analyses between vaccine response (defined either categorically or quantitatively) and SNPs, haplotypes, or protein expression parameters, and perform association analyses between genomic and proteomic assessments.Conduct resequencing of genes with SNPs that are significantly associated to vaccine response."

DNMT3A Haploinsufficiency Transforms FLT3 ITD Myeloproliferative Disease into AML,"Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) represents nearly 50% of human AML. Co-occurring mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and the FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are common in CN-AML and confer a poorer prognosis, but the molecular mechnism of the double-mutant is unknown. By using a rapid mouse model of FLT3/DNMT3A-Mutant AML and advanced global scRNAseq and methylation profiling techniques, the study demonstrates that DNMT3A haploinsufficiency results in reversible epigenetic alterations that transform FLT3 ITD -mutant myeloproliferative neoplasm into AML."
Systems biology approach predicts immunogenicity of the yellow fever vaccine in humans,"A major challenge in vaccinology is to prospectively determine vaccine efficacy. Here we have used a systems biology approach to identify early gene signatures that predicted immune responses in humans vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine YF-17D. Vaccination induced genes that regulate virus innate sensing and type I interferon production. Computational analyses identified a gene signature, including complement protein C1qB and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 an orchestrator of the integrated stress response that correlated with and predicted YF-17D CD8+ T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an independent, blinded trial. A distinct signature, including B cell growth factor TNFRS17, predicted the neutralizing antibody response with up to 100% accuracy. These data highlight the utility of systems biology approaches in predicting vaccine efficacy."
Unconventional ST2- and CD127-negative lung ILC2 populations are induced by the fungal allergen Alternaria,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have been recognized for their ability to drive type 2 responses in experimental animal models in the absence of T cells. Mice intranasally challenged with Alternaria alternata, a fungal allergen associated with severe asthma and fatal exacerbations in humans, potently activates ILC2s via the IL-33/ST2 (IL-33R) axis to robustly secrete type 2 cytokines. Animal models, including Alternaria-induced lung inflammation in mice, have given us critical insight into pathways of ILC2 regulation that appear to apply to ILC2 responses in human disease.7 Thus, accurate identification of ILC2s in the lungs of mice is critical to future understanding of their biology and contribution to allergic disease. We assessed whether the conventional ILC2 identification markers ST2 and CD127."

Single-Dose Intranasal Administration of AdCOVID Elicits Systemic and Mucosal Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and Fully Protects Mice from Lethal Challenge,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective prophylactic vaccination to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry. The current intramuscular vaccines elicit systemic immunity but not necessarily high-level mucosal immunity. Here, we tested a single intranasal dose of our candidate adenovirus type 5-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (AdCOVID) in inbred, outbred, and transgenic mice. A single intranasal vaccination with AdCOVID elicited a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA in the respiratory tract, serum neutralizing antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. A single AdCOVID dose resulted in immunity that was sustained for over six months. Moreover, a single intranasal dose completely protected K18-hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, preventing weight loss and mortality. These data show that AdCOVID promotes concomitant systemic and mucosal immunity and represents a promising vaccine candidate."
"Immune imprinting, breadth of variant recognition, and germinal center response in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination","During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, novel and traditional vaccine strategies have been deployed globally. We investigated whether antibodies stimulated by mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2), including third-dose boosting, differ from those generated by infection or adenoviral (ChAdOx1-S and Gam-COVID-Vac) or inactivated viral (BBIBP-CorV) vaccines. We analyzed human lymph nodes after infection or mRNA vaccination for correlates of serological differences. Antibody breadth against viral variants is lower after infection compared with all vaccines evaluated but improves over several months. Viral variant infection elicits variant-specific antibodies, but prior mRNA vaccination imprints serological responses toward Wuhan-Hu-1 rather than variant antigens. In contrast to disrupted germinal centers (GCs) in lymph nodes during infection, mRNA vaccination stimulates robust GCs containing vaccine mRNA and spike antigen up to 8 weeks postvaccination in some cases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity, breadth, and maturation are affected by imprinting from exposure history and distinct histological and antigenic contexts in infection compared with vaccination."
Antigen-Specific Adaptive Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Acute COVID-19,"Limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific immune responses and COVID-19 disease severity. The adaptive immune system responds to pathogens in an antigen-specific manner to develop protective immunity. We completed a combined examination of all three branches of adaptive immunity at the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in acute and convalescent subjects, and compared the response in unexposed controls"
Durability and Cross-Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine in Adolescent Children,"Emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants and waning humoral immunity in vaccinated individuals have resulted in increased infections and hospitalizations. Children are not spared from infection nor complications of COVID-19, and the recent recommendation for boosters in individuals ages 12 years or older calls for broader understanding of the adolescent immune profile after mRNA vaccination. We tested the durability and cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses over a six-month time course in vaccinated adolescents against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G (""""wild type"""") and Omicron antigens. Serum from 77 adolescents showed that anti-Spike antibodies wane significantly over six months. After completion of a two-vaccine series, cross-reactivity against Omicron-specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) was seen. Functional humoral activation against wild type and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 also declines over time in vaccinated adolescent children. Evidence of waning mRNA-induced vaccine immunity underscores vulnerabilities in long-term pediatric protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while cross-reactivity highlights the additional benefits of vaccination. Characterization of adolescent immune signatures post-vaccination will inform guidance on vaccine platforms and timelines, and ultimately optimize immunoprotection of children."
SARS-CoV-2 transmission and impacts of unvaccinated-only screening in populations of mixed vaccination status,"Screening programs that test only the unvaccinated population have been proposed and implemented to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread, implicitly assuming that the unvaccinated population drives transmission. To evaluate this premise and quantify the impact of unvaccinated-only screening programs, we introduce a model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through which we explore a range of transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness scenarios, rates of prior infection, and screening programs. We find that, as vaccination rates increase, the proportion of transmission driven by the unvaccinated population decreases, such that most community spread is driven by vaccine-breakthrough infections once vaccine coverage exceeds 55% (omicron) or 80% (delta), points which shift lower as vaccine effectiveness wanes. Thus, we show that as vaccination rates increase, the transmission reductions associated with unvaccinated-only screening decline, identifying three distinct categories of impact on infections and hospitalizations. More broadly, these results demonstrate that effective unvaccinated-only screening depends on population immunity, vaccination rates, and variant."
Role of miR-2392 in driving SARS-CoV-2 infection,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation that have a major impact on many diseases and provide an exciting avenue toward antiviral therapeutics. From patient transcriptomic data, we determined that a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, is directly involved with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) machinery during host infection. Specifically, we show that miR-2392 is key in driving downstream suppression of mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation, glycolysis, and hypoxia, as well as promoting many symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We demonstrate that miR-2392 is present in the blood and urine of patients positive for COVID-19 but is not present in patients negative for COVID-19. These findings indicate the potential for developing a minimally invasive COVID-19 detection method. Lastly, using in vitro human and in vivo hamster models, we design a miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic that targets miR-2392, significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 viability in hamsters, and may potentially inhibit a COVID-19 disease state in humans."
Vaccination with drifted variants of H5 hemagglutinin protein elicits a broadened antibody response,"Substantial H5 influenza HA directed immunity is elicited after vaccination of human subjects who had been previously immunized with a drifted H5 HA variant. We sought to investigate the characteristics of H5 HA specific immune responses in more depth by developing an animal model of H5 HA vaccination using drift variants of recombinant H5 HA proteins. HA proteins derived from influenzas A/Vietnam/1203/04 (Clade 1) and A/Indonesia/05/05 (Clade 2.1) were chosen. The sequence of vaccination consisted of two doses of homologous protein, followed by one additional dose of the homologous or heterologous, drifted HA protein. Each dose of HA was combined with CpG as an adjuvant and was injected subcutaneously. All the animals exhibited a serum IgG antibody response that cross-reacted with both HAs in an ELISA. However, those animals that received the drifted variant exhibited higher reactivity to the heterologous HA. Competitive ELISA of serum from drift-variant recipients showed evidence of antibody focusing towards the drifted HA, suggesting modification of the response towards improved cross-reactivity, though development of neutralizing antibodies was limited. Nevertheless, animals were protected against live-virus challenge, and passive transfer of serum was sufficient to confer protection to otherwise naive mice, indicating that both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies offer some degree of protection. These findings suggest that pre-vaccination against H5 influenza has the potential to prime immunity against emerging drifted H5 strains, and could also lower the dose requirements of vaccination in the event of a pandemic."
Longitudinal metabolomics of human plasma reveals prognostic markers of COVID-19 disease severity,"There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-threatening illness so that med- ical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we perform untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 339 patients, with samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we build a predictive model of disease severity. We discover that a panel of metabolites measured at the time of study entry suc- cessfully determines disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirm that most of these markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels return to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validate that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19."
Correlates of Neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern by Early Pandemic Sera,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that overcome natural and vaccine-induced immunity threaten to exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on the cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses. IMPORTANCE Widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. NAb responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virological, immunological, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."

Response of women during pregnancy to the inactivated influenza virus vaccine,"Study volunteers will be recruited from the two obstetrical practices or the post-partum floor that are on-site at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, including the Obs/Gyn Diagnostic and Treatment Center (DTC) and Faculty Practice Associates (FPA). The DTC practice is the MSSM clinical teaching practice.All patients will be required to give three blood samples, one at the time of the first study visit, the second 1-3 month(s) later (at the time of the second study visit), and the third at the end of flu season (end of March) in order to assess the immune response to routinely administered influenza vaccination(s). Relevant medical records will be reviewed to abstract detailed information about pregnancy complications and newborn outcomes.In addition, when the study team is available, cord blood samples and placenta samples may be collected. These will be collected after specimens are processed as needed clinically and before remaining blood and tissues would otherwise be discarded."
Urinary cell mRNA profiles of rejection (CTOT-04),"This is an observational, uncontrolled and non-randomized study in which all deceased donor and living donor kidney allograft recipients at all participating centers are eligible for enrollment. The primary aims are : (1) To investigate whether the levels of mRNA encoding cytotoxic proteins perforin and granzyme B, and T cell marker CD3, are a sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic test for acute rejection in renal allografts; and (2) To determine whether mRNA profiles of sequential urine specimens predict the development of rejection. We will investigate whether mRNA profiles predict kidney graft function as assessed by estimated GFR at 12, 24 and 36 months after transplantation."
Immune Response to Yellow Fever Vaccination in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis (YF08),"The main objective of the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Network (ADVN) is to reduce the risk of eczema vaccinatum (EV) following smallpox vaccination. Since direct vaccination of atopic dermatitis (AD) subjects with live vaccinia virus (VV) is contraindicated due to the heightened risk of EV, a surrogate virus, yellow fever (YF) (the highly attenuated vaccine strain, 17D), was chosen. This is a live virus that can be administered transcutaneously (TC) with a bifurcated needle in a manner analogous to smallpox vaccination. In this study, AD subjects and controls will be vaccinated with the yellow fever virus (YFV) (YFV-17D) by the subcutaneous (SC) or TC route to determine: 1) whether there are quantitative differences in the antiviral immune responses elicited in these 2 distinct groups of subjects; and 2) whether the route of vaccination alters these immune responses, especially in AD subjects who may have altered cutaneous immunity. Using in-depth analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in AD subjects and controls, an immunological signature may be identified that would aid in the screening process of individuals who might be at risk for EV. Moreover, this study will provide substantial information about normal and defective cutaneous immunity in AD subjects, which will be critical for future development of therapeutic drugs aimed at preventing or alleviating EV, as well as other more common viral skin infections.

Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"Background: The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk change across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Antibody responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.,"In a cohort of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine recipients (n = 1,090), we observed that spike-specific IgG antibody levels and ACE2 antibody binding inhibition responses elicited by a single vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 35) were similar to those seen after two doses of vaccine in individuals without prior infection (n = 228). Post-vaccine symptoms were more prominent for those with prior infection after the first dose, but symptomology was similar between groups after the second dose."
Anti-TNF Agents in RA (ARA06),"This is a Phase IV, investigator-initiated, partially blinded, randomized, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the mechanistic effects of TNF-a inhibition on clinical and mechanistic measures in RA patients. Subjects will be randomized to one of two active treatment arms, etanercept or adalimumab, and will receive treatment using standard dosing regimens for 24 weeks. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio until 40 and 20 subjects are treated with etanercept and adalimumab, respectively. Clinical responses and serologic changes will be monitored throughout the study in all participants. Study visits are scheduled for Screening, Baseline/Treatment-Initiation, and at Weeks 12 and 24. In addition, to assess safety, blood draws are scheduled for Weeks 8 and16, and phone calls are scheduled for Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 20. In order to assess peripheral blood B and T cell changes after treatment initiation, all participating subjects will have a blood sample analyzed by flow cytometry for B and T cell subsets at Baseline/Treatment Initiation and Weeks 12 and 24. Etanercept drug levels will be assessed from samples drawn at Weeks 12 and 24 as study drug levels may impact clinical response."
"Defective signaling in aging, influenza vaccination 2007 SLVP015","Pilot year. Despite the importance of the immune system in many diseases, there are currently no objective benchmarks of immunological health. In an effort to indentify benchmarks of immunological health, influenza vaccination was used in 10 young (20-30 years) and 19 older subjects (60 to 89 years) as models for strong and weak immune responses, respectively. Serological responses to influenza strains as well as a wide variety of other parameters, including gene expression, antibodies to hemagglutinin peptides, serum cytokines, cell subset phenotypes and in vitro cytokine stimulation were measured. Using machine learning, nine variables predicting antibody response with 84% accuracy were identified. Two of these variables are involved in apoptosis, which positively associated with the response to vaccination and was confirmed to be a contributor to vaccine responsiveness in mice. The identification of these biomarkers provides new insights into what immune features may be most important for immune health."
Assessment of Postdonation Outcomes in US Living Kidney Donors Using Publicly Available Data Sets.,"Importance:There are limited resources providing postdonation conditions that can occur in living donors (LDs) of solid-organ transplant. Consequently, it is difficult to visualize and understand possible postdonation outcomes in LDs. Objective:To assemble an open access resource that is representative of the demographic characteristics in the US national registry, maintained by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and administered by the United Network for Organ Sharing, but contains more follow-up information to help to examine postdonation outcomes in LDs. Design, Setting, and Participants:Cohort study in which the data for the resource and analyses stemmed from the transplant data set derived from 27 clinical studies from the ImmPort database, which is an open access repository for clinical studies. The studies included data collected from 1963 to 2016. Data from the United Network for Organ Sharing Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network national registry collected from October 1987 to March 2016 were used to determine representativeness. Data analysis took place from June 2016 to May 2018. Data from 20 ImmPort clinical studies (including clinical trials and observational studies) were curated, and a cohort of 11 263 LDs was studied, excluding deceased donors, LDs with 95% or more missing data, and studies without a complete data dictionary. The harmonization process involved the extraction of common features from each clinical study based on categories that included demographic characteristics as well as predonation and postdonation data. Main Outcomes and Measures:Thirty-six postdonation events were identified, represented, and analyzed via a trajectory network analysis. Results:The curated data contained 10 869 living kidney donors (median [interquartile range] age, 39 [31-48] years; 6175 [56.8%] women; and 9133 [86.6%] of European descent). A total of 9558 living kidney donors with postdonation data were analyzed. Overall, 1406 LDs (14.7%) had postdonation events. The 4 most common events were hypertension (806 [8.4%]), diabetes (190 [2.0%]), proteinuria (171 [1.8%]), and postoperative ileus (147 [1.5%]). Relatively few events (n = 269) occurred before the 2-year postdonation mark. Of the 1746 events that took place 2 years or more after donation, 1575 (90.2%) were nonsurgical; nonsurgical conditions tended to occur in the wide range of 2 to 40 years after donation (odds ratio, 38.3; 95% CI, 4.12-1956.9). Conclusions and Relevance:Most events that occurred more than 2 years after donation were nonsurgical and could occur up to 40 years after donation. Findings support the construction of a national registry for long-term monitoring of LDs and confirm the value of secondary reanalysis of clinical studies."

Participants in this study will have received heart, lung, liver, or kidney transplants."
Dataset from Analysis of the Response of Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis to Oral Vitamin D3 by Measurement of Antimicrobial Peptide Expression in Skin and Saliva,This study will examine whether administration of oral Vitamin D3 given over 21 days will change the antimicrobial peptide expression in the skin or saliva of subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). This study will help researchers determine if the lack of the expression of antimicrobial peptides in individuals with AD plays a role in the susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum (EV).
The Metabolic Signature of the Placenta in SPTB,"The placenta is metabolically active and supports the growth of the fetus. We hypothesize that deficits in the capacity of the placenta to maintain bioenergetic and metabolic stability during pregnancy may result in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). To explore this hypothesis, we performed a nested cased control study of metabolomic signatures in placentas from women with SPTB (<36 weeks gestation) compared to normal pregnancies (?38 weeks gestation). To control for the effects of gestational age on placenta metabolism, we also studied a subset of metabolites in non-laboring preterm and term Rhesus monkeys. Comprehensive quantification of metabolites demonstrated a significant elevation in the levels of amino acids, prostaglandins, sphingolipids, lysolipids, and acylcarnitines in SPTB placenta compared to term placenta. Additional quantification of placental acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the significant elevation in SPTB human, with no significant differences between midgestation and term placenta in Rhesus macaque. Fatty acid oxidation as measured by the flux of 3H-palmitate in SPTB placenta was lower than term. Collectively, significant and biologically relevant alterations in the placenta metabolome were identified in SPTB placenta. Altered acylcarnitine levels and fatty acid oxidation suggest that disruption in normal substrate metabolism is associated with SPTB."
CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients recognize a conserved epitope present in diverse coronaviruses,"Recent studies have shown that vaccinated individuals harbor T cells that can cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human common cold coronaviruses. However, it is still unknown whether CD4+ T cells from vaccinated individuals recognize peptides from bat coronaviruses that may have the potential of causing future pandemics. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitope (S815-827) that is conserved in coronaviruses from different genera and subgenera, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, multiple bat coronaviruses, and a feline coronavirus. Our results showed that S815-827 was recognized by 42% of vaccinated participants in our study who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines. Using T cell expansion and T cell receptor sequencing assays, we demonstrated that S815-827-reactive CD4+ T cells from the majority of responders cross-recognized homologous peptides from at least 6 other diverse coronaviruses. Our results support the hypothesis that the current mRNA vaccines elicit T cell responses that can cross-recognize bat coronaviruses and thus might induce some protection against potential zoonotic outbreaks. Furthermore, our data provide important insights that inform the development of T cell?based pan-coronavirus vaccine strategies."
Shapiro ITN005CT:  Islet Transplantation in Type 1 Diabetic Patients,"The transplanting of islet cells has been studied in Type 1 diabetic patients whose blood sugar levels will not stay normal, despite intensive insulin therapy. A recent study conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated. This study extends the results obtained from the Edmonton study, which used islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetic patients with steroid-free immunosuppression."
