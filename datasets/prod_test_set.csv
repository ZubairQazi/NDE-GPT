0,12524544,"Nuclear export of mRNA is mediated by a complex machinery of RNA-binding proteins that recognizes and routes mRNAs through a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) network. The full spectrum of mRNA cargoes for any dedicated mRNA export factor is unknown. We identified the mRNAs that bind two conserved yeast mRNA export factors, Yra1 (refs. 1-5) and Mex67 (refs. 6,7), on a genome-wide scale and determined their level of binding. Yra1 and Mex67 bind approximately 1,000 and 1,150 mRNAs, respectively, corresponding to almost 20% of the yeast genome and roughly 36% of all transcriptional events each. The binding level of Yra1 targets is related to their transcriptional frequency, but that of Mex67 targets is not. Yra1-bound transcripts are enriched in mRNAs that are regulated by a number of transcription factors. Yra1- and Mex67-bound populations also show enrichment of mRNAs encoding distinct functional classes of proteins, some of which are regulated by these transcription factors. We determined that one such transcription factor, Abf1 (refs. 8-10), associates with Yra1. These results indicate a previously unidentified specificity of mRNA export factors, which coordinates the export of transcriptionally co-regulated, functional classes of transcripts, perhaps through interactions with the transcriptional machinery.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Cell line report', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Active site prediction', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Fungi', 'protein', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein domains', 'Protein report', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'DNA testing', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Lipoproteins', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription']"
1,14512514,"The synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, the building blocks of membranes, is regulated by three membrane-bound transcription factors: sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1a, -1c, and -2. Their function in liver has been characterized in transgenic mice that overexpress each SREBP isoform and in mice that lack all three nuclear SREBPs as a result of gene knockout of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a protein required for nuclear localization of SREBPs. Here, we use oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with RNA from livers of three lines of mice (transgenic for SREBP-1a, transgenic for SREBP-2, and knockout for SCAP) to identify genes that are likely to be direct targets of SREBPs in liver. A total of 1,003 genes showed statistically significant increased expression in livers of transgenic SREBP-1a mice, 505 increased in livers of transgenic SREBP-2 mice, and 343 showed decreased expression in Scap-/- livers. A subset of 33 genes met the stringent combinatorial criteria of induction in both SREBP transgenics and decreased expression in SCAP-deficient mice. Of these 33 genes, 13 were previously identified as direct targets of SREBP action. Of the remaining 20 genes, 13 encode enzymes or carrier proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, 3 participate in fatty acid metabolism, and 4 have no known connection to lipid metabolism. Through application of stringent combinatorial criteria, the transgenic/knockout approach allows identification of genes whose activities are likely to be controlled directly by one family of transcription factors, in this case the SREBPs.","['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cholesterol', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Exonic splicing enhancer prediction', 'Proteins', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'cis-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
2,14981237,"RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease of Escherichia coli, interacts through its C-terminal region with multiple other proteins to form a complex termed the RNA degradosome. To investigate the degradosome's proposed role as an RNA decay machine, we used DNA microarrays to globally assess alterations in the steady-state abundance and decay of 4,289 E. coli mRNAs at single-gene resolution in bacteria carrying mutations in the degradosome constituents RNase E, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RhlB helicase, and enolase. Our results show that the functions of all four of these proteins are necessary for normal mRNA turnover. We identified specific transcripts and functionally distinguishable transcript classes whose half-life and abundance were affected congruently by multiple degradosome proteins, affected differentially by mutations in degradosome constituents, or not detectably altered by degradosome mutations. Our results, which argue that decay of some E. coli mRNAs in vivo depends on the action of assembled degradosomes, whereas others are acted on by degradosome proteins functioning independently of the complex, imply the existence of structural features or biochemical factors that target specific classes of mRNAs for decay by degradosomes.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Endoribonucleases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Half-Life', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Protein domains', 'Biosciences', 'LSID', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
3,15054141,"Diminished activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. To better understand what genes are regulated by PPARgamma, an experimental data set was generated by microarray analysis, in duplicate, of pooled aortic mRNA isolated from mice treated for 21 days with a PPARgamma agonist (rosiglitazone) or vehicle. Of the 12,488 probe sets present on the array (Affymetrix MG-U74Av2), 181 were differentially expressed between groups according to a statistical metric generated using Affymetrix software. A significant correlation was observed between the microarray results and real-time RT-PCR analysis of 39 of these genes. Cluster analysis revealed 3 expression patterns, 29 transcripts of moderate abundance that were decreased (-93%) to very low levels, 106 transcripts that were downregulated (-42%), and 46 transcripts that were upregulated (+70%). Functional groups that were decreased included inflammatory response (-93%, n = 6), immune response (-86%, n = 7), and cytokines (-82%, n = 7). There was an overall upregulation in the oxidoreductase activity group (+47%, n = 9). Individually, six transcripts in this group were increased (+72%), and three were decreased (-34%). Fourteen of the genes map to regions in the rat genome that have been linked to increased blood pressure, and of 142 upstream regions analyzed, sequences resembling the DNA binding site for PPARgamma were identified in 101 of the differentially expressed genes.","['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Web portal', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'HTML', 'File name extension', 'Gap extension penalty', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
4,15129285,"The flood of high-throughput biological data has led to the expectation that computational (or in silico) models can be used to direct biological discovery, enabling biologists to reconcile heterogeneous data types, find inconsistencies and systematically generate hypotheses. Such a process is fundamentally iterative, where each iteration involves making model predictions, obtaining experimental data, reconciling the predicted outcomes with experimental ones, and using discrepancies to update the in silico model. Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in Escherichia coli, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks. We find that a systems biology approach that combines genome-scale experimentation and computation can systematically generate hypotheses on the basis of disparate data sources.","['Aerobiosis', 'Anaerobiosis', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype']","['Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Simulation', 'Simulation analysis', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data']"
5,15263007,"Vascular disruption following bony injury results in a hypoxic gradient within the wound microenvironment. Nevertheless, the effects of low oxygen tension on osteogenic precursors remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated in vitro osteoblast and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation following exposure to 21% O(2) (ambient oxygen), 2% O(2) (hypoxia), and <0.02% O(2) (anoxia). Hypoxia had little effect on osteogenic differentiation. In contrast, short-term anoxic treatment of primary osteoblasts and mesenchymal precursors inhibited in vitro bone nodule formation and extracellular calcium deposition. Cell viability assays revealed that this effect was not caused by immediate or delayed cell death. Microarray profiling implicated down-regulation of the key osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 as a potential mechanism for the anoxic inhibition of differentiation. Subsequent analysis revealed not only a short-term differential regulation of Runx2 and its targets by anoxia and hypoxia, but a long-term inhibition of Runx2 transcriptional and protein levels after only 12-24 h of anoxic insult. Furthermore, we present evidence that Runx2 inhibition may, at least in part, be because of anoxic repression of BMP2, and that restoring Runx2 levels during anoxia by pretreatment with recombinant BMP2 rescued the anoxic inhibition of differentiation. Taken together, our findings indicate that brief exposure to anoxia (but not 2% hypoxia) down-regulated BMP2 and Runx2 expression, thus inhibiting critical steps in the osteogenic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal precursors and committed osteoblasts.","['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Collagen Type I', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Hypoxia', 'Mesoderm', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteocalcin', 'Oxygen', 'Skull', 'Stem Cells', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta']","['cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'GEN', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
6,15269347,"Innate and adaptive immunity depends critically on host recognition of pathogen-associated molecules. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key mediators of pathogen surveillance at the cell or phagocytic vacuole surface. However, mechanisms underlying recognition of pathogens in other cellular compartments remain unclear, and responses elicited by cytosolic challenge are poorly characterized. We therefore used mouse cDNA microarrays to investigate gene expression triggered by infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages with cytosol- and vacuole-localized Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a model cytosolic pathogen. The resulting gene expression program included two basic categories of induced genes: an ""early/persistent"" cluster consistent with NF-kappaB-dependent responses downstream of TLRs, and a subsequent ""late response"" cluster largely composed of IFN-responsive genes (IRGs). The early/persistent cluster was observed upon infection with WT, heat-killed, or mutant Lm lacking listeriolysin O, the pore-forming hemolysin that promotes escape from phagocytic vacuoles. However, the IRG cluster depended on entry of WT Lm into the cytosol. Infection with listeriolysin O-expressing, cytosolic Bacillus subtilis (Bs) strikingly recapitulated the expression profile associated with WT Lm, including IRG induction. IRG up-regulation was associated with MyD88-independent induction of IFN-beta transcription and activity. Whereas Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) lipoteichoic acid treatment confirmed that many late-response genes could also be stimulated through TLRs, our study identified a cytosol-specific transcriptional program independent of TLR signaling through MyD88. Further characterization of cytosolic surveillance pathway(s) and their points of convergence with TLR- and IFN-dependent pathways will enhance our understanding of the means by which mammals detect and respond to pathogens.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Bacillus subtilis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytosol', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Interferons', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Listeriosis', 'Macrophages', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', 'NF-kappa B', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Toll-Like Receptors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vacuoles']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Gene name (Bacillus subtilis)', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'ID list', 'Term ID list', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Mutation ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Locus ID', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Molecules']"
7,15314653,"The completion of the human genome sequence has made possible genome-wide studies of retroviral DNA integration. Here we report an analysis of 3,127 integration site sequences from human cells. We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors, analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines, strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV, though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration, but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites, as reported previously. ASLV vectors showed only a weak preference for active genes and no preference for transcription start regions. Thus, each of the three retroviruses studied showed unique integration site preferences, suggesting that virus-specific binding of integration complexes to chromatin features likely guides site selection.","['Avian Sarcoma Viruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genome, Human', 'HIV', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']","['Virus identifier', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Genome map', 'Human genetics', 'Genome report', 'HIVDB identifier', 'HIVDB entry format', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Virus annotation', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Read mapping', 'Oligonucleotide probe data', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Protein structure analysis', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Diffraction data integration', 'Ion counting', 'Integrated gene prediction']"
8,15609325,"V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2; synonyms HER2, NEU) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase-specific activity that acts as a major switch in different signal-transduction processes. ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma. Our aim was to detect ERBB2-regulated target genes that contribute to its tumorigenic effect on a genomewide scale. The differential gene expression profile of ERBB2-transfected and wild-type mouse fibroblasts was monitored employing DNA microarrays. Regulated expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR and validated by Western blot analysis. Genome wide gene expression profiling identified (i) known targets of ERBB2 signaling, (ii) genes implicated in tumorigenesis but so far not associated with ERBB2 signaling as well as (iii) genes not yet associated with oncogenic transformation, including novel genes without functional annotation. We also found that at least a fraction of coexpressed genes are closely linked on the genome. ERBB2 overexpression suppresses the transcription of antiangiogenic factors (e.g., Sparc, Timp3, Serpinf1) but induces expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Klf5, Tnfaip2, Sema3c). Profiling of ERBB2-dependent gene regulation revealed a compendium of potential diagnostic markers and putative therapeutic targets. Identification of coexpressed genes that colocalize in the genome may indicate gene regulatory mechanisms that require further study to evaluate functional coregulation.

9,15656970,"Post-endosymbiotic evolution of the proto-chloroplast was characterized by gene transfer to the nucleus. Hence, most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and the regulation of chloroplast functions includes nuclear transcriptional control. The expression profiles of 3292 nuclear Arabidopsis genes, most of them encoding chloroplast proteins, were determined from 101 different conditions and have been deposited at the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/) under . The 1590 most-regulated genes fell into 23 distinct groups of co-regulated genes (regulons). Genes of some regulons are not evenly distributed among the five Arabidopsis chromosomes and pairs of adjacent, co-expressed genes exist. Except regulons 1 and 2, regulons are heterogeneous and consist of genes coding for proteins with different subcellular locations or contributing to several biochemical functions. This implies that different organelles and/or metabolic pathways are co-ordinated at the nuclear transcriptional level, and a prototype for this is regulon 12 which contains genes with functions in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as genes associated with transport or transcription. The co-expression of nuclear genes coding for subunits of the photosystems or encoding proteins involved in the transcription/translation of plastome genes (particularly ribosome polypeptides) (regulons 1 and 2, respectively) implies the existence of a novel mechanism that co-ordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression and involves nuclear control of plastid ribosome abundance. The co-regulation of genes for photosystem and plastid ribosome proteins escapes a previously described general control of nuclear chloroplast proteins imposed by a transcriptional master switch, highlighting a mode of transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis which is different compared to other chloroplast functions. From the evolutionary standpoint, the results provided indicate that functional integration of the proto-chloroplast into the eukaryotic cell was associated with the establishment of different layers of nuclear transcriptional control.","['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chloroplasts', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Plant', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genome, Plant', 'Plastids', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosome report', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Genome map', 'Genome alignment', 'Genome report', 'Lipids', 'Nucleic acids', 'Ensembl ID', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
10,16081524,"Fibrates, such as ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and clofibrate, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists that have been in clinical use for many decades for treatment of dyslipidemia. When mice and rats are given PPARalpha agonists, these drugs cause hepatic peroxisome proliferation, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and eventually hepatocarcinogenesis. Importantly, primates are relatively refractory to these effects; however, the mechanisms for the species differences are not clearly understood. Cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to ciprofibrate at various dose levels for either 4 or 15 days, and the liver transcriptional profiles were examined using Affymetrix human GeneChips. Strong upregulation of many genes relating to fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was observed; this reflects the known pharmacology and activity of the fibrates. In addition, (1) many genes related to ribosome and proteasome biosynthesis were upregulated, (2) a large number of genes downregulated were in the complement and coagulation cascades, (3) a number of key regulatory genes, including members of the JUN, MYC, and NFkappaB families were downregulated, which appears to be in contrast to the rodent, where JUN and MYC are reported to upregulated after PPARalpha agonist treatment, (4) no transcriptional signal for DNA damage or oxidative stress was observed, and (5) transcriptional signals consistent with an anti-proliferative and a pro-apoptotic effect were seen.

This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription.

We then explored the contribution of the most prominent candidate genes revealed by our screening, namely prodynorphin, BDNF, and MHC class I molecules, to the facilitated LTP of VP16-CREB mice.

12,16208318,"Host defense against viruses probably depends on targeted death of infected host cells and then clearance of cellular corpses by macrophages. For this process to be effective, the macrophage must presumably avoid its own virus-induced death. Here we identify one such mechanism. We show that mice lacking the chemokine Ccl5 are immune compromised to the point of delayed viral clearance, excessive airway inflammation and respiratory death after mouse parainfluenza or human influenza virus infection. Virus-inducible levels of Ccl5 are required to prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl5 requires activation of the Ccr5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai)-PI3K-AKT and G(alphai)-MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The antiapoptotic action of chemokine signaling may therefore allow scavengers to finally stop the host cell-to-cell infectious process.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL5', 'Chemokines, CC', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages, Alveolar', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Receptors, CCR5', 'Respirovirus Infections', 'Sendai virus', 'Signal Transduction', 'Virus Replication']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'HPA antibody id', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Epitope mapping', 'Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular docking', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Light microscopy', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Infectious disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Virus annotation', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'DNA replication and recombination']"
13,16236136,"Keloids are a dermal fibrotic disease whose etiology remains totally unknown and for which there is no successful treatment. Here, we employed cDNA microarray analysis to examine gene expression in keloid lesions and control skin. We found that 32 genes among the 9000 tested were strongly up-regulated in keloid lesions, of which 21 were confirmed by Northern blotting. These included at least seven chondrocyte/osteoblast marker genes, and RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcription factors specific for these genes, SOX9 and CBFA1, were induced.

Intriguingly, scleraxis, a transcription factor known as a marker of tendons and ligaments, was also induced in keloid fibroblasts.

14,16251485,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin occurring naturally in a wide range of food commodities. In animals, it has been shown to cause a variety of adverse effects, nephrocarcinogenicity being the most prominent. Because of its high toxic potency and the continuous exposure of the human population, OTA has raised public health concerns. There is significant debate on how to use the rat carcinogenicity data to assess the potential risk to humans. In this context, the question of the mechanism of action of OTA appears of key importance and was studied through the application of a toxicogenomics approach. Male Fischer rats were fed OTA for up to 2 years. Renal tumors were discovered during the last 6 months of the study. The total tumor incidence reached 25% at the end of the study. Gene expression profile was analyzed in groups of animals taken in intervals from 7 days to 12 months. Tissue-specific responses were observed in kidney versus liver. For selected genes, microarray data were confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. In kidney, several genes known as markers of kidney injury and cell regeneration were significantly modulated by OTA. The expression of genes known to be involved in DNA synthesis and repair, or genes induced as a result of DNA damage, was only marginally modulated. Very little or no effect was found amongst genes associated with apoptosis. Alterations of gene expression indicating effects on calcium homeostasis and a disruption of pathways regulated by the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were observed in the kidney but not in the liver. Previous data have suggested that a reduction in HNF4alpha may be associated with nephrocarcinogenicity. Many Nrf2-regulated genes are involved in chemical detoxication and antioxidant defense. The depletion of these genes is likely to impair the defense potential of the cells, resulting in chronic elevation of oxidative stress in the kidney. The inhibition of defense mechanism appears as a highly plausible new mechanism, which could contribute to OTA carcinogenicity.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Carcinogens', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mycotoxins', 'Ochratoxins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Toxicogenetics']","['Ancestral reconstruction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Pathogens', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'MAT', 'Toxins and targets', 'Toxin name', 'Toxin structure', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Genetics', 'Phylogenetics', 'Toxicology']"
15,16332871,"A transcriptional analysis of the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 to controlled air-drying (desiccation) and subsequent rehydration under minimal glucose conditions was performed. Expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle was observed to increase during drying and remained in this state during the rehydration phase. When the BY4743 expression profile for the dried sample was compared to that of a commercially prepared dry active yeast, strikingly similar expression changes were observed. The fact that these two samples, dried by different means, possessed very similar transcriptional profiles supports the hypothesis that the response to desiccation is a coordinated event independent of the particular conditions involved in water removal. Similarities between ""stationary-phase-essential genes"" and those upregulated during desiccation were also noted, suggesting commonalities in different routes to reduced metabolic states. Trends in extracellular and intracellular glucose and trehalose levels suggested that the cells were in a ""holding pattern"" during the rehydration phase, a concept that was reinforced by cell cycle analyses. Application of a ""redescription mining"" algorithm suggested that sulfur metabolism is important for cell survival during desiccation and rehydration.","['Cell Survival', 'Desiccation', 'Fatty Acids', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Glucose', 'Glyoxylates', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Trehalose']","['Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Design', 'Deletion detection', 'Amplification detection', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Fate map', 'Fungi', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Kinetic model', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
16,16362075,"Central to the pathology of malaria disease are the repeated cycles of parasite invasion and destruction of human erythrocytes. In Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent species causing malaria, erythrocyte invasion involves several specific receptor-ligand interactions that direct the pathway used to invade the host cell, with parasites varying in their dependency on these different pathways. Gene disruption of a key invasion ligand in the 3D7 parasite strain, the P. falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homolog 2b (PfRh2b), resulted in the parasite invading via a novel pathway. Here, we show results that suggest the molecular basis for this novel pathway is not due to a molecular switch but is instead mediated by the redeployment of machinery already present in the parent parasite but masked by the dominant role of PfRh2b. This would suggest that interactions directing invasion are organized hierarchically, where silencing of dominant invasion ligands reveal underlying alternative pathways. This provides wild parasites with the ability to adapt to immune-mediated selection or polymorphism in erythrocyte receptors and has implications for the use of invasion-related molecules in candidate vaccines.","['Animals', 'Erythrocytes', 'Genes, Protozoan', 'Humans', 'Malaria, Falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Plasmid map', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

They are expressed in the early metanephric mesenchyme and are required for the induction of ureteric bud formation and its subsequent branching morphogenesis. They are also required for the normal nephrogenesis response of the metanephric mesenchyme to inductive signals from the ureteric bud. In this report, we use microarrays to perform a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the Hoxa11/Hoxd11 mutant kidney phenotype. We examined E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E16.5 developmental time points. A novel high throughput strategy for validation of microarray data is described, using additional biological replicates and an independent microarray platform. The results identified 13 genes with greater than 3-fold change in expression in early mutant kidneys, including Hoxa11s, GATA6, TGFbeta2, chemokine ligand 12, angiotensin receptor like 1, cytochrome P450, cadherin5, and Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Iroquois 3, EST A930038C07Rik, Meox2, Prkcn, and Slc40a1.

19,17028315,"The male-specific lethal (MSL) ribonucleoprotein complex is necessary for equalization of X:A expression levels in Drosophila males, which have a single X chromosome. It binds selectively to the male X chromosome and directs acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4Ac16), a modification linked to elevated transcription. roX1 and roX2 noncoding RNAs are essential but redundant components of this complex. Simultaneous removal of both roX RNAs reduces X localization of the MSL proteins and permits their ectopic binding to autosomal sites and the chromocenter. However, the MSL proteins still colocalize, and low levels of H4Ac16 are detected at ectopic sites of MSL binding and residual sites on the X chromosome of roX1- roX2- males. Microarray analysis was performed to reveal the effect of roX1 and roX2 elimination on X-linked and autosomal gene expression. Expression of the X chromosome is decreased by 26% in roX1- roX2- male larvae. Enhanced expression could not be detected at autosomal sites of MSL binding in roX1- roX2- males.

The inherent VFA dependence of ruminant cells was exploited to add a level of increased sensitivity to the study of the role of butyrate gene-response elements in regulatory biochemical pathways. Global gene expression profiles of the bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The detailed mechanisms by which butyrate induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The functional category and pathway analyses of the microarray data revealed that four canonical pathways (Cell cycles: G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and pyrimidine metabolism; G1/S checkpoint regulation and purine metabolism) were significantly perturbed. The biologically relevant networks and pathways of these genes were also identified. IGF2, TGFB1, TP53, E2F4, and CDC2 were established as being centered in these genomic networks.

21,17220229,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium must successfully transition the broad fluctuations in oxygen concentrations encountered in the host. In Escherichia coli, FNR is one of the main regulatory proteins involved in O2 sensing. To assess the role of FNR in serovar Typhimurium, we constructed an isogenic fnr mutant in the virulent wild-type strain (ATCC 14028s) and compared their transcriptional profiles and pathogenicities in mice. Here, we report that, under anaerobic conditions, 311 genes (6.80% of the genome) are regulated directly or indirectly by FNR; of these, 87 genes (28%) are poorly characterized. Regulation by FNR in serovar Typhimurium is similar to, but distinct from, that in E. coli. Thus, genes/operons involved in aerobic metabolism, NO. detoxification, flagellar biosynthesis, motility, chemotaxis, and anaerobic carbon utilization are regulated by FNR in a fashion similar to that in E. coli. However, genes/operons existing in E. coli but regulated by FNR only in serovar Typhimurium include those coding for ethanolamine utilization, a universal stress protein, a ferritin-like protein, and a phosphotransacetylase. Interestingly, Salmonella-specific genes/operons regulated by FNR include numerous virulence genes within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1), newly identified flagellar genes (mcpAC, cheV), and the virulence operon (srfABC). Furthermore, the role of FNR as a positive regulator of motility, flagellar biosynthesis, and pathogenesis was confirmed by showing that the mutant is nonmotile, lacks flagella, is attenuated in mice, and does not survive inside macrophages. The inability of the mutant to survive inside macrophages is likely due to its sensitivity to the reactive oxygen species generated by NADPH phagocyte oxidase.","['Anaerobiosis', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Salmonella Infections', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Transcription Factors', 'Virulence']","['Analysis', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein domains', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
22,17550994,"Circadian rhythms are approximate 24-h behavioral and physiological cycles that function to prepare an organism for daily environmental changes. The basic clock mechanism is a network of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that drive rhythmic expression of genes over a 24-h period. The objectives of this study were to identify transcripts with a circadian pattern of expression in adult skeletal muscle and to determine the effect of the Clock mutation on gene expression. Expression profiling on muscle samples collected every 4 h for 48 h was performed. Using COSOPT, we identified a total of 215 transcripts as having a circadian pattern of expression. Real-time PCR results verified the circadian expression of the core clock genes, Bmal1, Per2, and Cry2. Annotation revealed cycling genes were involved in a range of biological processes including transcription, lipid metabolism, protein degradation, ion transport, and vesicular trafficking. The tissue specificity of the skeletal muscle circadian transcriptome was highlighted by the presence of known muscle-specific genes such as Myod1, Ucp3, Atrogin1 (Fbxo32), and Myh1 (myosin heavy chain IIX). Expression profiling was also performed on muscle from the Clock mutant mouse and sarcomeric genes such as actin and titin, and many mitochondrial genes were significantly downregulated in the muscle of Clock mutant mice.

At the transcript level, the expression of 689 genes, representing approximately 40% of the chromosome, differed by twofold or more between the two growth phases.

At the protein level, an average of 527 and 403 protein spots were detected in the exponential and stationary phases of growth, respectively. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify 172 protein spots, 128 of which were growth phase regulated.

24,18192383,"Gram-negative bacteria possess stress responses to maintain the integrity of the cell envelope. Stress sensors monitor outer membrane permeability, envelope protein folding, and energization of the inner membrane. The systems used by gram-negative bacteria to sense and combat stress resulting from disruption of the peptidoglycan layer are not well characterized. The peptidoglycan layer is a single molecule that completely surrounds the cell and ensures its structural integrity. During cell growth, new peptidoglycan subunits are incorporated into the peptidoglycan layer by a series of enzymes called the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). To explore how gram-negative bacteria respond to peptidoglycan stress, global gene expression analysis was used to identify Escherichia coli stress responses activated following inhibition of specific PBPs by the beta-lactam antibiotics amdinocillin (mecillinam) and cefsulodin. Inhibition of PBPs with different roles in peptidoglycan synthesis has different consequences for cell morphology and viability, suggesting that not all perturbations to the peptidoglycan layer generate equivalent stresses. We demonstrate that inhibition of different PBPs resulted in both shared and unique stress responses. The regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay was activated by inhibition of all PBPs tested. Furthermore, we show that activation of the Rcs phosphorelay increased survival in the presence of these antibiotics, independently of capsule synthesis. Both activation of the phosphorelay and survival required signal transduction via the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF and the response regulator RcsB. We propose that the Rcs pathway responds to peptidoglycan damage and contributes to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to beta-lactam antibiotics.","['Amdinocillin', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Capsules', 'Cefsulodin', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Penicillin-Binding Proteins', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, sigma']","['Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Molecules', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'Microbial ecology', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Peptide ID', 'KEGG Glycan ID', 'Peptide property', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"
25,18223090,"Campylobacter jejuni, a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium, is a leading bacterial cause of human food-borne illness. Acute disease is associated with C. jejuni invasion of the intestinal epithelium. Further, maximal host cell invasion requires the secretion of proteins termed Campylobacter invasion antigens (Cia). As bile acids are known to alter the pathogenic behavior of other gastrointestinal pathogens, we hypothesized that the virulence potential of Campylobacter may be triggered by the bile acid deoxycholate (DOC). In support of this hypothesis, culturing C. jejuni with a physiologically relevant concentration of DOC significantly altered the kinetics of cell invasion, as shown by gentamicin protection assays. In contrast to C. jejuni harvested from Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates, C. jejuni harvested from MH agar plates supplemented with DOC secreted the Cia proteins, as judged by metabolic labeling experiments. DOC was also found to induce the expression of the ciaB gene, as determined by beta-galactosidase reporter, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and microarray analyses. Microarray analysis further revealed that DOC induced the expression of virulence genes (ciaB, cmeABC, dccR, and tlyA).

HIV-1 p17 matrix protein (p17) modulates a variety of cellular responses, and its biological activity depends on the expression of p17 receptors (p17Rs) on the surface of target cells. In this study, we show that peripheral blood pDCs express p17Rs on their surface and that freshly isolated pDCs are sensitive to p17 stimulation. Upon p17 treatment, pDCs undergo phenotypic differentiation with up-regulation of CCR7. A chemotaxis assay reveals that p17-treated pDCs migrate in response to CCL19, suggesting that these cells may acquire the ability to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs. In contrast, p17 does not induce release of type I IFN nor does it enhance pDC expression of CD80, CD86, CD83, or MHC class II. Microarray gene expression analysis indicated that p17-stimulated pDCs down-regulate the expression of molecules whose functions are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, protection from apoptosis, and cell proliferation induction.

28,18437205,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain whose deficiency has been implicated in a wide variety of human mitochondrial disease manifestations. Its multi-step biosynthesis involves production of polyisoprenoid diphosphate in a reaction that requires the enzymes be encoded by PDSS1 and PDSS2. Homozygous mutations in either of these genes, in humans, lead to severe neuromuscular disease, with nephrotic syndrome seen in PDSS2 deficiency. We now show that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with the missense Pdss2(kd/kd) genotype can be attributed to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect. Levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates from B6.Pdss2(kd/kd) mutants were significantly lower than those in B6 control mice. Disease manifestations originate specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease is seen in Podocin/cre,Pdss2(loxP/loxP) knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6.Alb/cre,Pdss2(loxP/loxP) knockout mice have no overt disease despite demonstration that their livers have undetectable CoQ9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and significantly altered intermediary metabolism as evidenced by transcriptional profiling and amino acid quantitation. These data suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment.","['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Electron Transport', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mitochondria, Liver', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Ubiquinone']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'Electron density map', 'Electron microscopy', 'Transposon prediction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Mitochondria', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Sequin format']"
29,18467551,"Leptin modulates energy metabolism and lung development. We hypothesize that the effects of leptin on postnatal lung development are volume dependent from 2 to 10 wk of age and are independent of hypometabolism associated with leptin deficiency. To test the hypotheses, effects of leptin deficiency on lung maturation were characterized in age groups of C57BL/6J mice with varying Lep(ob) genotypes. Quasi-static pressure-volume curves and respiratory impedance measurements were performed to profile differences in respiratory system mechanics. Morphometric analysis was conducted to estimate alveolar size and number. Oxygen consumption was measured to assess metabolic rate. Lung volume at 40-cmH(2)O airway pressure (V(40)) increased with age in each genotypic group, and V(40) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice beginning at 2 wk. Differences were amplified through 7 wk of age relative to wild-type (+/+) mice. Morphometric analysis showed that alveolar surface area was lower in ob/ob compared with +/+ and heterozygote (ob/+) mice beginning at 2 wk. Unlike the other genotypic groups, alveolar size did not increase with age in ob/ob mice. In another experiment, ob/ob at 4 wk received leptin replacement (5 microg.g(-1) x day(-1)) for 8 days, and expression levels of the Col1a1, Col3a1, Col6a3, Mmp2, Tieg1, and Stat1 genes were significantly increased concomitantly with elevated V(40). Leptin-induced increases in V(40) corresponded with enlarged alveolar size and surface area. Gene expression suggested a remodeling event of lung parenchyma after exogenous leptin replacement. These data support the hypothesis that leptin is critical to postnatal lung remodeling, particularly related to increased V(40) and enlarged alveolar surface area.","['Aging', 'Air Pressure', 'Airway Resistance', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Leptin', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pulmonary Alveoli', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Respiratory Mechanics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['Imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Medical imaging', 'pair', 'Structure alignment (pair)', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Peptide molecular weight hits', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Generation', 'Gene tree construction', 'Respiratory medicine', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

Loss of function as well as increased dosage of the MECP2 gene cause a host of neuropsychiatric disorders. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlying these disorders, we examined gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus of mice that either lack or overexpress MeCP2. In both models, MeCP2 dysfunction induced changes in the expression levels of thousands of genes, but unexpectedly the majority of genes (approximately 85%) appeared to be activated by MeCP2. We selected six genes and confirmed that MeCP2 binds to their promoters. Furthermore, we showed that MeCP2 associates with the transcriptional activator CREB1 at the promoter of an activated target but not a repressed target. These studies suggest that MeCP2 regulates the expression of a wide range of genes in the hypothalamus and that it can function as both an activator and a repressor of transcription.","['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hypothalamic Diseases', 'Hypothalamus', 'Male', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Rare diseases', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'System metadata', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'DNA transcription']"

We have now made use of gene expression profiling, and in particular of the previously described signatures of cell signaling pathway activation, to explore the events associated with mammary gland development. We find that there is elevated E2F-specific pathway activity prior to lactation and relatively low levels of other important signaling pathways, such as RAS, MYC and SRC. Upon lactation and continuing into the involution phase, these patterns reverse with a dramatic increase in RAS, SRC and MYC pathway activity and a decline in E2F activity. At the end of involution, these patterns return to that of the adult non-lactating mammary gland. The importance of the changes in E2F pathway activity, particularly during the proliferative phase of mammary development, was confirmed through the analysis of mice deficient for various E2F proteins.

In this study, we used a non-viral vector-based method to express LMP1 in primary human GC B cells. Gene expression profiling revealed that LMP1 induced in GC B cells transcriptional changes characteristic of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines. Strikingly, LMP1 down-regulated the expression of B-cell-specific genes including B-cell receptor components such as CD79A, CD79B, CD19, CD20, CD22, and BLNK. LMP1 also induced the expression of ID2, a negative regulator of B-cell differentiation.

In this study, we investigated whether coculture with monolayers of cells derived from mouse AGM and fetal liver, or with stromal cell lines derived from these tissues, can enhance hESC hematopoietic differentiation. We found that under such conditions hESC-derived differentiating cells formed early hematopoietic progenitors, with a peak at day 18-21 of differentiation that corresponded to the highest CD34 expression. These hESC-derived hematopoietic cells were capable of primary and secondary hematopoietic engraftment into immunocompromised mice at substantially higher levels than described previously. Transcriptional and functional analysis identified TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3 as positive enhancers of hESC hematopoietic differentiation that can further stimulate this process when added to the culture.

Here we show that Tfh cells had a distinct gene expression profile and developed in vivo independently of the Th1 or Th2 cell lineages. Tfh cell generation was regulated by ICOS ligand (ICOSL) expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). However, unlike Th17 cells, differentiation of Tfh cells did not require transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or Th17-specific orphan nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma in vivo. Finally, naive T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but not TGF-beta signaling preferentially acquired Tfh gene expression and promoted germinal-center reactions in vivo.

37,18661521,"Distant metastasis is a major factor associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), but little is known of its molecular mechanisms. New markers that predict clinical outcome, in particular the ability of primary tumors to develop metastatic tumors, are urgently needed. Based on a genome-wide gene expression analysis using clinical specimens of HNSCC, we narrowed our focus to the analysis of the neurotensin (NTS) and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) oncogenic signal pathways. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank tests revealed that high mRNA expression levels of NTS and NTSR1 had a significant adverse effect on metastasis-free survival rate, suggesting a contribution of this pathway in HNSCC cancer progression. In HNSCC cells, which expressed NTSR1, a NTS agonist promoted cellular invasion, migration and induction of several mRNAs, such as interleukin 8 and matrix metalloproteinase 1 transcripts. In addition, knock down of NTSR1 expression with small interfering RNAs resulted in reduction of cellular invasion and migration in HNSCC cell lines. Our findings suggest a critical role for the NTS and NTSR1 oncogenic pathways in invasion and migration of HNSCC cells during the metastatic process. Our study raises the possibility that NTS and NTSR1 could be a useful predictive marker of poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC and a molecular therapeutic target in antimetastatic strategies for HNSCCs.","['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 12', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neurotensin', 'Osteopontin', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Neurotensin', 'Signal Transduction']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Matrix', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Matrix format', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
38,18680105,"Over-expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 is regarded as an early marker for several cancers. This protein is associated with proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and has itself been described as a proto-oncogene. Our earlier experiments drew a connection between hnRNP A2/B1 levels and cell proliferation and raised the possibility that this protein contributes to the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer. Limited knowledge of the downstream targets of hnRNP A2/B1 has, however, precluded a clear understanding of their roles in cancer cell growth. To define the pathways in which this protein acts we have now carried out microarray experiments with total RNA from Colo16 epithelial cells transfected with an shRNA that markedly suppresses hnRNP A2/B1 expression. The microarray data identified 123 genes, among 22 283 human gene probe sets, with altered expression levels in hnRNP A2/B1-depleted cells. Ontological analysis showed that many of these downstream targets are involved in regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation and that this group of proteins is significantly over-represented amongst the affected proteins. The changes detected in the microarray experiments were confirmed by real-time PCR for a subset of proliferation-related genes. Immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR demonstrated that hnRNP A2/B1 formed complexes with the transcripts of many of the verified downstream genes, suggesting that hnRNP A2/B1 contributes to the regulation of these genes.

39,18691609,"Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR(1)) by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) elicits severe immunosuppression accompanied by thymic atrophy. Previous evidence suggests that TCDD targets both thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells. The AhR induces cell-specific changes in gene transcription via binding to the dioxin response element DRE; however, the underlying specificity-mechanisms, in particular with regard to the role of promoter element context, and possible transcription factor crosstalk remain poorly understood. Global gene expression in the cortical thymic epithelial cell line ET at 2, 4, and 6 h following 5 nM TCDD exposure resulted in differential regulation of 201 genes. JASPAR and TRANSFAC mapped the statistically over-represented promoter elements in the regulated genes to specific transcription factor binding sites, suggesting a regulatory role in AhR signaling. Over-represented elements included the xenobiotic response element XRE, NF kappaB-Rel, HRE, PPAR gamma, GR, PAX-4 and estrogen receptor binding sites. Co-treatment experiments with TCDD and CoCl(2), to induce hypoxia, or TCDD and 17-beta-estradiol (E2) indicated crosstalk between AhR and Hif or ER, in agreement with other experimental models. The computational identification of TFBS and the demonstration of interaction confirm their interactions with AhR signaling and suggest that the other over-represented elements may also be important in the immunosuppressive effects elicited by TCDD. In conclusion, we demonstrated the importance of promoter element cooperation in the shaping of a cell-specific AhR response.

40,18725516,"Cellular diversity of the brain is largely attributed to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of progenitor cells. In mammalian cerebral development, it has been difficult to determine how heterogeneous the neural progenitor cells are, owing to dynamic changes in their nuclear position and gene expression. To address this issue, we systematically analyzed the cDNA profiles of a large number of single progenitor cells at the mid-embryonic stage in mouse. By cluster analysis and in situ hybridization, we have identified a set of genes that distinguishes between the apical and basal progenitors. Despite their relatively homogeneous global gene expression profiles, the apical progenitors exhibit highly variable expression patterns of Notch signaling components, raising the possibility that this causes the heterogeneous division patterns of these cells. Furthermore, we successfully captured the nascent state of basal progenitor cells. These cells are generated shortly after birth from the division of the apical progenitors, and show strong expression of the major Notch ligand delta-like 1, which soon fades away as the cells migrate in the ventricular zone. We also demonstrated that attenuation of Notch signals immediately induces differentiation of apical progenitors into nascent basal progenitors.

We find that cocaine regulates myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors to control these two processes in vivo. Cocaine suppresses striatal MEF2 activity in part through a mechanism involving cAMP, the regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and calcineurin. We show that reducing MEF2 activity in the NAc in vivo is required for the cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density. Surprisingly, we find that increasing MEF2 activity in the NAc, which blocks the cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine density, enhances sensitized behavioral responses to cocaine. Together, our findings implicate MEF2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing MEF2 activity (and increasing spine density) in NAc may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long-lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cocaine', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors', 'Neostriatum', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Synapses']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Kinase name', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Drug report', 'Drug structure', 'Drug accession', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Regulatory affairs', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Sequence accession (nucleic acid)', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats']"

Here we characterize 4T1-derived cell lines for EMT, in vitro invasiveness and in vivo metastatic ability. Contrary to expectations, 67NR cells, which form primary tumors but fail to metastasize, express vimentin and N-cadherin, but not E-cadherin. 4T1 cells express E-cadherin and ZO-1, but are migratory, invasive, and metastasize to multiple sites. 66cl4 cells form lung metastases and display a mixed phenotype, but are not as migratory or invasive as 67NR cells.

44,18799003,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element. However, Zn bioavailability from commonly consumed plants may be reduced due to phytic acid. Zn supplementation has been used to treat diarrheal disease in children, and in the U.S. swine industry at pharmacological levels to promote growth and fecal consistency, but underlying mechanisms explaining these beneficial effects remain unknown. Moreover, adding supplemental phytase improves Zn bioavailability. Thus, we hypothesized that benefits of pharmacological Zn supplementation result from changes in gene expression that could be further affected by supplemental phytase. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding newly weaned pigs dietary Zn (150, 1,000, or 2,000 mg Zn/kg) as Zn oxide with or without phytase [500 phytase units (FTU)/kg] for 14 d on hepatic gene expression.

Several recent studies have identified signalling networks within neurons that control excitatory synapse development. However, less is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity-dependent development of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing inhibitory synapses. Here we report the identification of a transcription factor, Npas4, that plays a role in the development of inhibitory synapses by regulating the expression of activity-dependent genes, which in turn control the number of GABA-releasing synapses that form on excitatory neurons. These findings demonstrate that the activity-dependent gene program regulates inhibitory synapse development, and suggest a new role for this program in controlling the homeostatic balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophysiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hippocampus', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Rats', 'Synapses', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Isotropic B factor', 'Protein structure report', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Physiology', 'Physiology parameter', 'Biology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Selection detection', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence']"

Here, we profiled miRNA expression in HTLV-1-transformed human T-cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adult T-cell leukemia patients. Analyses of 11 different profiles revealed six miRNAs that were consistently up-regulated. Two of the up-regulated miRNAs (miR-93 and miR-130b) target the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the mRNA for a tumor suppressor protein, tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1). A low expression level of TP53INP1 protein was found in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Additionally, when antagomirs were used to knock down miR-93 and miR-130b in these cells, the expression of TP53INP1 was increased, suggesting that the latter is regulated inside cells by the former. A role for TP53INP1 in regulating cell growth was established by experiments that showed that enhanced TP53INP1 expression increased apoptosis.

The strategies evolved by gut microbes to sense and process diverse glycans have important implications for the assembly and operation of this ecosystem. The human gut-derived bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron forages on both host and dietary glycans. Its ability to target these substrates resides in 88 polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), encompassing 18% of its genome. Whole genome transcriptional profiling and genetic tests were used to define the mechanisms underlying host glycan foraging in vivo and in vitro. PULs that target all major classes of host glycans were identified. However, mucin O-glycans are the principal host substrate foraged in vivo. Simultaneous deletion of five genes encoding ECF-sigma transcription factors, which activate mucin O-glycan utilization, produces defects in bacterial persistence in the gut and in mother-to-offspring transmission. Thus, PUL-mediated glycan catabolism is an important component in gut colonization and may impact microbiota ecology.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacteroides', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Polysaccharides', 'Swine', 'Symbiosis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Gastroenterology', 'Abstract', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'swiss feature', 'UniProtKB format', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"

However, there is a paucity of information on barrier function in human mammary epithelium. Here, we have established characteristics of a polarizing differentiating model of human mammary epithelial cells capable of forming a high-resistance/low-conductance barrier in a predictable manner, viz., by using MCF10A cells on permeable membranes. Inulin flux decreased and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) increased over the course of several days after seeding MCF10A cells on permeable membranes. MCF10A cells exhibited multipotent phenotypic differentiation into layers expressing basal and lumenal markers when placed on permeable membranes, with at least two distinct cell phenotypes. A clonal subline of MCF10A, generated by culturing stem-like cells under non-adherent conditions, also generated a barrier-forming epithelial membrane with cells expressing markers of both basal and lumenal differentiation (CD10 and MUC1, respectively). Progressive changes associated with differentiation, including wholesale inhibition of cell-cycle genes and stimulation of cell and tissue morphogenic genes, were observed by gene expression profiling.

51,19056695,"Insulators are DNA elements that prevent inappropriate interactions between the neighboring regions of the genome. They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.","['Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genome, Human', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Insulator Elements', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins']","['Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Genome map', 'Human genetics', 'Genome report', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Proteins', 'Protein expression', 'protein']"
52,19060153,"The roles of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacteria have been debated. Here, the role of five TA systems in regard to biofilm development was investigated (listed as toxin/antitoxin: MazF/MazE, RelE/RelB, ChpB, YoeB/YefM, and YafQ/DinJ). Although these multiple TA systems were reported previously to not impact bacterial fitness, we found that deletion of the five TA systems decreased biofilm formation initially (8 h) on three different surfaces and then increased biofilm formation (24 h) by decreasing biofilm dispersal. Whole-transcriptome profiling revealed that the deletion of the five TA systems induced expression of a single gene, yjgK, which encodes an uncharacterized protein; quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed consistent induction of this gene (at 8, 15, and 24 h). Corroborating the complex phenotype seen upon deleting the TA systems, overexpression of YjgK decreased biofilm formation at 8 h and increased biofilm formation at 24 h; deletion of yjgK also affected biofilm formation in the expected manner by increasing biofilm formation after 8 h and decreasing biofilm formation after 24 h. In addition, YjgK significantly reduced biofilm dispersal. Whole-transcriptome profiling revealed YjgK represses fimbria genes at 8 h (corroborated by qRT-PCR and a yeast agglutination assay), which agrees with the decrease in biofilm formation upon deleting the five TA systems at 8 h, as well as that seen upon overexpressing YjgK. Sand column assays confirmed that deleting the five TA systems reduced cell attachment. Furthermore, deletion of each of the five toxins increased biofilm formation at 8 h, and overexpression of the five toxins repressed biofilm formation at 8 h, a result that is opposite that of deleting all five TA systems; this suggests that complex regulation occurs involving the antitoxins. Also, the ability of the global regulator Hha to reduce biofilm formation was dependent on the presence of these TA systems. Hence, we suggest that one role of TA systems is to influence biofilm formation.","['Biofilms', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Fimbriae Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Plasmids', 'Polysaccharides', 'Signal Transduction']","['BioJSON (BioXSD)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Plasmid map drawing', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

54,19114476,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is major cause of invasive disease in newborn infants and the leading cause of neonatal meningitis. To gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), GBS must not only subvert host defenses in the bloodstream but also invade and survive within brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), the principal cell layer composing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). While several GBS determinants that contribute to the invasion of BMEC have been identified, little is known about the GBS factors that are required for intracellular survival and ultimate disease progression. In this study we sought to identify these factors by screening a random GBS mutant library in an in vitro survival assay. One mutant was identified which contained a disruption in a two-component regulatory system homologous to CiaR/CiaH, which is present in other streptococcal pathogens. Deletion of the putative response regulator, ciaR, in GBS resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular survival within neutrophils, murine macrophages, and human BMEC, which was linked to increased susceptibility to killing by antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, competition experiments with mice showed that wild-type GBS had a significant survival advantage over the GBS DeltaciaR mutant in the bloodstream and brain. Microarray analysis comparing gene expression between wild-type and DeltaciaR mutant GBS bacteria revealed several CiaR-regulated genes that may contribute to stress tolerance and the subversion of host defenses by GBS. Our results identify the GBS CiaR response regulator as a crucial factor in GBS intracellular survival and invasive disease pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils', 'Protein Kinases', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcus agalactiae', 'Virulence']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Protein databases', 'Kinase name', 'Sequence alignment', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Infectious disease', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"

Here, we report that Drosha and DGCR8 regulate each other posttranscriptionally. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex cleaves the hairpin structures embedded in the DGCR8 mRNA and thereby destabilizes the mRNA. We further find that DGCR8 stabilizes the Drosha protein via protein-protein interaction. This crossregulation between Drosha and DGCR8 may contribute to the homeostatic control of miRNA biogenesis.

DS-AMKL blasts harbor a mutation in GATA1, which leads to loss of full-length protein but expression of the GATA-1s isoform. To assess the consequences of ETS protein misexpression on megakaryopoiesis, we expressed ETS2, ERG, and the related protein FLI-1 in wild-type and Gata1 mutant murine fetal liver progenitors. These studies revealed that ETS2, ERG, and FLI-1 facilitated the expansion of megakaryocytes from wild-type, Gata1-knockdown, and Gata1s knockin progenitors, but none of the genes could overcome the differentiation block characteristic of the Gata1-knockdown megakaryocytes. Although overexpression of ETS proteins increased the proportion of CD41(+) cells generated from Gata1s-knockin progenitors, their expression led to a significant reduction in the more mature CD42 fraction. Serial replating assays revealed that overexpression of ERG or FLI-1 immortalized Gata1-knockdown and Gata1s knockin, but not wild-type, fetal liver progenitors.

Increasing or decreasing the expression of ANAC102 did not affect adult plant survival of low-oxygen stress. Decreased ANAC102 expression significantly decreased germination efficiency following a 0.1% oxygen treatment, but increased expression had no effect on germination. This protective role during germination appeared to be specific to low-oxygen stress, implicating ANAC102 as an important regulator of seed germination under flooding.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, Plant', 'Germination', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Oxygen', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Root Cap', 'Plant Shoots', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Seeds', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tissue Survival', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Plant biology', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Structure determination', 'Recombination detection', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'GEN', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Protein structure', 'Mathematical model', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Regulatory RNA']"
61,19180177,"Complex phenotypes such as the transformation of a normal population of cells into cancerous tissue result from a series of molecular triggers gone awry. We describe a method that searches for a genetic network consistent with expression changes observed under the knock-down of a set of genes that share a common role in the cell, such as a disease phenotype. The method extends the Nested Effects Model of Markowetz et al. (2005) by using a probabilistic factor graph to search for a network representing interactions among these silenced genes. The method also expands the network by attaching new genes at specific downstream points, providing candidates for subsequent perturbations to further characterize the pathway. We investigated an extension provided by the factor graph approach in which the model distinguishes between inhibitory and stimulatory interactions. We found that the extension yielded significant improvements in recovering the structure of simulated and Saccharomyces cerevisae networks. We applied the approach to discover a signaling network among genes involved in a human colon cancer cell invasiveness pathway. The method predicts several genes with new roles in the invasiveness process. We knocked down two genes identified by our approach and found that both knock-downs produce loss of invasive potential in a colon cancer cell line. Nested effects models may be a powerful tool for inferring regulatory connections and genes that operate in normal and disease-related processes.","['Algorithms', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Gene Silencing', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Normal Distribution', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Transduction']","['Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Simulation', 'Computer science', 'Simulation analysis', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Statistical modelling', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'RNA-Seq', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic engineering', 'Dirichlet distribution format', 'Dirichlet distribution', 'Isotopic distributions calculation', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
62,19190340,"The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) encodes a transcription factor involved in cell growth and development. As we previously reported, WT1 expression is hardly detectable in normal hepatic tissue but is induced in liver cirrhosis. Although WT1 has been found to be overexpressed in a number of malignancies, the role of WT1 in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been clarified. We found that WT1 is expressed in several human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, including PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2, and in HCC tumor tissue in 42% of patients. WT1 small interfering RNAs did not affect proliferation rate of HCC cells but abrogated their resistance to anoikis. Transcriptome analysis of PLC/PRF/5 cells after WT1 knockdown showed up-regulation of 251 genes and down-regulation of 321. Ninety percent of the former corresponded to metabolic genes, mostly those characterizing the mature hepatocyte phenotype. On the contrary, genes that decreased upon WT1 inhibition were mainly related to defense against apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumor progression. In agreement with these findings, WT1 expression increased the resistance of liver tumor cells to doxorubicin, a compound used to treat HCC. Interestingly, doxorubicin strongly enhanced WT1 expression in both HCC cells and normal human hepatocytes. Among different chemotherapeutics, induction of WT1 transcription was restricted to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors. When WT1 expression was prohibited, doxorubicin caused a marked increase in caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, WT1 is expressed in a substantial proportion of HCC contributing to tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting that WT1 may be an important target for HCC treatment.","['Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Here we show that genes activated in cultured mouse fibroblasts in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor could be categorized into roughly three groups, each with different induction kinetics. Although differences in transcription were important in determining the grouping of these genes, differences in mRNA stability also exerted a strong influence on the temporal order of gene expression, in some cases overriding that of transcriptional control elements. Transcripts of mRNA expressed early had abundant AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions, whereas those expressed later had fewer.

The response of immune cells to osmotic stress is regulated by nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), a transcription factor that induces the expression of hyperosmolarity-responsive genes and stimulates cytokine production. We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Brx [also known as protein kinase A-anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13)] is essential for the expression of nfat5 in response to osmotic stress, thus transmitting the extracellular hyperosmolarity signal and enabling differentiation of splenic B cells and production of immunoglobulin. This process required the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NFAT5 and involved a physical interaction between Brx and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 4 (JIP4), a scaffold molecule specific to activation of the p38 MAPK cascade.

65,19251644,"Previous studies revealed roles for RNA interference (RNAi) in the immediate cellular response to viral infection in plants, nematodes and flies. However, little is known about how RNAi combats viruses during persistent or latent infections. Our analysis of small RNAs cloned from Drosophila cells latently infected with Flock House Virus (FHV) failed to reveal signatures of bulk degradation of the viral genome. Instead, this + strand virus specifically generated Dicer-2-dependent, 21-nucleotide siRNAs that derived in equal proportion from + and - strands. Curiously, luciferase reporters that are fully complementary to abundant viral siRNAs were poorly repressed. Moreover, although the viral siRNAs that were incorporated into an effector complex associated with Argonaute2, bulk FHV siRNAs in latently infected cells were not loaded into any Argonaute protein. Together, these data suggest that direct dicing of viral replication intermediates plays an important role in maintaining the latent viral state. In addition, the denial of bulk viral siRNAs from effector complexes suggests that criteria beyond the structural competency of RNA duplexes influence the assembly of functional silencing complexes.","['Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Ribonuclease III', 'Virus Latency', 'Virus Replication']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Helical net', 'Helical wheel', 'RNA', 'Format detection', 'Citation', 'Protein identification', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecule data processing', 'Small molecules', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'DNA replication and recombination']"
66,19270160,"In many species, a dosage compensation complex (DCC) is targeted to X chromosomes of one sex to equalize levels of X-gene products between males (1X) and females (2X). Here we identify cis-acting regulatory elements that target the Caenorhabditis elegans X chromosome for repression by the DCC. The DCC binds to discrete, dispersed sites on X of two types. rex sites (recruitment elements on X) recruit the DCC in an autonomous, DNA sequence-dependent manner using a 12-base-pair (bp) consensus motif that is enriched on X. This motif is critical for DCC binding, is clustered in rex sites, and confers much of X-chromosome specificity. Motif variants enriched on X by 3.8-fold or more are highly predictive (95%) for rex sites. In contrast, dox sites (dependent on X) lack the X-enriched variants and cannot bind the DCC when detached from X. dox sites are more prevalent than rex sites and, unlike rex sites, reside preferentially in promoters of some expressed genes. These findings fulfill predictions for a targeting model in which the DCC binds to recruitment sites on X and disperses to discrete sites lacking autonomous recruitment ability. To relate DCC binding to function, we identified dosage-compensated and noncompensated genes on X. Unexpectedly, many genes of both types have bound DCC, but many do not, suggesting the DCC acts over long distances to repress X-gene expression. Remarkably, the DCC binds to autosomes, but at far fewer sites and rarely at consensus motifs. DCC disruption causes opposite effects on expression of X and autosomal genes. The DCC thus acts at a distance to impact expression throughout the genome.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome, Helminth', 'Male', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Protein Binding', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'X Chromosome']","['Phosphorylation sites', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'protein', 'consensus', 'Sequence', 'Consensus-based sequence alignment', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic code', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'MAT', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction (RNA-cis)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report']"

68,19286668,"Altered gene expression in tumors can be caused by copy number alterations to DNA or mutation affecting coding or regulatory regions of genes. However, epigenetic events may also influence gene expression. Malignant cells can show major disruptions in DNA methylation profiles, which are manifested as aberrant hypermethylation or as hypomethylation of gene promoters, as well as global genomic hypomethylation. In this study we performed integrative whole-genome analysis of DNA copy number, promoter methylation and gene expression using 10 osteosarcomas. We identified significant changes including: hypomethylation, gain, and overexpression of histone cluster 2 genes at chromosome 1q21.1-q21.3; loss of chromosome 8p21.2-p21.3 and underexpression of DOCK5 and TNFRSF10A/D genes; and amplification-related overexpression of RUNX2 at chromosome 6p12.3-p21.1. Amplification and overexpression of RUNX2 could disrupt G2/M cell cycle checkpoints, and downstream osteosarcoma-specific changes, such as failure of bone differentiation and genomic polyploidization. Failure of DOCK5-signaling, together with p53 and TNFRSF10A/D-related cell cycle and death pathways, may play a critical role in abrogating apoptosis.

69,19293335,"Recent studies have documented various roles of adrenal corticosteroid signaling in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. It is known that glucocorticoids and aldosterone are able to bind glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor, and these ligand-receptor interactions are redundant. It, therefore, has been impossible to delineate how these nuclear receptors couple with corticosteroid ligands and differentially regulate gene expression for operation of their distinct functions in the heart. Here, to particularly define the role of GR in cardiac muscle cells, we applied a ligand-based approach involving the GR-specific agonist cortivazol (CVZ) and the GR antagonist RU-486 and performed microarray analysis using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We indicated that glucocorticoids appear to be a major determinant of GR-mediated gene expression when compared with aldosterone. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes highlighted numerous roles of glucocorticoids in various aspects of cardiac physiology. At first, we identified that glucocorticoids, via GR, induce mRNA and protein expression of a transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 15 and its downstream target genes, including branched-chain aminotransferase 2, a key enzyme for amino acid catabolism in the muscle. CVZ treatment or overexpression of KLF15 decreased cellular branched-chain amino acid concentrations and introduction of small-interfering RNA against KLF15 cancelled these CVZ actions in cardiomyocytes. Second, glucocorticoid-GR signaling promoted gene expression of the enzymes involved in the prostaglandin biosynthesis, including cyclooxygenase-2 and phospholipase A2 in cardiomyocytes. Together, we may conclude that GR signaling should have distinct roles for maintenance of cardiac function, for example, in amino acid catabolism and prostaglandin biosynthesis in the heart.","['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heart', 'Hormone Antagonists', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Ligands', 'Mifepristone', 'Myocardium', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Pregnatrienes', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid', 'Transfection']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory information management', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell cycle', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'UniSTS accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'PSI MI XML (MIF)', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Domainatrix signature', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Selection detection', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription']"

The assessment of cell proliferation and colony-forming potential revealed that the hypoxic conditions corresponding to 1% oxygen played a major role. The chondrogenic inducibility, examined by high-density pellet model, however, did not improve on hypoxic preconditioning. While the microarray analysis revealed a distinctive inter-donor variability, the exposure to 1% hypoxia superseded the biological variability and produced a specific expression profile with 2581 significantly regulated genes and substantial functional enrichment in the pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, exposure to 1% oxygen resulted in upregulation of factors related to angiogenesis and cell growth.

Transcriptomes of mid-exponential- and stationary-phase cells were evaluated after 10 min in model apple juice (pH 3.5) using microarrays probing 4,886 open reading frames. A total of 331 genes were significantly induced upon exposure of cells to model apple juice, including genes involved in the acid, osmotic, and oxidative stress responses as well as the envelope stress response. Acid and osmotic stress response genes, including asr, osmC, osmB, and osmY, were significantly induced in response to model apple juice. Multiple envelope stress responses were activated as evidenced by increased expression of CpxR and Rcs phosphorelay-controlled genes. Genes controlled by CpxR (cpxP, degP, and htpX) were significantly induced 2- to 15-fold upon exposure to apple juice. Inactivation of CpxRA resulted in a significant decrease in survival of O157:H7 in model apple juice compared to the isogenic parent strain.

To identify candidate genes to supply this promoter, microarrays were designed from a horn fly expressed sequence tag (EST) database and probed to identify female-specific and larval-specific gene expression. Analysis of dye swap experiments found 432 and 417 transcripts whose expression levels were higher or lower in adult female flies, respectively, compared with adult male flies. Additionally, 419 and 871 transcripts were identified whose expression levels were higher or lower in first-instar larvae compared with adult flies, respectively. Three transcripts were expressed more highly in adult females flies compared with adult males and also higher in the first-instar larval lifestage compared with adult flies. One of these transcripts, a putative nanos ortholog, has a high female-to-male expression ratio, a moderate expression level in first-instar larvae, and has been well characterized in Drosophila. melanogaster (Meigen).

73,19448672,"Inappropriate kinase expression and subsequent promiscuous activity defines the transformation of many solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus, the expression of novel tumor-associated kinases has the potential to dramatically shape tumor cell behavior. Further, identifying tumor-associated kinases can lend insight into patterns of tumor growth and characteristics. Here, we report the identification of the RTK-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2), a new tumor-associated kinase in RCC cell lines and primary tumors. Ror2 is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase with physiological expression normally seen in the embryonic kidney. However, in RCC, Ror2 expression correlated with expression of genes involved at the extracellular matrix, including Twist and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). Expression of MMP2 in RCC cells was suppressed by Ror2 knockdown, placing Ror2 as a mediator of MMP2 regulation in RCC and a potential regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling. The suppression of Ror2 not only inhibited cell migration, but also inhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model. These findings suggest a novel pathway of tumor-promoting activity by Ror2 within a subset of renal carcinomas, with significant implications for unraveling the tumorigenesis of RCC.","['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden', 'Twist-Related Protein 1']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plotting', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'SAGE experimental data', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Protein data', 'Protein report']"

We investigated whether ACTC can replace ACTA1 in postnatal skeletal muscle. Two ACTC transgenic mouse lines were crossed with Acta1 knockout mice (which all die by 9 d after birth). Offspring resulting from the cross with the high expressing line survive to old age, and their skeletal muscles show no gross pathological features.

In addition, we showed for the first time that a low dose of ionizing radiation (2 mGy) can induce a significant response at the transcriptomic level, although no change in cell viability and only a few significant differentially expressed proteins were observed. From the MELiSSA perspective, we could argue the effect of microgravity to be minimized, whereas R. rubrum S1H could be more sensitive to ionizing radiation during long-term space exploration mission.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteome', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Rhodospirillum rubrum', 'Space Flight', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Weightlessness']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'RH scores', 'ACE', 'Flies', 'Light microscopy', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model accession', 'Position weight matrix', 'Peptide molecular weights', 'Phylogenetic character weights']"

77,19593404,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an oxidant-responsive transcription factor known to induce detoxifying and antioxidant genes. Cigarette smoke, with its large oxidant content, is a major stress on the cells of small airway epithelium, which are vulnerable to oxidant damage. We assessed the role of cigarette smoke in activation of Nrf2 in the human small airway epithelium in vivo. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to sample the small airway epithelium in healthy-nonsmoker and healthy-smoker, and gene expression was assessed using microarrays. Relative to nonsmokers, Nrf2 protein in the small airway epithelium of smokers was activated and localized in the nucleus. The human homologs of 201 known murine Nrf2-modulated genes were identified, and 13 highly smoking-responsive Nrf2-modulated genes were identified. Construction of an Nrf2 index to assess the expression levels of these 13 genes in the airway epithelium of smokers showed coordinate control, an observation confirmed by quantitative PCR. This coordinate level of expression of the 13 Nrf2-modulated genes was independent of smoking history or demographic parameters. The Nrf2 index was used to identify two novel Nrf2-modulated, smoking-responsive genes, pirin (PIR) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1-family polypeptide A4 (UGT1A4). Both genes were demonstrated to contain functional antioxidant response elements in the promoter region. These observations suggest that Nrf2 plays an important role in regulating cellular defenses against smoking in the highly vulnerable small airway epithelium cells, and that there is variability within the human population in the Nrf2 responsiveness to oxidant burden.","['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bronchi', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Dioxygenases', 'Epithelium', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidants', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smoking']","['Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'InChI', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Image metadata', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein domains', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"
78,19625612,"Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was performed for a 4-h period to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 +/- 0.1 g/g body wt) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon study completion. An immediate-early growth response was present in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (FOS, JUN, activating transcription factor 3, and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus muscle. Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber-specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A and 2B, fast troponins T(3) and I, alpha-tropomyosin, muscle creatine kinase, and parvalbumin) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain-1beta/slow, troponin C slow, and tropomyosin 3y) in the EDL versus soleus muscles. Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration in stimulated versus control muscles, whereas ultrastructural analysis showed no evidence of myofiber damage after stimulation. Multiple fiber type-specific transcription factors (tea domain family member 1, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha and -beta, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (Kruppel-like factor 4; SRY box containing 17; transcription factor 15; PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 1; and embryonic lethal, abnormal vision). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or genes activated in our parallel experiments of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (cyclins A(2), B(2), C, and E(1) and MyoD) were differentially increased in the stimulated muscles. These results indicated that the molecular onset of fast to slow phenotype conversion occurred in the EDL within 4 h of stimulation without injury or satellite cell recruitment. This conversion was associated with the expression of phenotype-specific transcription factors from resident fiber myonuclei, including the activation of nascent developmental transcriptional programs.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophysiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hindlimb', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Physiology', 'Physiology parameter', 'Biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Concentration', 'Relation extraction', 'Information extraction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', '18O labeling', 'Metabolic labeling', 'Data mining', 'Retention time prediction', 'RNA-seq time series data analysis']"
79,19749747,"An important feature of the cerebral cortex is its layered organization, which is modulated in an area-specific manner. We found that the transcription factor AP2gamma regulates laminar fate in a region-specific manner. Deletion of AP2gamma (also known as Tcfap2c) during development resulted in a specific reduction of upper layer neurons in the occipital cortex, leading to impaired function and enhanced plasticity of the adult visual cortex. AP2gamma functions in apical progenitors, and its absence resulted in mis-specification of basal progenitors in the occipital cortex at the time at which upper layer neurons were generated. AP2gamma directly regulated the basal progenitor fate determinants Math3 (also known as Neurod4) and Tbr2, and its overexpression promoted the generation of layer II/III neurons in a time- and region-specific manner. Thus, AP2gamma acts as a regulator of basal progenitor fate, linking regional and laminar specification in the mouse developing cerebral cortex.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Evoked Potentials, Visual', 'Eye Proteins', 'Fetus', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurogenesis', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Photic Stimulation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Repressor Proteins', 'T-Box Domain Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Count matrix', 'Ion counting', 'Spectral counting', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Visualisation', 'Data visualisation', 'Amino acid pair-wise contact potentials', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Job status', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'GEN', ""Ensembl ID ('Macaca mulatta')"", 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Simulation', 'Simulation analysis', 'Statistical calculation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Protein report', 'Selection detection', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transposon prediction', 'Tumor annotation']"

They are responsible for central nervous system (CNS) remyelination, and likely contribute to the astrogliotic response to brain injury and degeneration as well. Adult human GPCs are biased to differentiate as oligodendrocytes and elaborate new myelin, and yet they retain multilineage plasticity, and can give rise to neurons as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes once removed from the adult parenchymal environment. GPCs retain strong mechanisms for cell-autonomous self-renewal, and yet both their phenotype and fate may be dictated by their microenvironment. Using the transcriptional profiles of acutely isolated GPCs, we have begun to understand the operative ligand-receptor interactions involved in these processes, and have identified several key signaling pathways by which adult human GPCs may be reliably instructed to either oligodendrocytic or astrocytic fate. In addition, we have noted significant differences between the expressed genes and dominant signaling pathways of fetal and adult human GPCs, as well as between rodent and human GPCs. The latter data in particular call into question therapeutic strategies predicated solely upon data obtained using rodents, while perhaps highlighting the extent to which evolution has been attended by the phylogenetic modification of glial phenotype and function.","['Adult Stem Cells', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neuroglia']","['Regenerative medicine', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID']"

Although a role for PARP-1 in gene regulation has been well established, the role of PARG is less clear. To investigate how PARP-1 and PARG coordinately regulate global patterns of gene expression, we used short hairpin RNAs to stably knock down PARP-1 or PARG in MCF-7 cells followed by expression microarray analyses. Correlation analyses showed that the majority of genes affected by the knockdown of one factor were similarly affected by the knockdown of the other factor. The most robustly regulated common genes were enriched for stress-response and metabolic functions. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, PARP-1 and PARG localized to the promoters of positively and negatively regulated target genes. The levels of chromatin-bound PARG at a given promoter generally correlated with the levels of PARP-1 across the subset of promoters tested. For about half of the genes tested, the binding of PARP-1 at the promoter was dependent on the binding of PARG. Experiments using stable re-expression of short hairpin RNA-resistant catalytic mutants showed that PARP-1 and PARG enzymatic activities are required for some, but not all, target genes. Collectively, our results indicate that PARP-1 and PARG, nuclear enzymes with opposing enzymatic activities, localize to target promoters and act in a similar, rather than antagonistic, manner to regulate gene expression.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Polymers', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['BEAST', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic engineering', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Read mapping', 'Oligonucleotide probe data', 'PCR experiment', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Ribosomes', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

The investigated rice FOX Arabidopsis line showed prominent changes in the levels of metabolites related to nitrogen metabolism. The transcriptomic data as well as the results from the metabolite analysis of the Arabidopsis At-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressor plants were consistent with these findings. Furthermore, the metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of the Os-LBD37/ASL39-overexpressing rice plants indicated that Os-LBD37/ASL39 is associated with processes related to nitrogen metabolism in rice.

The SAGE method provides relative expression levels, which allows us to rank order the expressed genes. We found that a large number of ribosomal proteins were expressed at high levels, while various components of the proteosome were expressed at low levels. The only identifiable transmembrane signaling system components expressed in amoebae are related to quorum sensing, and their expression levels were relatively low. The most highly expressed gene in the amoeba transcriptome, dutA untranslated RNA, is a molecule with unknown function that may serve as an inhibitor of translation.

Its exact biological function and molecular targets are unclear, however. Here, we assessed the relevance of tumor cell expression of podoplanin in cancer metastasis to lymph nodes, using a human MCF7 breast carcinoma xenograft model. We found that podoplanin expression promoted tumor cell motility in vitro and, unexpectedly, increased tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis to regional lymph nodes in vivo, without promoting primary tumor growth. Importantly, high cancer cell expression levels of podoplanin correlated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival times in a large cohort of 252 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients. Based on comparative transcriptional profiling of tumor xenografts, we identified endothelin-1, villin-1, and tenascin-C as potential mediators of podoplanin-induced tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis.

The T3pi showed very high expression of microRNAs, miR-186, miR-199a and miR-339, which down-regulated the expression of LIN28, PRDM1, CALB1, GCNT2, RBM47, PLEKHH1, RBPMS2 and PAK6. Therefore, these microRNAs and their target genes are very likely to play important regulatory roles in the development of pancreas and/or differentiation of islet cells, and they may be manipulated to increase the proportion of beta cells and insulin synthesis in the differentiated T3pi for cell therapy of type I diabetics.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'MicroRNAs', 'RNA, Messenger']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
92,21406397,"Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the de novo synthesis of purines, thymidylate, and S-adenosylmethionine, the primary cellular methyl donor. Impairments in folate metabolism diminish cellular methylation potential and genome stability, which are risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). Cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1) regulates the partitioning of folate-activated one-carbons between thymidylate and S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis. Therefore, changes in SHMT1 expression enable the determination of the specific contributions made by thymidylate and S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis to CRC risk. Shmt1 hemizygosity was associated with a decreased capacity for thymidylate synthesis due to downregulation of enzymes in its biosynthetic pathway, namely thymidylate synthase and cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Significant Shmt1-dependent changes to methylation capacity, gene expression, and purine synthesis were not observed. Shmt1 hemizygosity was associated with increased risk for intestinal cancer in Apc(min)(/+) mice through a gene-by-diet interaction, indicating that the capacity for thymidylate synthesis modifies susceptibility to intestinal cancer in Apc(min)(/+) mice.","['Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colon', 'Diet', 'Enterocytes', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Folic Acid', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Heterozygote', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Purines', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Thymine Nucleotides']","['protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein atom', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Color', 'Ecology', 'Oncology', 'NET', 'Nucleic acid folding', 'Nucleic acid folding analysis', 'Nucleic acid folding report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Mutation ID', 'Strain data format', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'pure', 'pure protein', 'pure rna', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'nucleotide', 'pure nucleotide']"

We have mapped the interactions between down-regulated miRNAs and overexpressed target protein-coding genes in murine and human lymphomas. Myc, one of the hallmark oncogenes in these lymphomas, stands out as the up-regulated gene with the highest number of genetic interactions with down-regulated miRNAs in mouse lymphomas. The regulation of Myc by several of these miRNAs is confirmed by cellular and reporter assays. The same approach identifies MYC and multiple Myc targets as a preferential target of down-regulated miRNAs in human Burkitt lymphoma, a pathology characterized by translocated MYC oncogenes. These results indicate that several miRNAs must be coordinately down-regulated to enhance critical oncogenes, such as Myc. Some of these Myc-targeting miRNAs are repressed by Myc, suggesting that these tumors are a consequence of the unbalanced activity of Myc versus miRNAs.","['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'RNA, Neoplasm']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"

The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of 5mC-hydroxylases, which convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), offers a way for dynamic regulation of DNA methylation. Here we report that Tet1 binds to unmodified C or 5mC- or 5hmC-modified CpG-rich DNA through its CXXC domain. Genome-wide mapping of Tet1 and 5hmC reveals mechanisms by which Tet1 controls 5hmC and 5mC levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We also uncover a comprehensive gene network influenced by Tet1. Collectively, our data suggest that Tet1 controls DNA methylation both by binding to CpG-rich regions to prevent unwanted DNA methyltransferase activity, and by converting 5mC to 5hmC through hydroxylase activity. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 targets, ultimately contributing to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development.","['5-Methylcytosine', 'Animals', 'Cytosine', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Mice', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']","['DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cytometry', 'Cytoband position', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA translation', 'DNA', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein function prediction', 'Function analysis', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"

Thus, a fundamental question is whether autism represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disorder in which the myriad genetic or environmental risk factors perturb common underlying molecular pathways in the brain. Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis. Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning. We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1 (also known as FOX1), and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of A2BP1-dependent alternative exons in the ASD brain. Moreover, using a published autism genome-wide association study (GWAS) data set, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism. In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic aetiology for this process.

Both DARPP-32 and neural plasticity regulator activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (ARC) were up-regulated in lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons by sodium deficiency. Administration of dopamine D1 (SCH23390) and D2 receptor (raclopride) antagonists reduced gratification of sodium appetite triggered by sodium deficiency. SCH23390 was specific, having no effect on osmotic-induced water drinking, whereas raclopride also reduced water intake. D1 receptor KO mice had normal sodium appetite, indicating compensatory regulation. Appetite was insensitive to SCH23390, confirming the absence of off-target effects. Bilateral microinjection of SCH23390 (100 nM in 200 nL) into rats' lateral hypothalamus greatly reduced sodium appetite. Gene set enrichment analysis in hypothalami of mice with sodium appetite showed significant enrichment of gene sets previously linked to addiction (opiates and cocaine). This finding of concerted gene regulation was attenuated on gratification with perplexingly rapid kinetics of only 10 min, anteceding significant absorption of salt from the gut. Salt appetite and hedonic liking of salt taste have evolved over >100 million y (e.g., being present in Metatheria).

ChIP-seq of EBNA2 and RBPJ sites in LCL DNA found EBNA2 at 5,151 and RBPJ at 10,529 sites. EBNA2 sites were enriched for RBPJ (78%), early B-cell factor (EBF, 39%), RUNX (43%), ETS (39%), NFκB (22%), and PU.1 (22%) motifs. These motif associations were confirmed by LCL RBPJ ChIP-seq finding 72% RBPJ occupancy and Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements LCL ChIP-seq finding EBF, NFκB RELA, and PU.1 at 54%, 31%, and 17% of EBNA2 sites. EBNA2 and RBPJ were predominantly at intergene and intron sites and only 14% at promoter sites. K-means clustering of EBNA2 site transcription factors identified RELA-ETS, EBF-RUNX, EBF, ETS, RBPJ, and repressive RUNX clusters, which ranked from highest to lowest in H3K4me1 signals and nucleosome depletion, indicative of active chromatin. Surprisingly, although quantitatively less, the same genome sites in RBLs exhibited similar high-level H3K4me1 signals and nucleosome depletion. The EBV genome also had an LMP1 promoter EBF site, which proved critical for EBNA2 activation. LCL HiC data mapped intergenic EBNA2 sites to EBNA2 up-regulated genes. FISH and chromatin conformation capture linked EBNA2/RBPJ enhancers 428 kb 5' of MYC to MYC.

Patient-derived clear cell and serous ovarian tumors were grafted under the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the identified pathway. We identified major activated pathways in clear cells involving in hypoxic cell growth, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism not seen in other histotypes. Knockdown of key genes in these pathways sensitized clear cell ovarian cancer cell lines to hypoxia/glucose deprivation. In vivo experiments using patient derived tumors demonstrate that clear cell tumors are exquisitely sensitive to antiangiogenesis therapy (i.e. sunitinib) compared with serous tumors.

We analyzed the composition, interacting proteins, and genomic distribution of SAGA in muscle and neuronal tissue of late stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos. The subunit composition of SAGA was the same in each tissue; however, SAGA was associated with considerably more transcription factors in muscle compared with neurons. Consistent with this finding, SAGA was found to occupy more genes specifically in muscle than in neurons. Strikingly, SAGA occupancy was not limited to enhancers and promoters but primarily colocalized with RNA polymerase II within transcribed sequences. SAGA binding peaks at the site of RNA polymerase pausing at the 5' end of transcribed sequences. In addition, many tissue-specific SAGA-bound genes required its ubiquitin protease activity for full expression.

Importantly, we also identify genomic features called transcriptional initiation platforms (TIPs) that are characterized by large areas of Pol II and GTF recruitment at promoters, intergenic and intragenic regions. TIPs show variable widths (0.4-10 kb) and correlate with high CpG content and increased tissue specificity at promoters.

108,21862669,"R1R2R3-Myb proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved class of Myb family proteins important for cell cycle regulation and differentiation in eukaryotic cells. In plants, this class of Myb proteins are believed to regulate the transcription of G2/M phase-specific genes by binding to common cis-elements, called mitosis-specific activator (MSA) elements. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), MYB3R1 and MYB3R4 act as transcriptional activators and positively regulate cytokinesis by activating the transcription of KNOLLE, which encodes a cytokinesis-specific syntaxin. Here, we show that the double mutation myb3r1 myb3r4 causes pleiotropic developmental defects, some of which are due to deficiency of KNOLLE whereas other are not, suggesting that multiple target genes are involved. Consistently, microarray analysis of the double mutant revealed altered expression of many genes, among which G2/M-specific genes showed significant overrepresentation of the MSA motif and a strong tendency to be down-regulated by the double mutation. Our results demonstrate, on a genome-wide level, the importance of the MYB3R-MSA pathway for regulating G2/M-specific transcription. In addition, MYB3R1 and MYB3R4 may have diverse roles during plant development by regulating G2/M-specific genes with various functions as well as genes possibly unrelated to the cell cycle.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Caffeine', 'Cell Division', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Diploidy', 'Down-Regulation', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Qa-SNARE Proteins', 'Seedlings', 'Seeds', 'Trans-Activators']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'CAF', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line report', 'Sequence', 'Conserved transcription regulatory sequence identification', 'Protein conserved site signature', 'DIP ID', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Phasing', 'Translation phase specification', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'medline', 'PubMed XML', 'Medline UI', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor accession']"

110,21921043,"Despite an increase in survival for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the outcome after relapse is poor. To understand the genetic events that contribute to relapse and chemoresistance and identify novel targets of therapy, 3 high-throughput assays were used to identify genetic and epigenetic changes at relapse. Using matched diagnosis/relapse bone marrow samples from children with relapsed B-precursor ALL, we evaluated gene expression, copy number abnormalities (CNAs), and DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis revealed a signature of differentially expressed genes from diagnosis to relapse that is different for early (< 36 months) and late (≥ 36 months) relapse. CNA analysis discovered CNAs that were shared at diagnosis and relapse and others that were new lesions acquired at relapse. DNA methylation analysis found increased promoter methylation at relapse. There were many genetic alterations that evolved from diagnosis to relapse, and in some cases these genes had previously been associated with chemoresistance. Integration of the results from all 3 platforms identified genes of potential interest, including CDKN2A, COL6A2, PTPRO, and CSMD1. Although our results indicate that a diversity of genetic changes are seen at relapse, integration of gene expression, CNA, and methylation data suggest a possible convergence on the WNT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.","['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recurrence']","['Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Tool', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'DNA variation', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Maximum occurrence analysis', 'Citation', 'Ion counting']"
111,22012618,"The aberrant expression of an oncogenic ETS transcription factor is implicated in the progression of the majority of prostate cancers, 40% of melanomas, and most cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and Ewing's sarcoma. Chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer result in overexpression of any one of four ETS transcription factors. How these four oncogenic ETS genes differ from the numerous other ETS genes expressed in normal prostate and contribute to tumor progression is not understood. We report that these oncogenic ETS proteins, but not other ETS factors, enhance prostate cell migration. Genome-wide binding analysis matched this specific biological function to occupancy of a unique set of genomic sites highlighted by the presence of ETS- and AP-1-binding sequences. ETS/AP-1-binding sequences are prototypical RAS-responsive elements, but oncogenic ETS proteins activated a RAS/MAPK transcriptional program in the absence of MAPK activation. Thus, overexpression of oncogenic ETS proteins can replace RAS/MAPK pathway activation in prostate cells. The genomic description of this ETS/AP-1-regulated, RAS-responsive, gene expression program provides a resource for understanding the role of these ETS factors in both an oncogenic setting and the developmental processes where these genes normally function.","['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'ras Proteins']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence data', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Kinase name', 'Protein databases', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
112,22039463,"Analysis with DNA-microrrays and real time PCR show that several genes involved in the thyroid hormone cascade, such as deiodinase 2 and 3 (Dio2 and Dio3) are differentially regulated by the circadian clock and by changes of the ambient light. The expression level of Dio2 in adult rats (2-3 months of age) kept continuously in darkness is modulated by the circadian clock and is up-regulated by 2 fold at midday. When the diurnal ambient light was on, the expression level of Dio2 increased by 4-8 fold and a consequent increase of the related protein was detected around the nuclei of retinal photoreceptors and of neurons in inner and outer nuclear layers. The expression level of Dio3 had a different temporal pattern and was down-regulated by diurnal light. Our results suggest that DIO2 and DIO3 have a role not only in the developing retina but also in the adult retina and are powerfully regulated by light. As the thyroid hormone is a ligand-inducible transcription factor controlling the expression of several target genes, the transcriptional activation of Dio2 could be a novel genomic component of light adaptation.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'DNA Primers', 'Darkness', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iodide Peroxidase', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retina', 'Thyroid Hormones']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Protein ID (PeroxiBase)', 'Light microscopy', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data']"

Combined with stem cell technology, 3D cell cultures can provide a promising alternative for use in cell-based assays or biosensors in non-clinical drug discovery studies. To advance 3D culture technology, a case has been made for identifying and validating three-dimensionality biomarkers. With this goal in mind, we conducted a transcriptomic expression comparison among neural progenitor cells cultured on 2D substrates, 3D porous polystyrene scaffolds, and as 3D neurospheres (in vivo surrogate). Up-regulation of cytokines as a group in 3D and neurospheres was observed. A group of 13 cytokines were commonly up-regulated in cells cultured in polystyrene scaffolds and neurospheres, suggesting potential for any or a combination from this list to serve as three-dimensionality biomarkers.

117,22249249,"Multiple DNA methylation changes in the cancer methylome are associated with the acquisition of drug resistance; however it remains uncertain how many represent critical DNA methylation drivers of chemoresistance. Using isogenic, cisplatin-sensitive/resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and inducing resensitizaton with demethylating agents, we aimed to identify consistent methylation and expression changes associated with chemoresistance. Using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling across 27 578 CpG sites, we identified loci at 4092 genes becoming hypermethylated in chemoresistant A2780/cp70 compared with the parental-sensitive A2780 cell line. Hypermethylation at gene promoter regions is often associated with transcriptional silencing; however, expression of only 245 of these hypermethylated genes becomes downregulated in A2780/cp70 as measured by microarray expression profiling. Treatment of A2780/cp70 with the demethylating agent 2-deoxy-5'-azacytidine induces resensitization to cisplatin and re-expression of 41 of the downregulated genes. A total of 13/41 genes were consistently hypermethylated in further independent cisplatin-resistant A2780 cell derivatives. CpG sites at 9 of the 13 genes (ARHGDIB, ARMCX2, COL1A, FLNA, FLNC, MEST, MLH1, NTS and PSMB9) acquired methylation in ovarian tumours at relapse following chemotherapy or chemoresistant cell lines derived at the time of patient relapse. Furthermore, 5/13 genes (ARMCX2, COL1A1, MDK, MEST and MLH1) acquired methylation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer-sustaining (side population) cells. MLH1 has a direct role in conferring cisplatin sensitivity when reintroduced into cells in vitro.

Expression of surface markers, genes and hypoxia were assessed to characterize the spheroids and drug induced cytotoxicity was evaluated based on fluorescein diacetate (FDA) conversion by viable cells to fluorescent fluorescein or by direct measurement of fluorescence of GFP marked cells after a 72 h drug incubation. The cells reproducibly formed spheroids in the NanoCulture® plates with tight cell-attachment after 6 days. Cells in spheroids showed geno- and phenotypical properties reminiscent of hypoxic stem cells. Monolayer cultured cells were sensitive to standard and investigational drugs, whereas the spheroids gradually turned resistant.

Here, we show that microRNA 34 (miR-34) is significantly induced by BMP2 during osteoblast differentiation. In vivo, osteoblast-specific gain of miR-34c in mice leads to an age-dependent osteoporosis due to the defective mineralization and proliferation of osteoblasts and increased osteoclastogenesis. In osteoblasts, miR-34c targets multiple components of the Notch signaling pathway, including Notch1, Notch2 and Jag1 in a direct manner, and influences osteoclast differentiation in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-34c is critical during osteoblastogenesis in part by regulating Notch signaling in bone homeostasis. Furthermore, miR-34c-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of Notch signaling in osteoblasts is one possible mechanism to modulate the proliferative effect of Notch in the committed osteoblast progenitors which may be important in the pathogenesis of osteosarcomas. Therefore, understanding the functional interaction of miR-34 and Notch signaling in normal bone development and in bone cancer could potentially lead to therapies modulating miR-34 signaling.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptor, Notch2', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Genetic map', 'Phylogenetic data', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Proteogenomics', 'geneseq', 'Proteins', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

By examining midlife hepatic gene expressions in mice under different dietary conditions, which resulted in different lifespans and aging-related phenotypes, we were able to identify genes and pathways that modulate the aging process. We found that pathways transcriptionally correlated with diet-modulated lifespan and physiological changes were enriched for lifespan-modifying genes. Intriguingly, mitochondrial gene expression correlated with lifespan and anticorrelated with aging-related pathological changes, whereas peroxisomal gene expression showed an opposite trend. Both organelles produce reactive oxygen species, a proposed causative factor of aging. This finding implicates a contribution of peroxisome to aging. Consistent with this hypothesis, lowering the expression levels of peroxisome proliferation genes decreased the cellular peroxide levels and extended the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.

Here we have used a combination of global gene expression and chromatin-immunoprecipitation approaches during the early stages of haematopoietic development to define the transcriptional programme controlled by Runx1, an essential regulator of blood cell specification. Integrated analysis of these complementary genome-wide datasets allowed us to construct a global regulatory network model, which suggested that key regulators are activated sequentially during blood specification, but will ultimately collaborate to control many haematopoietically expressed genes. Using the CD41/integrin alpha 2b gene as a model, cellular and in vivo studies showed that CD41 is controlled by both Scl/Tal1 and Runx1 in fully specified blood cells, and initiation of CD41 expression in E7.5 embryos is severely compromised in the absence of Runx1. Taken together, this study represents the first global analysis of the transcriptional programme controlled by any key haematopoietic regulator during the process of early blood cell specification.

While much is known about the cellular and physiological changes that accompany immunosenescence, we know little about the genetic influences on this phenomenon. In this study we combined age-specific measurements of bacterial clearance ability following infection with whole-genome measurements of the transcriptional response to infection and wounding to identify genes that contribute to the natural variation in immunosenescence, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Twenty inbred lines derived from nature were measured for their ability to clear an Escherichia coli infection at 1 and 4 weeks of age. We used microarrays to simultaneously determine genome-wide expression profiles in infected and wounded flies at each age for 12 of these lines. Lines exhibited significant genetically based variation in bacterial clearance at both ages; however, the genetic basis of this variation changed dramatically with age. Variation in gene expression was significantly correlated with bacterial clearance ability only in the older age group. At 4 weeks of age variation in the expression of 247 genes following infection was associated with genetic variation in bacterial clearance. Functional annotation analyses implicate genes involved in energy metabolism including those in the insulin signaling/TOR pathway as having significant associations with bacterial clearance in older individuals. Given the evolutionary conservation of the genes involved in energy metabolism, our results could have important implications for understanding immunosenescence in other organisms, including humans.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Infections', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Insect', 'Genotype', 'Immunity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Wounds and Injuries']","['Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'Sample collections', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Genome map', 'Genome index', 'Genome report', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Here we report the 3.2 Å crystal structure of Kluyveromyces polysporus Argonaute (KpAGO) fortuitously complexed with guide RNA originating from small-RNA duplexes autonomously loaded by recombinant KpAGO. Despite their diverse sequences, guide-RNA nucleotides 1-8 are positioned similarly, with sequence-independent contacts to bases, phosphates and 2'-hydroxyl groups pre-organizing the backbone of nucleotides 2-8 in a near-A-form conformation. Compared with prokaryotic Argonautes, KpAGO has numerous surface-exposed insertion segments, with a cluster of conserved insertions repositioning the N domain to enable full propagation of guide-target pairing. Compared with Argonautes in inactive conformations, KpAGO has a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes an expanded and repositioned loop, which inserts an invariant glutamate into the catalytic pocket. Mutation analyses and analogies to ribonuclease H indicate that insertion of this glutamate finger completes a universally conserved catalytic tetrad, thereby activating Argonaute for RNA cleavage.","['Argonaute Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Biocatalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Eukaryotic Cells', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Kluyveromyces', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Guide, Kinetoplastida', 'Saccharomycetales']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'CATH domain ID', 'Protein domain', 'CATH domain report', 'X-ray diffraction', 'Protein structure assignment (from X-ray crystallographic data)', 'Tomography', 'Eukaryotes', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Protein signal peptide detection (eukaryotes)', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Molecular data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Sequence data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID']"

The pathogenesis of CINCA syndrome patients who carry NLRP3 mutations as somatic mosaicism has not been precisely described because of the difficulty in separating individual cells based on the presence or absence of the mutation. Here we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and nonmutant-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 2 CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPS-MPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion. We also confirmed that the existing anti-inflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for CINCA syndrome and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions.

127,22728933,"Preadipocytes secrete several WNT family proteins that act through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms to inhibit adipogenesis. The activity of WNT ligands is often decreased by secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs). Sfrp5 is strongly induced during adipocyte differentiation and increases in adipocytes during obesity, presumably to counteract WNT signaling. We tested the hypothesis that obesity-induced Sfrp5 expression promotes the development of new adipocytes by inhibiting endogenous suppressors of adipogenesis. As predicted, mice that lack functional SFRP5 were resistant to diet-induced obesity. However, counter to our hypothesis, we found that adipose tissue of SFRP5-deficient mice had similar numbers of adipocytes, but a reduction in large adipocytes. Transplantation of adipose tissue from SFRP5-deficient mice into leptin receptor-deficient mice indicated that the effects of SFRP5 deficiency are tissue-autonomous. Mitochondrial gene expression was increased in adipose tissue and cultured adipocytes from SFRP5-deficient mice. In adipocytes, lack of SFRP5 stimulated oxidative capacity through increased mitochondrial activity, which was mediated in part by PGC1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A. WNT3a also increased oxygen consumption and the expression of mitochondrial genes. Thus, our findings support a model of adipogenesis in which SFRP5 inhibits WNT signaling to suppress oxidative metabolism and stimulate adipocyte growth during obesity.","['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adipocytes', 'Adipogenesis', 'Adipose Tissue, White', 'Animals', 'Cell Enlargement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ear, External', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Glucose', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leptin', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria', 'Obesity', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt3A Protein']","['cel', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Proteins', 'Protein signature', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'geneseq', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Data management', 'Pain medicine', 'Informatics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Drug metabolism', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Transition matrix', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'MAT', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mitochondria', 'Histogram', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Generation', 'Gene tree construction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'DNA transcription', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name']"

In this study, we describe SplicerEX, a novel and uniquely motivated algorithm designed for experimental biologists that (1) detects widespread changes in mRNA isoforms from both conventional and splice sensitive microarray data, (2) automatically categorizes mechanistic changes in mRNA processing, and (3) mitigates known technological artifacts of exon array-based detection of alternative splicing resulting from 5' and 3' signal attenuation, background detection limits, and saturation of probe set signal intensity. In this study, we used SplicerEX to compare conventional and exon-based Affymetrix microarray data in a model of EBV transformation of primary human B cells. We demonstrated superior detection of 3'-located changes in mRNA processing by the Affymetrix U133 GeneChip relative to the Human Exon Array. SplicerEX-identified exon-level changes in the EBV infection model were confirmed by RT-PCR and revealed a novel set of EBV-regulated mRNA isoform changes in caspases 6, 7, and 8. Finally, SplicerEX as compared with MiDAS analysis of publicly available microarray data provided more efficiently categorized mRNA isoform changes with a significantly higher proportion of hits supported by previously annotated alternative processing events.

Microarray profiling revealed CAG-repeat-expansion-associated gene expression patterns that distinguish patient lines from controls, and early onset versus late onset HD. Differentiated HD neural cells showed disease-associated changes in electrophysiology, metabolism, cell adhesion, and ultimately cell death for lines with both medium and longer CAG repeat expansions.

130,22752426,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy, with most patients facing an adverse clinical outcome. Aberrant Notch pathway activation has been implicated in the initiation and progression of PDAC, specifically the aggressive phenotype of the disease. We used a panel of human PDAC cell lines as well as patient-derived PDAC xenografts to determine whether pharmacologic targeting of Notch pathway could inhibit PDAC growth and potentiate gemcitabine sensitivity. MRK-003, a potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitor, treatment resulted in the downregulation of nuclear Notch1 intracellular domain, inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, and reduction of tumor-initiating cells capable of extensive self-renewal. Pretreatment of PDAC cells with MRK-003 in cell culture significantly inhibited the subsequent engraftment in immunocompromised mice. MRK-003 monotherapy significantly blocked tumor growth in 5 of 9 (56%) PDAC xenografts. A combination of MRK-003 and gemcitabine showed enhanced antitumor effects compared with gemcitabine in 4 of 9 (44%) PDAC xenografts, reduced tumor cell proliferation, and induced both apoptosis and intratumoral necrosis. Gene expression analysis of untreated tumors indicated that upregulation of NF-κB pathway components was predictive of sensitivity to MRK-003, whereas upregulation in B-cell receptor signaling and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 pathway correlated with response to the combination of MRK-003 with gemcitabine.

131,22753467,"The role of the circadian clock in skin and the identity of genes participating in its chronobiology remain largely unknown, leading us to define the circadian transcriptome of mouse skin at two different stages of the hair cycle, telogen and anagen. The circadian transcriptomes of telogen and anagen skin are largely distinct, with the former dominated by genes involved in cell proliferation and metabolism. The expression of many metabolic genes is antiphasic to cell cycle-related genes, the former peaking during the day and the latter at night. Consistently, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, and S-phase are antiphasic to each other in telogen skin. Furthermore, the circadian variation in S-phase is controlled by BMAL1 intrinsic to keratinocytes, because keratinocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 obliterates time-of-day-dependent synchronicity of cell division in the epidermis leading to a constitutively elevated cell proliferation. In agreement with higher cellular susceptibility to UV-induced DNA damage during S-phase, we found that mice are most sensitive to UVB-induced DNA damage in the epidermis at night. Because in the human epidermis maximum numbers of keratinocytes go through S-phase in the late afternoon, we speculate that in humans the circadian clock imposes regulation of epidermal cell proliferation so that skin is at a particularly vulnerable stage during times of maximum UV exposure, thus contributing to the high incidence of human skin cancers.","['ARNTL Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Colchicine', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome', 'Ultraviolet Rays']","['Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Medicine', 'Pain medicine', 'Gender medicine', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Epistasis', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'MAT', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

We describe sets of genes that are up- or down-regulated in each germinal zone. These data suggest that cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix interactions promote the proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitors in the developing human neocortex.

We have previously identified 87 signature genes relevant to RPE cell differentiation and function through transcriptome analysis of both human ESC- and iPSC-derived RPE as well as normal fetal RPE. Here, we profile miRNA expression through small RNA-seq in human ESCs and their RPE derivatives. Much like conclusions drawn from our previous transcriptome analysis, we find that the overall miRNA landscape in RPE is distinct from ESCs and other differentiated somatic tissues. We also profile miRNA expression during intermediate stages of RPE differentiation and identified unique subsets of miRNAs that are gradually up- or down-regulated, suggesting that dynamic regulation of these miRNAs is associated with the RPE differentiation process. Indeed, the down-regulation of a subset of miRNAs during RPE differentiation is associated with up-regulation of RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, which is exclusively expressed in RPE. We conclude that miRNA signatures can be used to classify different degrees of in vitro differentiation of RPE from human pluripotent stem cells. We suggest that RPE-specific miRNAs likely contribute to the functional maturation of RPE in vitro, similar to the regulation of RPE-specific mRNA expression.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'MicroRNAs', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium', 'Transcriptome', 'cis-trans-Isomerases']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Epigenetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Keyword']"
136,22856327,"Stress responses play an important role in shaping species distributions and robustness to climate change. We investigated how stress responses alter the contribution of additive genetic variation to gene expression during development of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, under increased temperatures that model realistic climate change scenarios. We first measured gene expression responses in the embryos by RNA-seq to characterize molecular signatures of mild, chronic temperature stress in an unbiased manner. We found that an increase from 12 to 18 °C caused widespread alterations in gene expression including in genes involved in protein folding, RNA processing and development. To understand the quantitative genetic architecture of this response, we then focused on a well-characterized gene network involved in endomesoderm and ectoderm specification. Using a breeding design with wild-caught individuals, we measured genetic and gene-environment interaction effects on 72 genes within this network. We found genetic or maternal effects in 33 of these genes and that the genetic effects were correlated in the network. Fourteen network genes also responded to higher temperatures, but we found no significant genotype-environment interactions in any of the genes. This absence may be owing to an effective buffering of the temperature perturbations within the network. In support of this hypothesis, perturbations to regulatory genes did not affect the expression of the genes that they regulate. Together, these results provide novel insights into the relationship between environmental change and developmental evolution and suggest that climate change may not expose large amounts of cryptic genetic variation to selection in this species.","['Animals', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Climate Change', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Models, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Strongylocentrotus purpuratus', 'Systems Biology', 'Temperature']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Theoretical biology', 'Format', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate calculation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Protein interaction data', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'pure', 'Job status', 'Systems biology', 'Biology', 'Biological system modelling', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile']"
137,22863620,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease associated with neuronal cell death that is thought to involve aberrant immune responses. Here we investigated the role of innate immunity in a mouse model of ALS. We found that inflammatory monocytes were activated and that their progressive recruitment to the spinal cord, but not brain, correlated with neuronal loss. We also found a decrease in resident microglia in the spinal cord with disease progression. Prior to disease onset, splenic Ly6Chi monocytes expressed a polarized macrophage phenotype (M1 signature), which included increased levels of chemokine receptor CCR2. As disease onset neared, microglia expressed increased CCL2 and other chemotaxis-associated molecules, which led to the recruitment of monocytes to the CNS by spinal cord-derived microglia. Treatment with anti-Ly6C mAb modulated the Ly6Chi monocyte cytokine profile, reduced monocyte recruitment to the spinal cord, diminished neuronal loss, and extended survival. In humans with ALS, the analogous monocytes (CD14+CD16-) exhibited an ALS-specific microRNA inflammatory signature similar to that observed in the ALS mouse model, linking the animal model and the human disease. Thus, the profile of monocytes in ALS patients may serve as a biomarker for disease stage or progression.

140,22912406,"Bromodomain-containing proteins bind acetylated lysine residues on histone tails and are involved in the recruitment of additional factors that mediate histone modifications and enable transcription. A compound, I-BET-762, that inhibits binding of an acetylated histone peptide to proteins of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family, was previously shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory proteins by macrophages and block acute inflammation in mice. Here, we investigated the effect of short-term treatment with I-BET-762 on T-cell function. Treatment of naïve CD4(+) T cells with I-BET-762 during the first 2 d of differentiation had long-lasting effects on subsequent gene expression and cytokine production. Gene expression analysis revealed up-regulated expression of several antiinflammatory gene products, including IL-10, Lag3, and Egr2, and down-regulated expression of several proinflammatory cytokines including GM-CSF and IL-17. The short 2-d treatment with I-BET-762 inhibited the ability of antigen-specific T cells, differentiated under Th1 but not Th17 conditions in vitro, to induce pathogenesis in an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The suppressive effects of I-BET-762 on T-cell mediated inflammation in vivo were accompanied by decreased recruitment of macrophages, consistent with decreased GM-CSF production by CNS-infiltrating T cells. These effects were mimicked by an inhibitor of c-myc function, implicating reduced expression of c-myc and GM-CSF as one avenue by which I-BET-762 suppresses the inflammatory functions of T cells. Our study demonstrates that inhibiting the functions of BET-family proteins during early T-cell differentiation causes long-lasting suppression of the proinflammatory functions of Th1 cells.","['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Benzodiazepines', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Salivary alpha-Amylases', 'Thiazoles', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Histogram', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Reverse complement', 'Transcription', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Molecules', 'Gene transcription']"
141,22918865,"The fungicide fludioxonil is widely used in agriculture. Residua of this fungicide are occasionally detected in fruits and can therefore be ingested by humans. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses the target of fludioxonil, Nik1p, a type III histidine kinase involved in stress response. Inhibition of yeast and hyphae growth was hardly observable after treatment of C. albicans SC5314 with fludioxonil. As a side effect, however, we observed a concentration-dependent induction of the expression of the genes CDR1 and CDR2, encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This was independent of the presence of the target of fludioxonil as induction was also observed in a Δnik1 deletion mutant. Deletion of the CDR1 gene aggravated the inhibition of germ tube formation by fludioxonil, indicating that, in the wild-type, the fungicide was discharged from the cell by Cdr1p. Cdr1p is also known as a resistance factor of C. albicans against the commonly used antimycotic fluconazole. Thus, the effect of concurrent exposure to fludioxonil and known cargoes of ABC transporters on their extrusion and the growth of C. albicans was examined. Pre-incubation with fludioxonil decreased the export rate of rhodamine 6G. The resistance to fluconazole was increased by fludioxonil, independently of Nik1p. Therefore, exposure of C. albicans to fludioxonil may lead to increased resistance to fluconazole treatment.","['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Candida albicans', 'Candidiasis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dioxoles', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Fluconazole', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Histidine Kinase', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Protein Kinases', 'Pyrroles', 'Rhodamines']","['Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Plant biology', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Molecules', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Fungi', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Kinase name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbiology', 'Protein databases', 'Python script']"

We report here that a single member of the double bromodomain BET factors, Brdt, is a master regulator of both meiotic divisions and post-meiotic genome repackaging. Upon its activation at the onset of meiosis, Brdt drives and determines the developmental timing of a testis-specific gene expression program. In meiotic and post-meiotic cells, Brdt initiates a genuine histone acetylation-guided programming of the genome by activating essential genes and repressing a 'progenitor cells' gene expression program. At post-meiotic stages, a global chromatin hyperacetylation gives the signal for Brdt's first bromodomain to direct the genome-wide replacement of histones by transition proteins. Brdt is therefore a unique and essential regulator of male germ cell differentiation, which, by using various domains in a developmentally controlled manner, first drives a specific spermatogenic gene expression program, and later controls the tight packaging of the male genome.","['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histones', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatozoa']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Histogram', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Dermatology']"

We constructed an hfq deletion mutant (Δhfq) of S. maltophilia and compared the behaviors of wild-type and Δhfq S. maltophilia cells in a variety of assays. This revealed that S. maltophilia Hfq plays a role in biofilm formation and cell motility, as well as susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Moreover, Hfq is crucial for adhesion to bronchial epithelial cells and is required for the replication of S. maltophilia in macrophages. Differential RNA sequencing analysis (dRNA-seq) of RNA isolated from S. maltophilia wild-type and Δhfq strains showed that Hfq regulates the expression of genes encoding flagellar and fimbrial components, transmembrane proteins, and enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways. Moreover, we analyzed the expression of several sRNAs identified by dRNA-seq in wild-type and Δhfq S. maltophilia cells grown in different conditions on Northern blots.

We find that the circadian transcriptional cycle of the clock consists of three distinct phases: a poised state, a coordinated de novo transcriptional activation state, and a repressed state. Only 22% of messenger RNA (mRNA) cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms underlie the mammalian circadian clock.

Here, we investigated the role of the nucleoprotein geminin in regulating neurogenesis at a mechanistic level during both Xenopus primary neurogenesis and mammalian neuronal differentiation in vitro. The latter work utilized neural cells derived from embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells in vitro and neural stem cells from mouse forebrain. In all of these contexts, geminin antagonized the ability of neural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors to activate transcriptional programs promoting neurogenesis. Furthermore, geminin promoted a bivalent chromatin state, characterized by the presence of both activating and repressive histone modifications, at genes encoding transcription factors that promote neurogenesis. This epigenetic state restrains the expression of genes that regulate commitment of undifferentiated stem and neuronal precursor cells to neuronal lineages. However, maintaining geminin at high levels was not sufficient to prevent terminal neuronal differentiation. Therefore, these data support a model whereby geminin promotes the neuronal precursor cell state by modulating both the epigenetic status and expression of genes encoding neurogenesis-promoting factors. Additional developmental signals acting in these cells can then control their transition toward terminal neuronal or glial differentiation during mammalian neurogenesis.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Geminin', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Neural Stem Cells', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Prosencephalon', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Xenopus Proteins', 'Xenopus laevis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Data mining', 'Gemini SQLite format', 'Text mining', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Structural data', 'Structure clustering', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Protein domains', 'Electroencephalography', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', ""Ensembl ID ('Xenopus tropicalis')""]"

Furthermore, using the quantitative data we investigated the changes of cellular pathways in response to aneuploidy. This analysis revealed specific and uniform alterations in pathway regulation in cells with extra chromosomes. For example, the DNA and RNA metabolism pathways were downregulated, whereas several pathways such as energy metabolism, membrane metabolism and lysosomal pathways were upregulated.

F. novicida is closely related to F. tularensis and exhibits high virulence in mice, but it is avirulent in healthy humans. An F. novicida-specific gene cluster (FTN0451 to FTN0456) encodes two proteins with diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains that modulate the synthesis and degradation of cyclic di-GMP (cdGMP). No DGC- or PDE-encoding protein genes are present in the F. tularensis genome. F. novicida strains lacking either the two DGC/PDE genes (cdgA and cdgB) or the entire gene cluster (strain KKF457) are defective for biofilm formation. In addition, expression of CdgB or a heterologous DGC in strain KKF457 stimulated F. novicida biofilms, even in a strain lacking the biofilm regulator QseB. Genetic evidence suggests that CdgA is predominantly a PDE, while CdgB is predominantly a DGC. The F. novicida qseB strain showed reduced cdgA and cdgB transcript levels, demonstrating an F. novicida biofilm signaling cascade that controls cdGMP levels. Interestingly, KKF457 with elevated cdGMP levels exhibited a decrease in intramacrophage replication and virulence in mice, as well as increased growth yields and biofilm formation in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that cdGMP stimulated the transcription of a chitinase (ChiB) known to contribute to biofilm formation. Our results indicate that elevated cdGMP in F. novicida stimulates biofilm formation and inhibits virulence.

In an effort to better understand the control of the formation of branched fatty acids in M. luteus, the structure of FabH (MlFabH) was determined. FabH, or β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, catalyzes the initial step of fatty-acid biosynthesis: the condensation of malonyl-ACP with an acyl-CoA. Analysis of the MlFabH structure provides insights into its substrate selectivity with regard to length and branching of the acyl-CoA. The most structurally divergent region of FabH is the L9 loop region located at the dimer interface, which is involved in the formation of the acyl-binding channel and thus limits the substrate-channel size. The residue Phe336, which is positioned near the catalytic triad, appears to play a major role in branched-substrate selectivity. In addition to structural studies of MlFabH, transcriptional studies of M. luteus were also performed, focusing on the increase in the ratio of anteiso:iso-branched alkenes that was observed during the transition from early to late stationary phase.

After a seven-day recovery period, we analyzed global DNA methylation patterns in the irradiated and control cells using the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA) in combination with high-resolution microarrays. Bioinformatics analysis revealed only a small number of potential methylation changes with low fold-difference ratios in the irradiated cells. These minor methylation differences seen on the microarrays could not be verified by COBRA (combined bisulfite restriction analysis) or bisulfite sequencing of selected target loci.

Under the Songbird Neurogenomics Initiative, investigators from 11 laboratories collected brain samples from six species of songbird under a range of experimental conditions, and 488 of these samples were analyzed systematically for gene expression by microarray. ANOVA was used to test 32 planned contrasts in the data, revealing the relative impact of different factors. The brain region from which tissue was taken had the greatest influence on gene expression profile, affecting the majority of signals measured by 18,848 cDNA spots on the microarray. Social and environmental manipulations had a highly variable impact, interpreted here as a manifestation of paradoxical ""constitutive plasticity"" (fewer inducible genes) during periods of enhanced behavioral responsiveness. Several specific genes were identified that may be important in the evolution of linkages between environmental signals and behavior. The data were also analyzed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis, followed by gene ontology analysis. This revealed modules of coexpressed genes that are also enriched for specific functional annotations, such as ""ribosome"" (expressed more highly in juvenile brain) and ""dopamine metabolic process"" (expressed more highly in striatal song control nucleus area X). These results underscore the complexity of influences on neural gene expression and provide a resource for studying how these influences are integrated during natural experience.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Female', 'Food', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Male', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Songbirds', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcriptome', 'Vocalization, Animal']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction experiment', 'Environmental sciences', 'MAT', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Subcellular localisation prediction']"
155,23070853,"The identification of transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and transcriptional target genes often relies on the integration of gene expression profiling and computational cis-regulatory sequence analysis. Methods for the prediction of cis-regulatory elements can take advantage of comparative genomics to increase signal-to-noise levels. However, gene expression data are usually derived from only one species. Here we investigate tissue-specific cross-species gene expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing, combined with cross-species motif discovery. First, we compared different methods for expression level quantification and cross-species integration using Tag-seq data. Using the optimal pipeline, we derived a set of genes with conserved expression during retinal determination across Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila yakuba, and Drosophila virilis. These genes are enriched for binding sites of eye-related transcription factors including the zinc-finger Glass, a master regulator of photoreceptor differentiation. Validation of predicted Glass targets using RNA-seq in homozygous glass mutants confirms that the majority of our predictions are expressed downstream from Glass. Finally, we tested nine candidate enhancers by in vivo reporter assays and found eight of them to drive GFP in the eye disc, of which seven colocalize with the Glass protein, namely, scrt, chp, dpr10, CG6329, retn, Lim3, and dmrt99B. In conclusion, we show for the first time the combined use of cross-species expression profiling with cross-species motif discovery as a method to define a core developmental program, and we augment the candidate Glass targetome from a single known target gene, lozenge, to at least 62 conserved transcriptional targets.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Organ Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Species name', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Sequence alignment', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

In our study we applied a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis approach, MethylCap-seq, to map the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in 24 tumors and matched normal colon samples. In total, 2687 frequently hypermethylated and 468 frequently hypomethylated regions were identified, which include potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis. Hypermethylation in the tumor samples was enriched at CpG islands and gene promoters, while hypomethylation was distributed throughout the genome. Using epigenetic data from human embryonic stem cells, we show that frequently hypermethylated regions coincide with bivalent loci in human embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation is commonly thought to lead to gene silencing; however, integration of publically available gene expression data indicates that 75% of the frequently hypermethylated genes were most likely already lowly or not expressed in normal tissue.

In this study, we obtain a genome-wide view of the molecular function of LIN28A in mouse embryonic stem cells by carrying out RNA crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) and ribosome footprinting. We find that, in addition to let-7 precursors, LIN28A binds to a large number of spliced mRNAs. LIN28A recognizes AAGNNG, AAGNG, and less frequently UGUG, which are located in the terminal loop of a small hairpin. LIN28A is localized to the periendoplasmic reticulum (ER) area and inhibits translation of mRNAs that are destined for the ER, reducing the synthesis of transmembrane proteins, ER or Golgi lumen proteins, and secretory proteins.

We found that the expression of some genes related to metabolism and nervous system development and function were upregulated by zonisamide; expression of these genes was downregulated by levodopa.

We have identified Rbl1 and Rbl2, two transcription factors whose down-regulation is important for stem cell function, as TRIM71 targets in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, one of the defining features of TRIM-NHL proteins, the NHL domain, is necessary and sufficient to target TRIM71 to RNA, while the RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity is dispensable for repression. Our results reveal strong similarities between TRIM71 and Drosophila BRAT, the best-studied TRIM-NHL protein and a well-documented translational repressor, suggesting that BRAT and TRIM71 are part of a family of mRNA repressors regulating proliferation and differentiation.","['Animals', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Embryology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryo report', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'Lipoproteins', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Our findings reveal a strong link between DNMTs and transcribed loci, and that DNA methylation is not a simple sum of DNMT localization patterns. A comparison of the epigenomes of normal and cancerous stem cells, and pluripotent and differentiated states shows that the presence of at least two DNMTs is strongly associated with loci targeted for DNA hypermethylation.

Our results indicate that the transcriptome dynamics are predominantly governed by endogenous diurnal rhythms, ambient temperature, plant age, and solar radiation. The data revealed diurnal gates for environmental stimuli to influence transcription and pointed to relative influences exerted by circadian and environmental factors on different metabolic genes.

The transcriptional activity of non-replicating stationary phase cells of S. Typhimurium caused by the exposure to 45 °C and to pH 5 for 30 min was monitored by microarray hybridizations at the end of the treatment period as well as immediately and 30 minutes after conditions were set back to their initial values, 25 °C and pH 7. One hundred and two out of 120 up-regulated genes during the heat shock remained up-regulated 30 minutes after the temperature was set back to 25 °C, while only 86 out of 293 down regulated genes remained down regulated 30 minutes after the heat shock ceased. Thus, the majority of the induced genes exhibited hysteresis, i.e., they remained up-regulated after the environmental stress ceased. At 25 °C the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding for heat shock proteins was determined by the previous environment. Gene networks constructed with up-regulated genes were significantly more modular than those of down-regulated genes, implying that down-regulation was significantly less synchronized than up-regulation. The hysteretic transcriptional response to heat shock was accompanied by higher resistance to inactivation at 50 °C as well as cross-resistance to inactivation at pH 3; however, growth rates and lag times at 43 °C and at pH 4.5 were not affected. The exposure to pH 5 only caused up-regulation of 12 genes and this response was neither hysteretic nor accompanied of increased resistance to inactivation conditions. Cellular memory at the transcriptional level may represent a mechanism of adaptation to the environment and a deterministic source of variability in gene regulation.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Antifreeze Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Protein Folding', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'Concentration', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Vienna RNA concentration data', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Protein folding report', 'Protein folding analysis', 'Protein folding site prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
164,23245942,"Wnt growth factors are fundamental regulators of cell fate, but how the Wnt signal is translated into biological responses is incompletely understood. Here, we report that TAZ, a biologically potent transcriptional coactivator, serves as a downstream element of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. This function of TAZ is independent from its well-established role as mediator of Hippo signaling. In the absence of Wnt activity, the components of the β-catenin destruction complex--APC, Axin, and GSK3--are also required to keep TAZ at low levels. TAZ degradation depends on phosphorylated β-catenin that bridges TAZ to its ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP. Upon Wnt signaling, escape of β-catenin from the destruction complex impairs TAZ degradation and leads to concomitant accumulation of β-catenin and TAZ. At the genome-wide level, a substantial portion of Wnt transcriptional responses is mediated by TAZ. TAZ activation is a general feature of Wnt signaling and is functionally relevant to mediate Wnt biological effects.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Proteolysis', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin', 'gamma Catenin']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Proteins', 'Protein signature', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Tumor annotation', 'Kinase name', 'GlycoMap ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein cleavage sites and proteolysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Active site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Beta diversity data', 'Gamma diversity data']"

As it is well established that membrane glycerophospholipids (GPL) provide precursors for signaling lipids that modulate cellular functions, we studied the effect of the donor's age and cell doublings on the GPL profile of human bone marrow MSC (hBMSC). The hBMSCs, which were harvested from five young and five old adults, showed clear compositional changes during expansion seen at the level of lipid classes, lipid species, and acyl chains. The ratio of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylserine increased toward the late-passage samples. Furthermore, 20:4n-6-containing species of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine accumulated while the species containing monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) decreased during passaging. Additionally, in the total FA pool of the cells, 20:4n-6 increased, which happened at the expense of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs, especially 22:6n-3. The GPL and FA correlated with the decreased immunosuppressive capacity of hBMSCs during expansion. Our observations were further supported by alterations in the gene expression levels of several enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and immunomodulation.

170,23295674,"Single-cell genomics is revolutionizing basic genome research and clinical genetic diagnosis. However, none of the current research or clinical methods for single-cell analysis distinguishes between the analysis of a cell in G1-, S- or G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. Here, we demonstrate by means of array comparative genomic hybridization that charting the DNA copy number landscape of a cell in S-phase requires conceptually different approaches to that of a cell in G1- or G2/M-phase. Remarkably, despite single-cell whole-genome amplification artifacts, the log2 intensity ratios of single S-phase cells oscillate according to early and late replication domains, which in turn leads to the detection of significantly more DNA imbalances when compared with a cell in G1- or G2/M-phase. Although these DNA imbalances may, on the one hand, be falsely interpreted as genuine structural aberrations in the S-phase cell's copy number profile and hence lead to misdiagnosis, on the other hand, the ability to detect replication domains genome wide in one cell has important applications in DNA-replication research. Genome-wide cell-type-specific early and late replicating domains have been identified by analyses of DNA from populations of cells, but cell-to-cell differences in DNA replication may be important in genome stability, disease aetiology and various other cellular processes.","['Artifacts', 'Base Composition', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'S Phase', 'Single-Cell Analysis']","['Article', 'Article ID', 'Article format', 'Sequence composition report', 'Word composition', 'Protein sequence composition', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Comparative genomics', 'Protein modelling', 'Genome comparison', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'Genetic variation', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Phasing', 'Translation phase specification', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis']"
171,23297839,"Gene expression profiles of the biological control strain Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 inhabiting pea seed surfaces were revealed using a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray. We identified genes expressed by Pf-5 under the control of two global regulators (GacA and RpoS) known to influence biological control and secondary metabolism. Transcript levels of 897 genes, including many with unknown functions as well as those for biofilm formation, cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) signalling, iron homeostasis and secondary metabolism, were influenced by one or both regulators, providing evidence for expression of these genes by Pf-5 on seed surfaces. Comparison of the GacA and RpoS transcriptomes defined for Pf-5 grown on seed versus in broth culture overlapped, but most genes were regulated by GacA or RpoS under only one condition, likely due to differing levels of expression in the two conditions. We quantified secondary metabolites produced by Pf-5 and gacA and rpoS mutants on seed and in culture, and found that production profiles corresponded generally with biosynthetic gene expression profiles. Future studies evaluating biological control mechanisms can now focus on genes expressed by Pf-5 on seed surfaces, the habitat where the bacterium interacts with seed-infecting pathogens to suppress seedling diseases.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacterial Secretion Systems', 'Biofilms', 'Electron Transport', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Iron', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peas', 'Pseudomonas', 'Regulon', 'Seeds', 'Sigma Factor', 'Signal Transduction']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'BioJSON (BioXSD)', 'Electron density map', 'Electron microscopy', 'Transposon prediction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Peptide mass fingerprint', 'Pearson format', 'Peak calling', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Locus ID (PseudoCAP)', 'Sequence feature ID (SwissRegulon)', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

173,23345421,"In many organs, myofibroblasts play a major role in the scarring process in response to injury. In liver fibrogenesis, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are thought to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, but the origins of both HSCs and myofibroblasts remain elusive. In the developing liver, lung, and intestine, mesothelial cells (MCs) differentiate into specific mesenchymal cell types; however, the contribution of this differentiation to organ injury is unknown. In the present study, using mouse models, conditional cell lineage analysis has demonstrated that MCs expressing Wilms tumor 1 give rise to HSCs and myofibroblasts during liver fibrogenesis. Primary MCs, isolated from adult mouse liver using antibodies against glycoprotein M6a, undergo myofibroblastic transdifferentiation. Antagonism of TGF-β signaling suppresses transition of MCs to mesenchymal cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that MCs undergo mesothelial-mesenchymal transition and participate in liver injury via differentiation to HSCs and myofibroblasts.","['Animals', 'Biliary Tract', 'Carbon Tetrachloride', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Epithelium', 'Gene Expression', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mesoderm', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myofibroblasts', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'WT1 Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Abstract', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Cheminformatics', 'Compound name', 'Chemical name (INN)', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence generation', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Keyword', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Proteins', 'Biobank', 'protein', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein domains']"
174,23349713,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are located in the bone marrow in a specific microenvironment referred as the hematopoietic stem cell niche, where HSCs interact with a variety of stromal cells. Though several components of the stem cell niche have been identified, the regulatory mechanisms through which such components regulate the stem cell fate are still unknown. In order to address this issue, we investigated how osteoblasts (OBs) can affect the molecular and functional phenotype of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) and vice versa. For this purpose, human CD34+ cells were cultured in direct contact with primary human OBs. Our data showed that CD34+ cells cultured with OBs give rise to higher total cell numbers, produce more CFUs and maintain a higher percentage of CD34+CD38- cells compared to control culture. Moreover, clonogenic assay and long-term culture results showed that co-culture with OBs induces a strong increase in mono/macrophage precursors coupled to a decrease in the erythroid ones. Finally, gene expression profiling (GEP) allowed us to study which signalling pathways were activated in the hematopoietic cell fraction and in the stromal cell compartment after coculture. Such analysis allowed us to identify several cytokine-receptor networks, such as WNT pathway, and transcription factors, as TWIST1 and FOXC1, that could be activated by co-culture with OBs and could be responsible for the biological effects reported above. Altogether our results indicate that OBs are able to affect HPSCs on 2 different levels: on one side, they increase the immature progenitor pool in vitro, on the other side, they favor the expansion of the mono/macrophage precursors at the expense of the erythroid lineage.","['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Erythroid Cells', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Monocytes', 'Osteoblasts']","['Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Cell culture collection', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular docking', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format']"

Here, we identified Braveheart (Bvht), a heart-associated lncRNA in mouse. Using multiple embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation strategies, we show that Bvht is required for progression of nascent mesoderm toward a cardiac fate. We find that Bvht is necessary for activation of a core cardiovascular gene network and functions upstream of mesoderm posterior 1 (MesP1), a master regulator of a common multipotent cardiovascular progenitor. We also show that Bvht interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), during cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that Bvht mediates epigenetic regulation of cardiac commitment. Finally, we demonstrate a role for Bvht in maintaining cardiac fate in neonatal cardiomyocytes.

176,23359139,"Epithelial tissues have sparse stroma, in contrast to their corresponding tumours. The effect of cancer cells on stromal cells is well recognized. Increasingly, stromal components, such as endothelial and immune cells, are considered indispensable for cancer progression. The role of desmoplastic stroma, in contrast, is poorly understood. Targeting such cellular components within the tumour is attractive. Recent evidence strongly points towards a dynamic stromal cell participation in cancer progression that impacts patient prognosis. The role of specific desmoplastic stromal cells, such as stellate cells and myofibroblasts in pancreatic, oesophageal and skin cancers, was studied in bio-engineered, physiomimetic organotypic cultures and by regression analysis. For pancreatic cancer, the maximal effect on increasing cancer cell proliferation and invasion, as well as decreasing cancer cell apoptosis, occurs when stromal (pancreatic stellate cells) cells constitute the majority of the cellular population (maximal effect at a stromal cell proportion of 0.66-0.83), accompanied by change in expression of key molecules such as E-cadherin and β-catenin. Gene-expression microarrays, across three tumour types, indicate that stromal cells consistently and significantly alter global cancer cell functions such as cell cycle, cell-cell signalling, cell movement, cell death and inflammatory response. However, these changes are mediated through cancer type-specific alteration of expression, with very few common targets across tumour types. As highlighted by these in vitro data, the reciprocal relationship of E-cadherin and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression in cancer cells could be shown, in vivo, to be dependent on the stromal content of human pancreatic cancer. These studies demonstrate that context-specific cancer-stroma crosstalk requires to be precisely defined for effective therapeutic targeting.

The application of adaptive evolution for strains development could be further improved by elucidating the molecular mechanisms. In this study, adaptively evolved yeast mutants with improved galactose utilization ability showed impaired glucose utilization. The molecular genetic basis of this trade-off was investigated using a systems biology approach. Transcriptional and metabolic changes resulting from the improvement of galactose utilization were found maintained during growth on glucose. Moreover, glucose repression related genes showed conserved expression patterns during growth on both sugars. Mutations in the RAS2 gene that were identified as beneficial for galactose utilization in evolved mutants exhibited significant correlation with attenuation of glucose utilization. These results indicate that antagonistic pleiotropy is the dominant mechanism in the observed trade-off, and it is likely realized by changes in glucose signaling.","['Carbon', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Galactose', 'Glucose', 'Mutation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology']","['Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular evolution', 'Deisotoping', 'gxformat2', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Systems biology', 'Biology', 'Biological system modelling']"
178,23408854,"DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) are currently used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. We use the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model to address this question and determine that <2% of regions demethylated by 5-Aza-CdR treatment assume an open configuration. Consolidating our findings, we detect nucleosome retention at sites of global DNA methylation loss in DKO1, an HCT116-derived non-tumorigenic cell-line engineered for DNA methyltransferase disruption. Notably, regions that are open in both HCT116 cells after treatment and in DKO1 cells include promoters belonging to tumor suppressors and genes under-expressed in colorectal cancers. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin opening induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has strikingly distinct targets compared with those of 5-Aza-CdR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the importance of combinatorial therapy in eliciting maximal de-repression of the cancer epigenome.","['Azacitidine', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Vorinostat']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Citation', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Nucleic acids', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters']"

We investigated PBMC microRNA expression in three independent cohorts [healthy, benign pancreatic/peripancreatic diseases (BPD), and pancreatic cancer], comprising a total of 352 participants. First, we used sequencing technology to identify differentially expressed microRNAs in PBMC of pancreatic cancer, BPD, and healthy controls (n = 20 in each group). Then the selected microRNAs were analyzed using the quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays in the remaining 292 samples. The predictive value of the microRNAs was evaluated by logistic regression models and the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We found that miR-27a-3p level in PBMCs could discriminate pancreatic cancer from BPD with a sensitivity of 82.2% and specificity of 76.7% (AUC = 0.840; 95% CI, 0.787-0.885%). Combination of PBMC miR-27a-3p and serum CA19-9 levels provided a higher diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity of 85.3% and specificity of 81.6% (AUC = 0.886; 95% CI, 0.837-0.923%). The satisfactory diagnostic performance of the panel persisted regardless of disease status (AUCs for tumor-node-metastasis stages I-III were 0.881, 0.884, and 0.893, respectively).

180,23447133,"Agonists of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) have potent insulin-sensitizing effects and inhibit atherosclerosis progression in patients with Type II diabetes. Conversely, missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ that render the transcription factor dominant negative (DN) cause early-onset hypertension and Type II diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that DN PPARγ-mediated interference of endogenous wild-type PPARγ in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle exacerbates atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Endothelium-specific expression of DN PPARγ on the ApoE(-/-) background unmasked significant impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic rings, increased systolic blood pressure, altered expression of atherogenic markers (e.g., Cd36, Mcp1, Catalase), and enhanced diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion formation in aorta. Smooth muscle-specific expression of DN PPARγ, which induces aortic dysfunction and increased systolic blood pressure at baseline, also resulted in enhanced diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion formation in aorta on the ApoE(-/-) background that was associated with altered expression of a shared, yet distinct, set of atherogenic markers (e.g., Cd36, Mcp1, Osteopontin, Vcam1). In particular, induction of Osteopontin expression by smooth muscle-specific DN PPARγ correlated with increased plaque calcification.

We analyzed microRNA expression profiles in rat remnant kidneys with or without treatment with L-mimosine. The expression of miR-29c was downregulated in rat remnant kidneys compared with sham control and significantly restored by the L-mimosine treatment. In cultured human kidney epithelial HK2 cells, cobalt chloride activated HIF-α and upregulated miR-29c expression. The upregulation of miR-29c expression was significantly attenuated by knockdown of HIF-1α or HIF-2α.

183,23530188,"Tissue-specific DNA methylation is found at promoters, enhancers, and CpG islands but also over larger genomic regions. In most human tissues, the vast majority of the genome is highly methylated (>70%). Recently, sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA (MethylC-seq) has revealed large partially methylated domains (PMDs) in some human cell lines. PMDs cover up to 40% of the genome and are associated with gene repression and inactive chromatin marks. However, to date, only cultured cells and cancers have shown evidence for PMDs. Here, we performed MethylC-seq in full-term human placenta and demonstrate it is the first known normal tissue showing clear evidence of PMDs. We found that PMDs cover 37% of the placental genome, are stable throughout gestation and between individuals, and can be observed with lower sensitivity in Illumina 450K Infinium data. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that genes in PMDs are repressed in placenta. Using a hidden Markov model to map placental PMDs genome-wide and compare them to PMDs in other cell lines, we found that genes within placental PMDs have tissue-specific functions. For regulatory regions, methylation levels in promoter CpG islands are actually higher for genes within placental PMDs, despite the lower overall methylation of surrounding regions. Similar to PMDs, polycomb-regulated regions are hypomethylated but smaller and distinct from PMDs, with some being hypermethylated in placenta compared with other tissues. These results suggest that PMDs are a developmentally dynamic feature of the methylome that are relevant for understanding both normal development and cancer and may be of use as epigenetic biomarkers.","['Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatin', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sulfites']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Read mapping', 'Molecular replacement', 'Plant biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Bisulfite mapping', 'Protein sites and features', 'Disulfide bond prediction']"

Through high-resolution genomic analysis, we show that WUSCHEL represses a large number of genes that are expressed in differentiating cells including a group of differentiation promoting TFs involved in leaf development. We show that WUS directly binds to the regulatory regions of differentiation promoting TFs; KANADI1, KANADI2, ASYMMETRICLEAVES2 and YABBY3 to repress their expression.

As we show here, comprehensive protein set analyses offer new opportunities to decipher functional molecular networks of diseases and assess the efficacy and side-effects of treatments in vivo. Using mass spectrometry, we quantitatively detected several thousands of proteins and observed significant changes in protein pathways that were (dys-) regulated in diet-induced obesity mice. Analysis of the expression and post-translational modifications of proteins in various peripheral metabolic target tissues including adipose, heart, and liver tissue generated functional insights in the regulation of cell and tissue homeostasis during high-fat diet feeding and medication with two antidiabetic compounds.

187,23580730,"Transcript leaders (TLs) can have profound effects on mRNA translation and stability. To map TL boundaries genome-wide, we developed TL-sequencing (TL-seq), a technique combining enzymatic capture of m(7)G-capped mRNA 5' ends with high-throughput sequencing. TL-seq identified mRNA start sites for the majority of yeast genes and revealed many examples of intragenic TL heterogeneity. Surprisingly, TL-seq identified transcription initiation sites within 6% of protein-coding regions, and these sites were concentrated near the 5' ends of ORFs. Furthermore, ribosome density analysis showed these truncated mRNAs are translated. Translation-associated TL-seq (TATL-seq), which combines TL-seq with polysome fractionation, enabled annotation of TLs, and simultaneously assayed their function in translation. Using TATL-seq to address relationships between TL features and translation of the downstream ORF, we observed that upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and no other upstream codons, were associated with poor translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). We also identified hundreds of genes with very short TLs, and demonstrated that short TLs were associated with poor translation initiation at the annotated start codon and increased initiation at downstream AUGs. This frequently resulted in out-of-frame translation and subsequent termination at premature termination codons, culminating in NMD of the transcript. Unlike previous approaches, our technique enabled observation of alternative TL variants for hundreds of genes and revealed significant differences in translation in genes with distinct TL isoforms. TL-seq and TATL-seq are useful tools for annotation and functional characterization of TLs, and can be applied to any eukaryotic system to investigate TL-mediated regulation of gene expression.","['Codon, Initiator', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polyribosomes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA Caps', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription Initiation, Genetic', 'Yeasts']","['Codon name', 'Codon number', 'Codon usage', 'Threading', 'Protein threading', 'Open science', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Chromosomes', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Yeast', 'BEAST']"

After 28 days in ALI, the epithelial cells differentially expressed basal, ciliated, and goblet cell markers. Using Affymetrix microarrays, 20 human miRNAs were found to be up-regulated, whereas 35 miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated cells. An analysis of changes in global mRNA expression revealed that 1,201 probe sets demonstrated an 8-fold change (FC) or greater at Day 28 of ALI culture. Of these, 816 were up-regulated and 385 were down-regulated. With differentiation, miR-449a increased (FC, 38.15), and was related to changes in mRNA for cell division cycle 25 homolog A (FC, 0.11). MiR-455 decreased (FC, 0.12) and was related to changes in mRNA for the epithelial cell marker, mucin 1 (FC, 136). Transfection with anti-miR-449 or miR-455-3p resulted in changes in target protein expression (cell division cycle 25 homolog A and mucin 1, respectively), whereas transfection with reporter genes with 3'-untranslated regions of these targets confirmed control of expression through that structure.

Phenotypic analysis of Hmgn1(tm1/tm1), Hmgn3(tm1/tm1), and Hmgn5(tm1/tm1) mice and their wild type littermates with a battery of standardized tests uncovered variant-specific abnormalities. Gene expression analysis of four different tissues in each of the Hmgn(tm1/tm1) lines reveals very little overlap between genes affected by specific variants in different tissues. Pathway analysis reveals that loss of an HMGN variant subtly affects expression of numerous genes in specific biological processes.

192,23644663,"CD99, a transmembrane protein encoded by MIC2 gene is involved in multiple cellular events including cell adhesion and migration, apoptosis, cell differentiation and regulation of protein trafficking either in physiological or pathological conditions. In osteosarcoma, CD99 is expressed at low levels and functions as a tumour suppressor. The full-length protein (CD99wt) and the short-form harbouring a deletion in the intracytoplasmic domain (CD99sh) have been associated with distinct functional outcomes with respect to tumour malignancy. In this study, we especially evaluated modulation of cell-cell contacts, reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and modulation of signalling pathways by comparing osteosarcoma cells characterised by different metastasis capabilities and CD99 expression, to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for metastasis. Our data indicate that forced expression of CD99wt induces recruitment of N-cadherin and β-catenin to adherens junctions. In addition, transfection of CD99wt inhibits the expression of several molecules crucial to the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ACTR2, ARPC1A, Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) as well as ezrin, an ezrin/radixin/moesin family member that has been clearly associated with tumour progression and metastatic spread in osteosarcoma. Functional studies point to ROCK2 as a crucial intracellular mediator regulating osteosarcoma migration. By maintaining c-Src in an inactive conformation, CD99wt inhibits ROCK2 signalling and this leads to ezrin decrease at cell membrane while N-cadherin and β-catenin translocate to the plasma membrane and function as main molecular bridges for actin cytoskeleton. Taken together, we propose that the re-expression of CD99wt, which is generally present in osteoblasts but lost in osteosarcoma, through inhibition of c-Src and ROCK2 activity, manages to increase contact strength and reactivate stop-migration signals that counteract the otherwise dominant promigratory action of ezrin in osteosarcoma cells.","['12E7 Antigen', 'Actin Cytoskeleton', 'Antigens, CD', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteosarcoma', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'rho-Associated Kinases']","['Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'GEN', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'CD spectra', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Proteins', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Cell line name', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell biology', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Laboratory techniques', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'DNA translation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Kinase name']"
193,23696748,"B lymphopoiesis is the result of several cell-commitment, lineage-choice, and differentiation processes. Every differentiation step is characterized by the activation of a new, lineage-specific, genetic program and the extinction of the previous one. To date, the central role of specific transcription factors in positively regulating these distinct differentiation processes to acquire a B cell-specific genetic program is well established. However, the existence of specific transcriptional repressors responsible for the silencing of lineage inappropriate genes remains elusive. Here we addressed the molecular mechanism behind repression of non-lymphoid genes in B cells. We report that the histone deacetylase HDAC7 was highly expressed in pre-B cells but dramatically down-regulated during cellular lineage conversion to macrophages. Microarray analysis demonstrated that HDAC7 re-expression interfered with the acquisition of the gene transcriptional program characteristic of macrophages during cell transdifferentiation; the presence of HDAC7 blocked the induction of key genes for macrophage function, such as immune, inflammatory, and defense response, cellular response to infections, positive regulation of cytokines production, and phagocytosis. Moreover, re-introduction of HDAC7 suppressed crucial functions of macrophages, such as the ability to phagocytose bacteria and to respond to endotoxin by expressing major pro-inflammatory cytokines. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating HDAC7 repression in pre-B cells, we undertook co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation experimental approaches. We found that HDAC7 specifically interacted with the transcription factor MEF2C in pre-B cells and was recruited to MEF2 binding sites located at the promoters of genes critical for macrophage function. Thus, in B cells HDAC7 is a transcriptional repressor of undesirable genes. Our findings uncover a novel role for HDAC7 in maintaining the identity of a particular cell type by silencing lineage-inappropriate genes.","['B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Humans', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'MADS Domain Proteins', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Macrophages', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']","['Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map']"
194,23706738,"Maintaining proper mRNA levels is a key aspect in the regulation of gene expression. The balance between mRNA synthesis and decay determines these levels. We demonstrate that most yeast mRNAs are degraded by the cytoplasmic 5'-to-3' pathway (the ""decaysome""), as proposed previously. Unexpectedly, the level of these mRNAs is highly robust to perturbations in this major pathway because defects in various decaysome components lead to transcription downregulation. Moreover, these components shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, in a manner dependent on proper mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, they associate with chromatin-preferentially ∼30 bp upstream of transcription start-sites-and directly stimulate transcription initiation and elongation. The nuclear role of the decaysome in transcription is linked to its cytoplasmic role in mRNA decay; linkage, in turn, seems to depend on proper shuttling of its components.

Simple spermidine feeding not only restored juvenile polyamine levels, but also suppressed age-induced memory impairment. Ornithine decarboxylase-1, the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo polyamine synthesis, also protected olfactory memories in aged flies when expressed specifically in Kenyon cells, which are crucial for olfactory memory formation. Spermidine-fed flies showed enhanced autophagy (a form of cellular self-digestion), and genetic deficits in the autophagic machinery prevented spermidine-mediated rescue of memory impairments. Our findings indicate that autophagy is critical for suppression of memory impairments by spermidine and that polyamines, which are endogenously present, are candidates for pharmacological intervention.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Autophagy', 'Drosophila', 'Memory Disorders', 'Motor Activity', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Polyamines', 'Spermidine']","['Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Author ID', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order', 'CT', 'GPCR coupling selectivity prediction', 'Protein active sites', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'PolyA signal detection', 'PolyA signal or sites']"

203,24402866,"Rings or arcs of fungus-stimulated plant growth occur worldwide; these are commonly referred to as ""fairy rings"". In 2010, we discovered 2-azahypoxanthine (AHX), a compound responsible for the fairy-ring phenomenon caused by fungus; AHX stimulated the growth of all the plants tested. Herein, we reveal the isolation and structure determination of a common metabolite of AHX in plants, 2-aza-8-oxohypoxanthine (AOH). AHX is chemically synthesized from 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA), and AHX can be converted into AOH by xanthine oxidase. AICA is one of the members of the purine metabolic pathway in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, further metabolism of AICA remains elusive. Based on these results and facts, we hypothesized that plants themselves produce AHX and AOH through a pathway similar to the chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the existence of endogenous AHX and AOH and a novel purine pathway to produce them in plants.","['Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Hypoxanthines', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Oryza', 'Purines', 'Xanthine Oxidase']","['X-ray diffraction', 'Protein structure assignment (from X-ray crystallographic data)', 'Tomography', 'Protein interaction format', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'pure', 'pure protein', 'pure rna']"

210,27819675,"Intestinal epithelial stem cells are highly sensitive to differentiation induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Colorectal cancer develops from mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells. The most frequent initiating mutation occurs in Apc, which results in hyperactivated Wnt signalling. This causes hyperproliferation and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy, but whether these mutated stem cells are sensitive to ER stress induced differentiation remains unknown. Here we examined this by generating mice in which both Apc and ER stress repressor chaperone Grp78 can be conditionally deleted from the intestinal epithelium. For molecular studies, we used intestinal organoids derived from these mice. Homozygous loss of Apc alone resulted in crypt elongation, activation of the Wnt signature and accumulation of intestinal epithelial stem cells, as expected. This phenotype was however completely rescued on activation of ER stress by additional deletion of Grp78. In these Apc-Grp78 double mutant animals, stem cells were rapidly lost and repopulation occurred by non-mutant cells that had escaped recombination, suggesting that Apc-Grp78 double mutant stem cells had lost self-renewal capacity. Although in Apc-Grp78 double mutant mice the Wnt signature was lost, these intestines exhibited ubiquitous epithelial presence of nuclear β-catenin. This suggests that ER stress interferes with Wnt signalling downstream of nuclear β-catenin. In conclusion, our findings indicate that ER stress signalling results in loss of Apc mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells by interference with the Wnt signature. In contrast to many known inhibitors of Wnt signalling, ER stress acts downstream of β-catenin. Therefore, ER stress poses a promising target in colorectal cancers, which develop as a result of Wnt activating mutations.","['Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Stem Cells', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin']","['protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence composition', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene transcription', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Transcription', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'cel', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Beta diversity data']"
211,28753614,"Regenerating tissue must initiate the signaling that drives regenerative growth, and sustain that signaling long enough for regeneration to complete. How these key signals are sustained is unclear. To gain a comprehensive view of the changes in gene expression that occur during regeneration, we performed whole-genome mRNAseq of actively regenerating tissue from damaged Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We used genetic tools to ablate the wing primordium to induce regeneration, and carried out transcriptional profiling of the regeneration blastema by fluorescently labeling and sorting the blastema cells, thus identifying differentially expressed genes. Importantly, by using genetic mutants of several of these differentially expressed genes we have confirmed that they have roles in regeneration. Using this approach, we show that high expression of the gene moladietz (mol), which encodes the Duox-maturation factor NIP, is required during regeneration to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn sustain JNK signaling during regeneration. We also show that JNK signaling upregulates mol expression, thereby activating a positive feedback signal that ensures the prolonged JNK activation required for regenerative growth. Thus, by whole-genome transcriptional profiling of regenerating tissue we have identified a positive feedback loop that regulates the extent of regenerative growth.","['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Imaginal Discs', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regeneration', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wings, Animal']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Prosite protein pattern', 'EMBOSS sequence pattern', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell migration track image', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Kinase name', 'MAP', 'Map', 'Operating system name', 'Biological system modelling', 'System metadata', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
212,28756741,"Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) copy number is tightly regulated during pluripotency and differentiation. There is increased demand of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during differentiation for energy-intensive cell types such as hepatocytes and neurons to meet the cell's functional requirements. During hepatocyte differentiation, mtDNA copy number should be synchronously increased to generate sufficient ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Unlike bone marrow mesenchymal cells, mtDNA copy number failed to increase by 28 days of differentiation of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) despite their expression of some end-stage hepatic markers. This was due to higher levels of DNA methylation at exon 2 of POLGA, the mtDNA-specific replication factor. Treatment with a DNA demethylation agent, 5-azacytidine, resulted in increased mtDNA copy number, reduced DNA methylation at exon 2 of POLGA, and reduced hepatic gene expression. Depletion of mtDNA followed by subsequent differentiation did not increase mtDNA copy number, but reduced DNA methylation at exon 2 of POLGA and increased expression of hepatic and pluripotency genes. We encapsulated hAEC in barium alginate microcapsules and subsequently differentiated them into HLC. Encapsulation resulted in no net increase of mtDNA copy number but a significant reduction in DNA methylation of POLGA. RNAseq analysis showed that differentiated HLC express hepatocyte-specific genes but also increased expression of inflammatory interferon genes. Differentiation in encapsulated cells showed suppression of inflammatory genes as well as increased expression of genes associated with hepatocyte function pathways and networks. This study demonstrates that an increase in classical hepatic gene expression can be achieved in HLC through encapsulation, although they fail to effectively regulate mtDNA copy number.","['Amnion', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'Genetic variation', 'Mitochondria', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Gene ID', 'Gene map', 'Gene name', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease']"

To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cell-cycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation.

We demonstrate that following postnatal ablation of granule cell progenitors, Nestin-expressing progenitors, specified during mid-embryogenesis to produce astroglia and interneurons, switch their fate and generate granule neurons in mice. Moreover, Hedgehog signaling in two Nestin-expressing progenitor populations is crucial not only for the compensatory replenishment of granule neurons but also for scaling interneuron and astrocyte numbers. Thus, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying robustness of circuit formation in the cerebellum and speculate that adaptive reprogramming of progenitors in other brain regions plays a greater role than appreciated in developmental regeneration.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes', 'Cerebellum', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins', 'Interneurons', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nestin', 'Neural Stem Cells', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structural data', 'Structure clustering', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'NeuronDB ID']"

Potential predictive biomarkers for pictilisib were evaluated, and RNA sequencing was performed to explore drug resistance mechanisms.<b>Results:</b> The bladder cancer cell line TCCSUP, which harbors a <i>PIK3CA</i> E545K mutation, was sensitive to pictilisib compared to cell lines with wild-type <i>PIK3CA</i> Pictilisib exhibited stronger antitumor activity in bladder cancer PDX models with <i>PI3KCA</i> H1047R mutation or amplification than the control PDX model. Pictilisib synergized with cisplatin and/or gemcitabine <i>in vitro</i>, significantly delayed tumor growth, and prolonged survival compared with single-drug treatment in the PDX models. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 correlated with response to pictilisib both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and could potentially serve as a biomarker to predict response to pictilisib. Pictilisib activated the compensatory MEK/ERK pathway that likely contributed to pictilisib resistance, which was reversed by cotreatment with the RAF inhibitor sorafenib.

During inflammatory stimulation, ILCregs can be induced in the intestine and suppress the activation of ILC1s and ILC3s via secretion of IL-10, leading to protection against innate intestinal inflammation. Moreover, TGF-β1 is induced by ILCregs during the innate intestinal inflammation, and autocrine TGF-β1 sustains the maintenance and expansion of ILCregs.

Changing expression of these transcription factors as the disease progresses has been linked to the metastatic mechanism of phenotype switching. We therefore investigated the effects of MITF and BRN2 expression in melanoma growth and metastasis. Depletion of MITF resulted in a cell population that had a slowed cell cycle progression, was less invasive in vitro and had hindered tumor and metastasis forming ability in mouse xenograft studies. BRN2 depletion left a cell population with intact proliferation and invasion in vitro; however metastatic growth was significantly reduced in the mouse xenograft model.

This study shows that modular synergism between miRNAs and neuronal subtype-specific transcription factors can drive lineage-specific neuronal reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of distinct subtypes of human neurons.","['Adult', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Methylation', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterochromatin', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons', 'Spinal Cord', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Report', 'Data', 'Sequence record', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
221,28891811,"Macrophages are attracted to developing tumors and can participate in immune surveillance to eliminate neoplastic cells. In response, neoplastic cells utilize NF-κB to suppress this killing activity, but the mechanisms underlying their self-protection remain unclear. Here, we report that this dynamic interaction between tumor cells and macrophages is integrally linked by a soluble factor identified as growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). In vitro, tumor-derived GDF-15 signals in macrophages to suppress their proapoptotic activity by inhibiting TNF and nitric oxide (NO) production. In vivo, depletion of GDF-15 in Ras-driven tumor xenografts and in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer delayed tumor development. This delay correlated with increased infiltrating antitumor macrophages. Further, production of GDF-15 is directly regulated by NF-κB, and the colocalization of activated NF-κB and GDF-15 in epithelial ducts of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma supports the importance of this observation. Mechanistically, we found that GDF-15 suppresses macrophage activity by inhibiting TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1) signaling to NF-κB, thereby blocking synthesis of TNF and NO. Based on these results, we propose that the NF-κB/GDF-15 regulatory axis is important for tumor cells in evading macrophage immune surveillance during the early stages of tumorigenesis.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15', 'Heterografts', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Heterogen annotation', 'R script', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Kinase name', 'Kinetic model', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'SAGE experimental data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Tumor annotation']"
222,28928458,"The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in triple-negative breast cancers is correlated with improved outcomes. Ras/MAPK pathway activation is associated with significantly lower levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in triple-negative breast cancers and while MEK inhibition can promote recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to the tumor, here we show that MEK inhibition adversely affects early onset T-cell effector function. We show that α-4-1BB and α-OX-40 T-cell agonist antibodies can rescue the adverse effects of MEK inhibition on T cells in both mouse and human T cells, which results in augmented anti-tumor effects in vivo. This effect is dependent upon increased downstream p38/JNK pathway activation. Taken together, our data suggest that although Ras/MAPK pathway inhibition can increase tumor immunogenicity, the negative impact on T-cell activity is functionally important. This undesirable impact is effectively prevented by combination with T-cell immune agonist immunotherapies resulting in superior therapeutic efficacy.MEK inhibition in breast cancer is associated with increased tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), however, MAPK activity is required for T cells function.

To understand how a tailored response is coordinated, we examined the inflammatory response elicited in mouse macrophages by ionizing radiation (IR). RNA-sequencing studies revealed that most radiation-induced genes were strongly dependent on only one of a small number of sensors and signaling pathways, notably the DNA damage-induced kinase ATM, which regulated many IR-response genes, including interferon response genes, via an atypical IRF1-dependent, STING-independent mechanism. Moreover, small, defined sets of genes activated by p53 and NRF2 accounted for the selective response to radiation in comparison to a microbial inducer of inflammation. Our findings reveal that genes comprising an environmental response are activated by defined sensing mechanisms with a high degree of selectivity, and they identify distinct components of the radiation response that might be susceptible to therapeutic perturbation.","['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferons', 'Macrophages', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']","['Protein report', 'Proteins', 'Protein report format', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mutation ID', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'protein', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence signature map', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Transcription factor name', 'Image metadata', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'RH scores', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription regulatory sequence analysis', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Tumor annotation', 'Protein expression', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases']"

Yet how Id2 expression is regulated in each ILC subset remains poorly understood. We identified a cis-regulatory element demarcated by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that controls the function and lineage identity of group 1 ILCs, while being dispensable for early ILC development and homeostasis of ILC2s and ILC3s. The locus encoding this lncRNA, which we termed Rroid, directly interacted with the promoter of its neighboring gene, Id2, in group 1 ILCs. Moreover, the Rroid locus, but not the lncRNA itself, controlled the identity and function of ILC1s by promoting chromatin accessibility and deposition of STAT5 at the promoter of Id2 in response to interleukin (IL)-15. Thus, non-coding elements responsive to extracellular cues unique to each ILC subset represent a key regulatory layer for controlling the identity and function of ILCs.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Loci', 'Homeostasis', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'Epistasis', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'protein', 'Natural product identification', 'Natural language processing', 'NLP format', 'Feature selection', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

226,29127378,"Salmonella possesses virulence determinants that allow replication under extreme conditions and invasion of host cells, causing disease. Here, we examined four putative genes predicted to encode membrane proteins (ydiY, ybdJ, STM1441 and ynaJ) and a putative transcriptional factor (yedF). These genes were identified in a previous study of a S. Typhimurium clinical isolate and its multidrug-resistant counterpart. For STM1441 and yedF a reduced ability to interact with HeLa cells was observed in the knock-out mutants, but an increase in this ability was absent when these genes were overexpressed, except for yedF which phenotype was rescued when yedF was restored. In the absence of yedF, decreased expression was seen for: i) virulence-related genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, attachment and survival inside the host cell; ii) global regulators of the invasion process (hilA, hilC and hilD); and iii) factors involved in LPS biosynthesis. In contrast, an increased expression was observed for anaerobic metabolism genes. We propose yedF is involved in the regulation of Salmonella pathogenesis and contributes to the activation of the virulence machinery. Moreover, we propose that, when oxygen is available, yedF contributes sustained repression of the anaerobic pathway. Therefore, we recommend this gene be named vrf, for virulence-related factor.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Transcription Factors', 'Virulence Factors']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Sequence alignment', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites']"
227,29246928,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved ∼22 nt small noncoding RNAs that bind partially complementary sequences in target transcripts. MicroRNAs regulate both translation and transcript stability, and play important roles in development, cellular homeostasis, and disease. There are limited approaches available to agnostically identify microRNA targets transcriptome-wide, and methods using miRNA mimics, which in principle identify direct miRNA:transcript pairs, have low sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a novel method to identify microRNA targets using miR-29b mimics containing 3-cyanovinylcarbazole (<sup>CNV</sup>K), a photolabile nucleoside analog. We demonstrate that biotin-tagged, <sup>CNV</sup>K-containing miR-29b (<sup>CNV</sup>K-miR-29b) mimics are nontoxic in cell culture, associate with endogenous mammalian Argonaute2, are sensitive for known targets and recapitulate endogenous transcript destabilization. Partnering <sup>CNV</sup>K-miR-29b with ultra-low-input RNA sequencing, we recover ∼40% of known miR-29b targets and find conservation of the focal adhesion and apoptotic target pathways in mouse and human. We also identify hundreds of novel targets, including <i>NRAS</i>, <i>HOXA10</i>, and <i>KLF11</i>, with a validation rate of 71% for a subset of 73 novel target transcripts interrogated using a high-throughput luciferase assay. Consistent with previous reports, we show that both endogenous miR-29b and <sup>CNV</sup>K-miR-29b are trafficked to the nucleus, but find no evidence of nuclear-specific miR-29b transcript binding. This may indicate that miR-29b nuclear sequestration is a regulatory mechanism in itself.

We analyzed HPV-induced epithelial hyperplasia and squamous cell carcinoma formation, as well as growth of tumors inoculated into the dermis, in mice lacking skin mast cells. Unexpectedly, the absence of mast cells had no effect on HPV-induced epithelial growth or angiogenesis, on growth kinetics of inoculated tumors, or on the immunological tumor micro-milieu.

229,29314052,"The circadian clock enables organisms to rapidly adapt to the ever-changing environmental conditions that are caused by daily light/dark cycles. Circadian clock genes universally affect key agricultural traits, particularly flowering time. Here, we show that OsPRR37, a circadian clock gene, delays rice flowering time in an expression level-dependent manner. Using high-throughput mRNA sequencing on an OsPRR37 overexpressing transgenic line (OsPRR37-OE5) and the recipient parent Guangluai4 that contains the loss-of-function Osprr37, we identify 14,992 genes that display diurnal rhythms, which account for 52.9% of the transcriptome. Overexpressing OsPRR37 weakens the transcriptomic rhythms and alters the phases of rhythmic genes. In total, 3,210 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified, among which 1,863 rhythmic DEGs show a correlation between the change of absolute amplitudes and the mean expression levels. We further reveal that OsPRR37 functions as a transcriptional repressor to repress the expression levels and amplitudes of day-phased clock genes. More importantly, OsPRR37 confers expanded regulation on the evening-phased rhythmic DEGs by repressing the morning-phased rhythmic DEGs. Further study shows that OsPRR37 expands its regulation on flowering pathways by repressing Ehd1. Thus, our results demonstrate an expanded regulation mechanism of the circadian clock on the diurnal rhythms of the transcriptome.","['Circadian Clocks', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Flowers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Oryza', 'Photoperiod', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Transcriptome']","['Flow cell identifier', 'Power test', 'Primers', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Genetic engineering', 'Plant biology', 'Genetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
230,29352292,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). It is endemic in a number of sub-Saharan African countries with infection rate of >50%. The high prevalence of HIV-1 coupled with late presentation of advanced cancer staging make KS the leading cancer in the region with poor prognosis and high mortality. Disease markers and cellular functions associated with KS tumorigenesis remain ill-defined. Several studies have attempted to investigate changes of the gene profile with in vitro infection of monoculture models, which are not likely to reflect the cellular complexity of the in vivo lesion environment. Our approach is to characterize and compare the gene expression profile in KS lesions versus non-cancer tissues from the same individual. Such comparisons could identify pathways critical for KS formation and maintenance. This is the first study that utilized high throughput RNA-seq to characterize the viral and cellular transcriptome in tumor and non-cancer biopsies of African epidemic KS patients. These patients were treated anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable HIV-1 plasma viral load. We found remarkable variability in the viral transcriptome among these patients, with viral latency and immune modulation genes most abundantly expressed. The presence of KSHV also significantly affected the cellular transcriptome profile. Specifically, genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism disorder pathways were substantially affected. Moreover, infiltration of immune cells into the tumor did not prevent KS formation, suggesting some functional deficits of these cells. Lastly, we found only minimal overlaps between our in vivo cellular transcriptome dataset with those from in vitro studies, reflecting the limitation of in vitro models in representing tumor lesions.

The differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into MSCs offers a renewable source of MSCs; however, reports on their immunomodulatory capacity have been discrepant. Using MSCs differentiated from iPSCs reprogrammed using diverse cell types and protocols, and in comparison to human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-MSCs and bone marrow (BM)-MSCs, we performed transcriptome analyses and assessed for functional immunomodulatory properties. Differentiation of MSCs from iPSCs results in decreased c-Myc expression and its downstream pathway along with a concomitant downregulation in the DNA replication pathway. All four lines of iPSC-MSCs can significantly suppress in vitro activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation to a similar degree as ESC-MSCs and BM-MSCs, and modulate CD4 T lymphocyte fate from a type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and IL-17A-expressing (Th17) cell fate to a regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype. Moreover, iPSC-MSCs significantly suppress cytotoxic CD8 T proliferation, activation, and differentiation into type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) and IL-17-expressing CD8 T (Tc17) cells. Coculture of activated PBMCs with human iPSC-MSCs results in an overall shift of secreted cytokine profile from a pro-inflammatory environment to a more immunotolerant milieu. iPSC-MSC immunomodulation was also validated in vivo in a mouse model of induced inflammation.

Using RNA-seq transcriptome analysis, we found 38 common genes that significantly express in different types of breast cancer cells under shikonin treatment. In particular, our results indicated that shikonin induces the expression of dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP)-1 and DUSP2 in both RNA and protein levels. In addition, shikonin also inhibits the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, the downstream signaling molecules of DUSP1 and DUSP2.

In particular, changes in expression occur mainly in active or potentially active chromatin, both inside and outside LaminB-associated domains (LADs). Furthermore, we identified a somatic target of AGO2 transcriptional repression, no hitter (nht), which is immersed in a LAD located within a repressive topologically-associated domain (TAD). Null mutation but not catalytic inactivation of AGO2 leads to ectopic expression of nht and downstream spermatogenesis genes. Depletion of either AGO2 or LaminB results in reduced looping interactions within the nht TAD as well as ectopic inter-TAD interactions, as detected by 4C-seq analysis.

236,29530878,"A conserved feature of the central nervous system (CNS) is the prominent expansion of anterior regions (brain) compared with posterior (nerve cord). The cellular and regulatory processes driving anterior CNS expansion are not well understood in any bilaterian species. Here, we address this expansion in <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse. We find that, compared with the nerve cord, the brain displays extended progenitor proliferation, more elaborate daughter cell proliferation and more rapid cell cycle speed in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse. These features contribute to anterior CNS expansion in both species. With respect to genetic control, enhanced brain proliferation is severely reduced by ectopic Hox gene expression, by either Hox misexpression or by loss of Polycomb group (PcG) function. Strikingly, in PcG mutants, early CNS proliferation appears to be unaffected, whereas subsequent brain proliferation is severely reduced. Hence, a conserved PcG-Hox program promotes the anterior expansion of the CNS. The profound differences in proliferation and in the underlying genetic mechanisms between brain and nerve cord lend support to the emerging concept of separate evolutionary origins of these two CNS regions.","['Animals', 'Asymmetric Cell Division', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Central Nervous System', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Neurogenesis', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'RNA central ID', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'HET group name']"

Although reactivation from latency causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, our molecular understanding of latency is limited. Here, we delineate viral gene expression during natural HCMV persistent infection by analyzing the massive transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) atlas generated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. This systematic analysis reveals that HCMV persistence <i>in vivo</i> is prevalent in diverse tissues. Notably, we find only viral transcripts that resemble gene expression during various stages of lytic infection with no evidence of any highly restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. To further define the transcriptional landscape during HCMV latent infection, we also used single-cell RNA-seq and a tractable experimental latency model. In contrast to some current views on latency, we also find no evidence for any highly restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. Instead, we reveal that latency-associated gene expression largely mirrors a late lytic viral program, albeit at much lower levels of expression. Overall, our work has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of HCMV persistence and suggests that latency is governed mainly by quantitative changes, with a limited number of qualitative changes, in viral gene expression.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Human cytomegalovirus is a prevalent pathogen, infecting most of the population worldwide and establishing lifelong latency in its hosts. Although reactivation from latency causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts, our molecular understanding of the latent state remains limited. Here, we examine the viral gene expression during natural and experimental latent HCMV infection on a transcriptome-wide level. In contrast to the classical views on herpesvirus latency, we find no evidence for a restricted latency-associated viral gene expression program. Instead, we reveal that latency gene expression largely resembles a late lytic viral profile, albeit at much lower levels of expression. Taken together, our data transform the current view of HCMV persistence and suggest that latency is mainly governed by quantitative rather than qualitative changes in viral gene expression.","['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Virus Latency']","['Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Cytometry', 'Virus identifier', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA sequence', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Virus annotation']"
238,29554310,"Initially identified as a factor involved in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, Grb10-interacting GYF protein 2 (GIGYF2) has later been shown to interact with the 5' cap-binding protein 4EHP as part of a translation repression complex, and to mediate post-transcriptional repression of tethered reporter mRNAs. A current model proposes that GIGYF2 is indirectly recruited to mRNAs by specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) leading to translation repression through its association with 4EHP. Accordingly, we recently observed that GIGYF2 also interacts with the miRNA-induced silencing complex and probably modulates its translation repression activity. Here we have further investigated how GIGYF2 represses mRNA function. In a tethering reporter assay, we identify three independent domains of GIGYF2 with repressive activity. In this assay, GIGYF2-mediated repression is independent of 4EHP but largely dependent on the CCR4/NOT complex that GIGYF2 recruits through multiple interfaces. Importantly, we show that GIGYF2 is an RBP and identify for the first time endogenous mRNA targets that recapitulate 4EHP-independent repression. Altogether, we propose that GIGYF2 has two distinct mechanisms of repression: one depends on 4EHP binding and mainly affects translation; the other is 4EHP-independent and involves the CCR4/NOT complex and its deadenylation activity.","['Carrier Proteins', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA Cap-Binding Proteins', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Ribonucleases']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Rare diseases']"

A majority of these drugs elicited reproducible signatures, but notable cell line- and assay-specific differences were observed. Using the ""connectivity"" framework, we compared signatures across cell types and integrated data across assays, including a transcriptional assay (L1000). Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended lineage, and consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs.

We mapped regions of hyper-accessible chromatin in naive cells during TCR stimulation and discovered that the transcription factor (TF) Runx3 promoted accessibility to memory CTL-specific cis-regulatory regions before the first cell division and was essential for memory CTL differentiation. Runx3 was specifically required for accessibility to regions highly enriched with IRF, bZIP and Prdm1-like TF motifs, upregulation of TFs Irf4 and Blimp1, and activation of fundamental CTL attributes in early effector and memory precursor cells. Runx3 ensured that nascent CTLs differentiated into memory CTLs by preventing high expression of the TF T-bet, slowing effector cell proliferation, and repressing terminal CTL differentiation. Runx3 overexpression enhanced memory CTL differentiation during iterative infections. Thus, Runx3 governs chromatin accessibility during TCR stimulation and enforces the memory CTL developmental program.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatin', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic', 'Vero Cells']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Bit score', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regulatory affairs', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Cytogenetics', 'cel']"
241,29704667,"The lung is the entry site for Bacillus anthracis in inhalation anthrax, the most deadly form of the disease. Spores must escape through the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier and migrate to regional lymph nodes, germinate and enter the circulatory system to cause disease. Several mechanisms to explain alveolar escape have been postulated, and all these tacitly involve the AEC barrier. In this study, we incorporate our primary human type I AEC model, microarray and gene enrichment analysis, qRT-PCR, multiplex ELISA, and neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis assays to study the response of AEC to B. anthracis, (Sterne) spores at 4 and 24 h post-exposure. Spore exposure altered gene expression in AEC after 4 and 24 h and differentially expressed genes (±1.3 fold, p ≤ 0.05) included CCL4/MIP-1β (4 h), CXCL8/IL-8 (4 and 24 h) and CXCL5/ENA-78 (24 h). Gene enrichment analysis revealed that pathways involving cytokine or chemokine activity, receptor binding, and innate immune responses to infection were prominent. Microarray results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and multiplex ELISA assays. Chemotaxis assays demonstrated that spores induced the release of biologically active neutrophil and monocyte chemokines, and that CXCL8/IL-8 was the major neutrophil chemokine. The small or sub-chemotactic doses of CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL2/GROβ and CCL20/MIP-3α may contribute to chemotaxis by priming effects. These data provide the first whole transcriptomic description of the human type I AEC initial response to B. anthracis spore exposure.

242,29746213,"There is a current interest in the development of biodosimetric methods for rapidly assessing radiation exposure in the wake of a large-scale radiological event. This work was initially focused on determining the exposure dose to an individual using biological indicators. Gene expression signatures show promise for biodosimetric application, but little is known about how these signatures might translate for the assessment of radiological injury in radiosensitive individuals, who comprise a significant proportion of the general population, and who would likely require treatment after exposure to lower doses. Using Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice as a model radiation-sensitive genotype, we have investigated the effect of this DNA repair deficiency on the gene expression response to radiation. Although Parp1 is known to play general roles in regulating transcription, the pattern of gene expression changes observed in Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice 24 h postirradiation to a LD<sub>50/30</sub> was remarkably similar to that in wild-type mice after exposure to LD<sub>50/30</sub>. Similar levels of activation of both the p53 and NFκB radiation response pathways were indicated in both strains. In contrast, exposure of wild-type mice to a sublethal dose that was equal to the Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> LD<sub>50/30</sub> resulted in a lower magnitude gene expression response. Thus, Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a heightened gene expression response to radiation, which was more similar to the wild-type response to an equitoxic dose than to an equal absorbed dose. Gene expression classifiers trained on the wild-type data correctly identified all wild-type samples as unexposed, exposed to a sublethal dose or exposed to an LD<sub>50/30</sub>. All unexposed samples from Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were also correctly classified with the same gene set, and 80% of irradiated Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> samples were identified as exposed to an LD<sub>50/30</sub>. The results of this study suggest that, at least for some pathways that may influence radiosensitivity in humans, specific gene expression signatures have the potential to accurately detect the extent of radiological injury, rather than serving only as a surrogate of physical radiation dose.","['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Mice', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Microarray experiment', 'Microarrays', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'PCR experiment', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'PolyA signal detection']"

Therefore, deciphering molecular mechanisms of metastatic dissemination is a key prerequisite to improve future treatment options. With this aim, we took advantage of different colorectal cancer cell lines and recently established primary cultures enriched in colon cancer stem cells, also known as tumor-initiating cells (TIC), to identify genes and miRNAs with regulatory functions in colorectal cancer progression. We show here that metastasis-derived TICs display increased capacity for self-renewal, TGFβ signaling activity, and reduced expression of the miR-371∼373 cluster compared with nonmetastatic cultures. TGFβ receptor 2 (<i>TGFBR2</i>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (<i>ALDH1A1</i>) were identified as important target genes of the miR-371∼373 cluster. In addition, TGFBR2 repression, either by direct knockdown or indirectly via overexpression of the entire miR-371∼373 cluster, decreased tumor-initiating potential of TICs. We observed significantly reduced <i>in vitro</i> self-renewal activity as well as lowered tumor initiation and metastatic outgrowth capacity <i>in vivo</i> following stable overexpression of the miR-371∼373 cluster in different colon TIC cultures. Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) was affected by both TGFBR2 and miR-371∼373 cluster alterations. Functional sphere and tumor formation as well as metastatic dissemination assays validated the link between miR-371∼373 and ID1.

While multiple discrete adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) subsets are thought to exist, their respective effects on adipose tissue, and the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie the functional differences between ATM subsets, are not well understood. We report that obese fat tissue of mice and humans contain multiple distinct populations of ATMs with unique tissue distributions, transcriptomes, chromatin landscapes, and functions. Mouse Ly6c ATMs reside outside of CLS and are adipogenic, while CD9 ATMs reside within CLS, are lipid-laden, and are proinflammatory. Adoptive transfer of Ly6c ATMs into lean mice activates gene programs typical of normal adipocyte physiology. By contrast, adoptive transfer of CD9 ATMs drives gene expression that is characteristic of obesity. Importantly, human adipose tissue contains similar ATM populations, including lipid-laden CD9 ATMs that increase with body mass. These results provide a higher resolution of the cellular and functional heterogeneity within ATMs and provide a framework within which to develop new immune-directed therapies for the treatment of obesity and related sequela.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Exosomes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Obesity', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Transcriptome']","['Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Exome sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Histogram', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Correspondingly, miRNA gene targets, EZH2 (by hsa-miR-205) and CD44 (by hsa-miR-199a), were both overexpressed in pagetoid SGC. CD44 has been identified as a potential cancer stem cell marker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its overexpression in pagetoid cells represents a novel treatment target.

In this study, we microdissected residual prostate cancer foci in radical prostatectomies from 18 men treated with neoadjuvant-intensive androgen deprivation therapy (leuprolide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone) and analyzed them for resistance mechanisms. Transcriptome profiling showed reduced but persistent androgen receptor (AR) activity in residual tumors, with no increase in neuroendocrine differentiation. Proliferation correlated negatively with AR activity but positively with decreased RB1 expression, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) further showed enrichment for RB1 genomic loss. In 15 cases where 2 or 3 tumor foci were microdissected, WES confirmed a common clonal origin but identified multiple oncogenic alterations unique to each focus. These findings show that subclones with oncogenic alterations found in mCRPC are present in primary prostate cancer and are selected for by neoadjuvant-intense androgen deprivation therapy. In particular, this study indicates that subclonal RB1 loss may be more common than previously appreciated in intermediate- to high-risk primary prostate cancer and may be an early event, independent of neuroendocrine differentiation, in the development of mCRPC.

This assay can help identify fusions in patients with cancer; these patients may in turn benefit from both US Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational targeted therapies.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncogene Fusion', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Selection detection', 'Format detection', 'Deletion detection', 'Plasmid map', 'Model organisms', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'DNA sense specification', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Sequence position specification', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
251,29930011,"<i>SF3B1</i>, <i>SRSF2</i>, and <i>U2AF1</i> are the most frequently mutated splicing factor genes in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis to determine the effect of these commonly mutated splicing factors on pre-mRNA splicing in the bone marrow stem/progenitor cells and in the erythroid and myeloid precursors in splicing factor mutant MDS. Using RNA-seq, we determined the aberrantly spliced genes and dysregulated pathways in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of 84 patients with MDS. Splicing factor mutations result in different alterations in splicing and largely affect different genes, but these converge in common dysregulated pathways and cellular processes, focused on RNA splicing, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting common mechanisms of action in MDS. Many of these dysregulated pathways and cellular processes can be linked to the known disease pathophysiology associated with splicing factor mutations in MDS, whereas several others have not been previously associated with MDS, such as sirtuin signaling. We identified aberrantly spliced events associated with clinical variables, and isoforms that independently predict survival in MDS and implicate dysregulation of focal adhesion and extracellular exosomes as drivers of poor survival. Aberrantly spliced genes and dysregulated pathways were identified in the MDS-affected lineages in splicing factor mutant MDS. Functional studies demonstrated that knockdown of the mitosis regulators <i>SEPT2</i> and <i>AKAP8,</i> aberrantly spliced target genes of <i>SF3B1</i> and <i>SRSF2</i> mutations, respectively, led to impaired erythroid cell growth and differentiation. This study illuminates the effect of the common spliceosome mutations on the MDS phenotype and provides novel insights into disease pathophysiology.","['Cohort Studies', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Phosphoproteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Spliceosomes', 'Splicing Factor U2AF', 'Survival Analysis']","['Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'DNA', 'dna', 'pair', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'RNA', 'Medicine', 'Splice sites', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Splicing analysis', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis']"

We identify in BLBC tissues an anticorrelation between <i>TET1</i> expression and the major immunoregulator family nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). In vitro and in mice, <i>TET1</i> is down-regulated in breast cancer cells upon NF-κB activation through binding of p65 to its consensus sequence in the <i>TET1</i> promoter.

253,29945888,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells; however, a variant form of this disease has been described that lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR screening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) POU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful dependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of human SCLC specimens revealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack expression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a chemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling experiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell identity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can be classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, ASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in POU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These data reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft cell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of origin or a <i>trans-</i>differentiation event in this disease.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factors', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid map', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data']"

Here, we demonstrate that CBFβ-SMMHC maintains cell viability by neutralizing RUNX1-mediated repression of MYC expression. Upon pharmacologic inhibition of the CBFβ-SMMHC/RUNX1 interaction, RUNX1 shows increased binding at three MYC distal enhancers, where it represses MYC expression by mediating the replacement of the SWI/SNF complex component BRG1 with the polycomb-repressive complex component RING1B, leading to apoptosis. Combining the CBFβ-SMMHC inhibitor with the BET inhibitor JQ1 eliminates inv(16) leukemia in human cells and a mouse model. Enhancer-interaction analysis indicated that the three enhancers are physically connected with the MYC promoter, and genome-editing analysis demonstrated that they are functionally implicated in deregulation of MYC expression.

Anticipating gene expression alterations resulting from DNA copy-number variants to be particularly important, we developed a computational and experimental strategy incorporating a Bayesian algorithm and CRISPR/Cas9 ""mini-pool"" screen that enables both genome-scale assessment of disease genes and functional validation. The algorithm, called iExCN, identified 29 rhabdomyosarcoma drivers and suppressors enriched for cell-cycle and nucleic-acid-binding activities. Functional studies showed that many iExCN genes represent rhabdomyosarcoma line-specific or shared vulnerabilities. Complementary experiments addressed modes of action and demonstrated coordinated repression of multiple iExCN genes during skeletal muscle differentiation. Analysis of two separate cohorts revealed that the number of iExCN genes harboring copy-number alterations correlates with survival.

Zap70 mutant mice develop IL-17-dependent arthritis. In a mouse experimental arthritis model, NKT17 cells are increased as the disease progresses, while NKT1 numbers negatively correlates with disease severity, with this protective effect of NKT1 linked to their IFN-γ expression.

Treponema denticola utilizes serum components as nutrient sources so as to colonize and proliferate in the gingival crevice. However, the mechanisms of serum utilization remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify T. denticola serum utilization genes. Precultured T. denticola cells were suspended in a tryptone-yeast extract-gelatin-volatile fatty acids medium containing 0, 1% and 10% serum, respectively, and incubated anaerobically for 17 h. Total RNA was isolated, and T. denticola gene expression was compared by microarray and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In serum-depleted conditions, the expression levels of a potential hydroxylamine reductase, several ABC transporters, and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase were increased, while those of genes encoding methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins and a transcriptional regulator were decreased. These results suggest that T. denticola may uptake serum components mainly through the action of ABC transporters. In particular, the decrease in the dmcA expression level with decreasing serum concentration suggests its involvement in chemotaxis toward serum-rich environments.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Culture Media', 'Rabbits', 'Serum', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treponema denticola']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Spectrum', 'Mass spectrum', 'CD spectra', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

Here we report that peritoneal macrophage respiration is enhanced by rosiglitazone, an activating PPARγ ligand, in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Moreover, PPARγ is required for macrophage respiration even in the absence of exogenous ligand. Unexpectedly, the absence of PPARγ dramatically affects the oxidation of glutamine. Both glutamine and PPARγ have been implicated in alternative activation (AA) of macrophages, and PPARγ was required for interleukin 4 (IL4)-dependent gene expression and stimulation of macrophage respiration. Indeed, unstimulated macrophages lacking PPARγ contained elevated levels of the inflammation-associated metabolite itaconate and express a proinflammatory transcriptome that, remarkably, phenocopied that of macrophages depleted of glutamine. Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, and is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ expression is itself markedly increased by IL4. This suggests that PPARγ functions at the center of a feed-forward loop that is central to AA of macrophages.","['Animals', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucose', 'Glutamine', 'Interleukin-4', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PPAR gamma', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazolidinediones']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Fate map', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Active site prediction', 'Codon usage fraction calculation', 'Mice or rats', 'Gamma diversity data']"

We have defined features of GsrN structure that determine survival under hyperosmotic stress, and we have applied transcriptomic and proteomic methods to identify regulatory targets of GsrN under hyperosmotic conditions. The 5' end of GsrN, which includes a conserved cytosine-rich stem-loop structure, is necessary for cell survival after osmotic upshock. GsrN both activates and represses gene expression in this stress condition. Expression of an uncharacterized open reading frame predicted to encode a glycine zipper protein, <i>osrP</i>, is strongly activated by GsrN.

However, the comprehensive dysregulation of AS and the prospective biological and clinical relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain obscure. Here, we identified and depicted the AS landscape in HCC by performing reference-based assembly of sequencing reads from over 600 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries. We detected various differentially spliced ASEs across patients covering not only protein-coding genes, but also considerable numbers of noncoding genes. Strikingly, alternative transcription initiation was found to frequently occur in HCC. These differential ASEs were highly related to ""cancer hallmarks"" and involved in metabolism-related pathways in particular. In addition, 243 differential ASEs were identified as risk predictors for HCC patient survival. The isoform switch of metabolism-related gene UGP2 (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2) might play an essential role in HCC. We further constructed regulatory networks between RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes and the corresponding ASEs. Further analysis demonstrated that the regulated networks were enriched in a variety of metabolism-related pathways. Conclusion: Differential ASEs are prevalent in HCC, where alternative transcription initiation was found to frequently occur. We found that genes having differential ASEs were significantly enriched in metabolism-related pathways.

265,30089718,"Epithelial cells are the first line of defense against external dangers, and contribute to induction of adaptive immunity including Th17 responses. However, it is unclear whether specific epithelial signaling pathways are essential for the development of robust IL-17-mediated immune responses. In mice, the development of psoriatic inflammation induced by imiquimod required keratinocyte TRAF6. Conditional deletion of TRAF6 in keratinocytes abrogated dendritic cell activation, IL-23 production, and IL-17 production by γδ T cells at the imiquimod-treated sites. In contrast, hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity and papain-induced IgE production were not affected by loss of TRAF6. Loss of psoriatic inflammation was not solely due to defective imiquimod sensing, as subcutaneous administration of IL-23 restored IL-17 production but did not reconstitute psoriatic pathology in the mutant animals. Thus, TRAF6 was required for the full development of IL-17-mediated inflammation. Therefore, epithelial TRAF6 signaling plays an essential role in both triggering and propagating IL-17-mediated psoriatic inflammation.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Interleukin-17', 'Intraepithelial Lymphocytes', 'Keratinocytes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Psoriasis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-17', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Unimod ID', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Generation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Protein interaction data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Sequence masking', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Transcription factor name']"
266,30120247,"Polycomb group proteins are epigenetic regulators maintaining transcriptional memory during cellular proliferation. In Drosophila larvae, malfunction of Polyhomeotic (Ph), a member of the PRC1 silencing complex, results in neoplastic growth. Here, we report an intrinsic tumour suppression mechanism mediated by the steroid hormone ecdysone during metamorphosis. Ecdysone alters neoplastic growth into a nontumorigenic state of the mutant ph cells which then become eliminated during adult stage. We demonstrate that ecdysone exerts this function by inducing a heterochronic network encompassing the activation of the microRNA lethal-7, which suppresses its target gene chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis. This pathway can also promote remission of brain tumours formed in brain tumour mutants, revealing a restraining of neoplastic growth in different tumour types. Given the conserved role of let-7, the identification and molecular characterization of this innate tumour eviction mechanism in flies might provide important clues towards the exploitation of related pathways for human tumour therapy.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Ecdysone', 'Hormones', 'Metamorphosis, Biological', 'MicroRNAs', 'Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Steroids']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Information extraction', 'Format', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Lipids', 'Nucleic acids']"
267,30124938,"In Arabidopsis, the circadian clock central oscillator genes are important cellular components to generate and maintain circadian rhythms. There is a negative feedback loop between the morning expressed CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1)/LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) and evening expressed TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1). CCA1 and LHY negatively regulate the expression of TOC1, while TOC1 also binds to the promoters of CCA1 and LHY to repress their expression. Recent studies indicate that histone modifications play an important role in the regulation of the central oscillators. However, the regulatory relationship between histone modifications and the circadian clock genes remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that the Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)-like histone demethylases, LDL1 and LDL2, can interact with CCA1/LHY to repress the expression of TOC1. ChIP-Seq analysis indicated that LDL1 targets a subset of genes involved in the circadian rhythm regulated by CCA1. Furthermore, LDL1 and LDL2 interact with the histone deacetylase HDA6 and co-regulate TOC1 by histone demetylation and deacetylaion. These results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of how the circadian clock central oscillator genes are regulated through histone modifications.","['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Circadian Clocks', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Histone Code', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Histone Demethylases', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene ID', 'CATH node ID', 'Genetic code', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
268,30139917,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are lipid-derived signaling molecules with cardioprotective and vasodilatory actions. We recently showed that 11,12-EET enhances hematopoietic induction and engraftment in mice and zebrafish. EETs are known to signal via G protein-coupled receptors, with evidence supporting the existence of a specific high-affinity receptor. Identification of a hematopoietic-specific EET receptor would enable genetic interrogation of EET signaling pathways, and perhaps clinical use of this molecule. We developed a bioinformatic approach to identify an EET receptor based on the expression of G protein-coupled receptors in cell lines with differential responses to EETs. We found 10 candidate EET receptors that are expressed in three EET-responsive cell lines, but not expressed in an EET-unresponsive line. Of these, only recombinant GPR132 showed EET-responsiveness in vitro, using a luminescence-based β-arrestin recruitment assay. Knockdown of zebrafish <i>gpr132b</i> prevented EET-induced hematopoiesis, and marrow from GPR132 knockout mice showed decreased long-term engraftment capability. In contrast to high-affinity EET receptors, GPR132 is reported to respond to additional hydroxy-fatty acids in vitro, and we found that these same hydroxy-fatty acids enhance hematopoiesis in the zebrafish. We conducted structure-activity relationship analyses using both cell culture and zebrafish assays on diverse medium-chain fatty acids. Certain oxygenated, unsaturated free fatty acids showed high activation of GPR132, whereas unoxygenated or saturated fatty acids had lower activity. Absence of the carbon-1 position carboxylic acid prevented activity, suggesting that this moiety is required for receptor activation. GPR132 responds to a select panel of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids to enhance both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oxylipins', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Mathematics', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'PHYLIP format', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Protein complex', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Relation extraction', 'Structure', 'Fish']"

Here we investigated the effects of minipuberty on male and female infant human thymic tissue in order to verify if this initial transient increase in sex hormones - along the first six months of life - could affect thymic transcriptional network regulation and AIRE expression. Gene co-expression network analysis for differentially expressed genes and miRNA-target analysis revealed sex differences in thymic tissue during minipuberty, but such differences were not detected in the thymic tissue of infants aged 7-18 months, i.e. the non-puberty group. AIRE expression was essentially the same in both sexes in minipuberty and in non-puberty groups, as assessed by genomic and immunohistochemical assays. However, AIRE-interactors networks showed several differences in all groups regarding gene-gene expression correlation. Therefore, minipuberty and genomic mechanisms interact in shaping thymic sexual dimorphism along the first six months of life.","['Estrogens', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transcription Factors']","['Pathogens', 'COGEME EST ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation track', 'Ancestral reconstruction', 'Phylogenetic character data', 'Sequence mask character', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'ELAND format', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor accession']"
270,30208113,"Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis. They prevent desiccation and provide immunological and barrier defense against potential pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The study of this first line of immune defense may be hindered by invasive isolation methods and/or improper culture conditions to support stem cell maintenance and other potential mechanisms contributing to long-term subcultivation in vitro. Primary keratinocytes have been successfully isolated from blister roofs induced by negative pressure, which separates the epidermis from the dermis in vivo in human subjects. This method allows collection of pure epidermal cells without dermal contamination in a minimally invasive manner. However, the isolated keratinocytes differentiate and senesce when cultured in vitro beyond five passages. Here, we present evidence that the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 can be used to effectively increase the proliferative capabilities of keratinocytes isolated using the suction blister method, similar to what has been previously reported for primary keratinocytes isolated using alternative methods. We show that the increase in passage number is directly correlated to delayed differentiation, and that cells passaged long term with the inhibitor retain their ability to stratify in organotypic raft cultures and respond to cytokine treatment; additionally, the late passage cells have a heterogeneous mix of differentiated and non-differentiated cells which may be predicted by a ratio of select differentiation markers. The described method presents a minimally invasive procedure for keratinocyte isolation and prolonged culture that allows analysis of keratinocyte function in both healthy volunteers and patients with dermatologic diseases.","['Amides', 'Blister', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermis', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes', 'Pyridines', 'rho-Associated Kinases']","['Peptides and amino acids', 'Protein sequence', 'Amino acid identifier', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'ID list', 'Term ID list', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Generation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Cell line report', 'Epistasis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Kinase name']"

Replication stress caused by aphidicolin and hydroxyurea (HU) is a potent inducer of de novo CNVs in cultured mammalian cells. HU is used extensively for long-term management of sickle cell disease. Here, we examined the effects of HU treatment on germline CNVs in vivo in male mice to explore whether replication stress can act as a CNV mutagen in germline mitotic divisions as in cultured cells and whether this would support a concern for increased CNV mutations in offspring of men treated with HU. Several trials of HU administration were performed by oral gavage and subcutaneous pump, with CNVs characterized in C57BL/6 x C3H/HeJ hybrid mouse offspring by microarray and mate-pair sequencing. HU had a short half-life of ~14 min and a narrow dose window over which studies could be performed while maintaining fertility. Tissue histopathology and reticulocyte micronucleus assays verified that doses had a substantial tissue and genetic toxicity. CNVs were readily detected in offspring that originated in both paternal and maternal mouse strains, as de novo and inherited events. However, HU did not increase CNV formation above baseline levels. These results reveal a high rate of CNV mutagenesis in the mouse germline but do not support the hypothesis that HU would increase CNV formation during mammalian spermatogenesis, perhaps due to highly toxic effects on sperm development or experimental variables related to HU pharmacology in mice.

As expected, the numbers of UPA-seq reads mapped to known functional lncRNAs were remarkably reduced upon UV irradiation. Comparison with ENCODE eCLIP data revealed that lncRNAs that exhibited greater decreases upon UV irradiation preferentially associated with proteins containing prion-like domains (PrLDs).

276,30235878,"Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), an amino acid derivative that is endogenous to animal tissues including muscle and nerve, has been reported to enhance muscular performance. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a post-transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in nutrient-mediated myogenesis. However, the effects of GAA on myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle growth, and the potential regulatory mechanisms of miRNA in these processes have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of GAA on proliferation, differentiation, and growth in C2C12 cells and mice. The results showed that GAA markedly inhibited the proliferation of myoblasts, along with the down-regulation of cyclin D1 (<i>CCND1</i>) and cyclin dependent kinase 4 (<i>CDK4</i>) mRNA expression, and the upregulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (<i>P21</i>) mRNA expression. We also demonstrated that GAA treatment stimulated myogenic differentiation 1 (<i>MyoD</i>) and myogenin (<i>MyoG</i>) mRNA expression, resulting in an increase in the myotube fusion rate. Meanwhile, GAA supplementation promoted myotube growth through increase in total myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein level, myotubes thickness and gastrocnemius muscle cross-sectional area. Furthermore, small RNA sequencing revealed that a total of eight miRNAs, including miR-133a-3p and miR-1a-3p cluster, showed differential expression after GAA supplementation. To further study the function of miR-133a-3p and miR-1a-3p in GAA-induced skeletal muscle growth, we transfected miR-133a-3p and miR-1a-3p mimics into myotube, which also induced muscle growth. Through bioinformatics and a dual-luciferase reporter system, the target genes of miR-133a-3p and miR-1a-3p were determined. These two miRNAs were shown to modulate the Akt/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway by restraining target gene expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAA supplementation can promote myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle growth through miR-133a-3p- and miR-1a-3p-induced activation of the AKT/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Glycine', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs', 'Muscle Development', 'MyoD Protein', 'Myoblasts', 'Myogenin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Kinase name', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'KEGG Glycan ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

The European Food Safety Authority recommends testing resistance using microdilution culture techniques previously used to establish inhibitory thresholds for the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus. Many <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strains exhibit increased resistance to tetracycline, historically attributed to the ribosomal protection gene <i>tet</i>(W). However, some strains that harbor genetically identical <i>tet</i>(W) genes show various inhibition levels, suggesting that other genetic elements also contribute to observed differences. Here, we adapted several molecular assays to confirm the inhibition of <i>B. animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strains Bl-04 and HN019 and employed RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptional differences related to genomic polymorphisms. We detected specific stress responses to the antibiotic by correlating ATP concentration to number of viable genome copies from droplet digital PCR and found that the bacteria were still metabolically active in high drug concentrations. Transcriptional analyses revealed that several polymorphic regions, particularly a novel multidrug efflux transporter, were differentially expressed between the strains in each experimental condition, likely having phenotypic effects. We also found that the <i>tet</i>(W) gene was upregulated only during subinhibitory tetracycline concentrations, while two novel tetracycline resistance genes were upregulated at high concentrations. Furthermore, many genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transporter function were upregulated, while genes for complex carbohydrate utilization, protein metabolism, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat(s) (CRISPR)-Cas systems were downregulated. These results provide high-throughput means for assessing antibiotic resistances of two highly related probiotic strains and determine the genetic network that contributes to the global tetracycline response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> is widely used in human food and dietary supplements.

282,30277458,"Control of DNA copy number is essential to maintain genome stability and ensure proper cell and tissue function. In <i>Drosophila</i> polyploid cells, the SNF2-domain-containing SUUR protein inhibits replication fork progression within specific regions of the genome to promote DNA underreplication. While dissecting the function of SUUR's SNF2 domain, we identified an interaction between SUUR and Rif1. Rif1 has many roles in DNA metabolism and regulates the replication timing program. We demonstrate that repression of DNA replication is dependent on Rif1.

However, underlying mechanistic links between thermal insult in fetal life and postnatal outcomes are not completely understood. We examined morphology, DNA methylation, and gene expression of liver and mammary gland for bull calves and heifers that were gestated under maternal conditions of heat stress or cooling (i.e. in utero heat stressed vs. in utero cooled calves). Mammary tissue was harvested from dairy heifers during their first lactation and liver from bull calves at birth. The liver of in utero heat stressed bull calves contained more cells and the mammary glands of in utero heat stressed heifers were comprised of smaller alveoli. We identified more than 1,500 CpG sites differently methylated between maternal treatment groups. These CpGs were associated with approximately 400 genes, which play a role in processes, such as development, innate immune defense, cell signaling, and transcription and translation. We also identified over 100 differentially expressed genes in the mammary gland with similar functions. Interestingly, fifty differentially methylated genes were shared by both bull calf liver and heifer mammary gland. Intrauterine heat stress alters the methylation profile of liver and mammary DNA and programs their morphology in postnatal life, which may contribute to the poorer performance of in utero heat stressed calves.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cattle', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome', 'Gestational Age', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Transcription Factors', 'Uterus']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Signaling pathways', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Gene prediction', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Gene functional annotation', 'Image annotation', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'MAT', 'Mammals', 'protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Variant effect prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Virus identifier']"

Even so, the underlying termination mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved and essential termination factor Seb1 is found on Pol II near the end of the RNA exit channel and the Rpb4/7 stalk. Furthermore, the Seb1 interaction surface with Pol II largely overlaps with that of the elongation factor Spt5. Notably, Seb1 co-transcriptional recruitment is dependent on Spt5 dephosphorylation by the conserved PP1 phosphatase Dis2, which also dephosphorylates threonine 4 within the Pol II heptad repeated C-terminal domain. We propose that Dis2 orchestrates the transition from elongation to termination phase during the transcription cycle by mediating elongation to termination factor exchange and dephosphorylation of Pol II C-terminal domain.","['Peptide Elongation Factors', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Schizosaccharomyces', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Termination, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Peptide ID', 'Peptide annotation', 'Peptide identification', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcript report', 'Gene expression profiling']"
286,30283459,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including atherosclerosis, are globally the leading cause of death. Key factors contributing to onset and progression of atherosclerosis include the pro-inflammatory cytokines Interferon (IFN)α and IFNγ and the Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Together, they trigger activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)s. Searches for compounds targeting the pTyr-SH2 interaction area of STAT3, yielded many small molecules, including STATTIC and STX-0119. However, many of these inhibitors do not seem STAT3-specific. We hypothesized that multi-STAT-inhibitors that simultaneously block STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 activity and pro-inflammatory target gene expression may be a promising strategy to treat CVDs. Using comparative <i>in silico</i> docking of multiple STAT-SH2 models on multi-million compound libraries, we identified the novel multi-STAT inhibitor, C01L_F03. This compound targets the SH2 domain of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 with the same affinity and simultaneously blocks their activity and expression of multiple STAT-target genes in HMECs in response to IFNα. The same <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> multi-STAT inhibiting capacity was shown for STATTIC and STX-0119. Moreover, C01L_F03, STATTIC and STX-0119 were also able to affect genome-wide interactions between IFNγ and TLR4 by commonly inhibiting pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic gene expression directed by cooperative involvement of STATs with IRFs and/or NF-κB. Moreover, we observed that multi-STAT inhibitors could be used to inhibit IFNγ+LPS-induced HMECs migration, leukocyte adhesion to ECs as well as impairment of mesenteric artery contractility.

Here, we demonstrate that a common set of defined oncogenic drivers reproducibly reprograms normal human prostate and lung epithelial cells to small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively.

Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification. Using RNA-induced-silencing-complex precipitation, we identified 98 high-confidence miR-124 targets, of which some directly led to decreased viability. By performing advanced transcription-factor-network analysis, we identified indirect miR-124 effects on apoptosis, neuronal subtype differentiation, and the regulation of previously uncharacterized zinc finger transcription factors.

Comparing the mRNA production of embryos with normal and abnormal karyotypes allows for a deeper understanding of the protein pathways leading to viability and aberrant fetal development. In addition, identifying transcripts specific for normal or abnormal chromosome copy number could aid in the search for secreted substances that could be used to non-invasively identify embryos best suited for IVF embryo transfer. Using RNA-seq, we characterized the transcriptome of 71 normally developing human blastocysts that were karyotypically normal vs. trisomic or monosomic. Every monosomy and trisomy of the autosomal and sex chromosomes were evaluated, mostly in duplicate. We first mapped the transcriptome of three normal embryos and found that a common core of more than 3,000 genes is expressed in all embryos. These genes represent pathways related to actively dividing cells, such as ribosome biogenesis and function, spliceosome, oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle and metabolic pathways. We then compared transcriptome profiles of aneuploid embryos to those of normal embryos. We observed that non-viable embryos had a large number of dysregulated genes, some showing a hundred-fold difference in expression. On the contrary, sex chromosome abnormalities, XO and XXX displayed transcriptomes more closely mimicking those embryos with 23 normal chromosome pairs. Intriguingly, we identified a set of commonly deregulated genes in the majority of both trisomies and monosomies. This is the first paper demonstrating a comprehensive transcriptome delineation of karyotypic abnormalities found in the human pre-implantation embryo.

292,30315824,"Disrupting the protein-protein interaction for molecularly targeted cancer therapeutics can be a challenging but promising strategy. Compounds that disrupt the interaction between menin, a chromatin-binding protein, and oncogenic mixed lineage leukemia fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) have shown significant promise in preclinical models of leukemia and have a high degree of selectivity for leukemia versus normal hematopoietic cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that, in addition to disrupting the menin-MLL-FP interaction, such compounds also inhibit menin-MLL1, menin-MLL2, and other menin-interacting proteins. Here, we address the degree to which disruption of menin-MLL-FP interactions or menin-MLL1/MLL2 interactions contribute to the antileukemia effect of menin inhibition. We show that Men1 deletion in MLL-AF9-transformed leukemia cells produces distinct cellular and molecular consequences compared with Mll1;Mll2 co-deletion and that compounds disrupting menin-MLL N-terminal interactions largely phenocopy menin loss. Moreover, we show that Mll1;Mll2-deficient leukemia cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to menin interaction inhibitors, which is consistent with each regulating complementary genetic pathways. These data illustrate the heightened dependency of MLL-FPs on menin compared with wild-type MLL1/MLL2 for regulation of downstream target genes and argue that the predominant action of menin inhibitory compounds is through direct inhibition of MLL-FPs without significant contribution from MLL1/MLL2 inhibition.","['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Information extraction', 'Cell line report', 'Gene ID', 'Data management', 'Gene report', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Critical care medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein domain ID', 'Proteins']"
293,30332632,"The major types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma-have distinct immune microenvironments. We developed a genetic model of squamous NSCLC on the basis of overexpression of the transcription factor Sox2, which specifies lung basal cell fate, and loss of the tumor suppressor Lkb1 (SL mice). SL tumors recapitulated gene-expression and immune-infiltrate features of human squamous NSCLC; such features included enrichment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and decreased expression of NKX2-1, a transcriptional regulator that specifies alveolar cell fate. In Kras-driven adenocarcinomas, mis-expression of Sox2 or loss of Nkx2-1 led to TAN recruitment. TAN recruitment involved SOX2-mediated production of the chemokine CXCL5. Deletion of Nkx2-1 in SL mice (SNL) revealed that NKX2-1 suppresses SOX2-driven squamous tumorigenesis by repressing adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation. Depletion of TANs in SNL mice reduced squamous tumors, suggesting that TANs foster squamous cell fate.

However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), the aggressive form of breast cancer with no molecularly defined therapeutic target. To examine whether altered lncRNA expression contributes to the aggressive phenotype characteristic of BLBC, we performed a comparative analysis of BLBC versus non-BLBC using microarray profiling and RNA sequencing of primary breast cancer. We identified RP11-19E11.1 as a significantly up-regulated lncRNA in BLBC tumors and named it Basal-Like breast cancer Associated Transcript 1 (BLAT1). Analysis of pan-cancer datasets showed the highest expression of BLAT1 in BLBC tumors compared to all other cancers. Depletion of BLAT1 in breast cancer cells led to significantly increased apoptosis, partly because of accumulation of DNA damage. Mechanistically, BLAT1 expression is regulated at the epigenetic level via DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter. Concordantly, patients harboring tumors with BLAT1 hypomethylation showed decreased overall survival. Our results suggest that increased expression of BLAT1 via CpG site hypomethylation may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of BLBC, raising a possibility of new biomarkers for prognosis of aggressive BLBC tumors.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Basal Cell', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']","['BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'Coding region', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA sequence', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression']"

Although the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of novel N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (N<sup>6</sup>-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic mark in human disease, specifically the highly malignant brain cancer glioblastoma. Glioblastoma markedly upregulated N<sup>6</sup>-mA levels, which co-localized with heterochromatic histone modifications, predominantly H3K9me3. N<sup>6</sup>-mA levels were dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase ALKBH1, depletion of which led to transcriptional silencing of oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N<sup>6</sup>-mA regulator ALKBH1 in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma.

Fc-GLP-1 decreased transaminases, reduced intrahepatic triglycerides (TG) and improved MCD-induced liver dysfuction.

However, the benefit of Fc-GLP-1 on NASH-like features was attenuated 2 weeks post-PH and liver mass restoration was not improved. At this time-period, markers of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were further elevated in Fc-GLP-1 treated mice. Increased HSC related gene expression in livers was observed together with decreased retinyl ester content and increased retinal and retinoic acid, reflecting HSC activation.

The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a repressive chromatin modifier that plays a role in lineage commitment. However, the role of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), one of the core subunits of the NuRD complex, in neural lineage commitment is poorly understood. Here, we report that the CHD4/NuRD complex plays a critical role in neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We found that RNAi-mediated <i>Chd4</i> knockdown suppresses neural differentiation, as did knockdown of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein <i>Mbd3</i>, another NuRD subunit. <i>Chd4</i> and <i>Mbd3</i> knockdowns similarly affected changes in global gene expression during neural differentiation and up-regulated several mesendodermal genes. However, inhibition of mesendodermal genes by knocking out the master regulators of mesendodermal lineages, <i>Brachyury</i> and <i>Eomes,</i> through a CRISPR/Cas9 approach could not restore the impaired neural differentiation caused by the <i>Chd4</i> knockdown, suggesting that CHD4 controls neural differentiation by not repressing other lineage differentiation processes. Notably, <i>Chd4</i> knockdown increased the acetylation levels of p53, resulting in increased protein levels of p53. Double knockdown of <i>Chd4</i> and <i>p53</i> restored the neural differentiation rate. Furthermore, overexpression of BCL2, a downstream factor of p53, partially rescued the impaired neural differentiation caused by the <i>Chd4</i> knockdown.

Here, we report on the pan-genomic distribution of isoform-specific HIF binding in response to hypoxia of varying severity and duration, and in response to genetic ablation of each HIF-α isoform. Our findings reveal that, despite an identical consensus recognition sequence in DNA, each HIF heterodimer loads progressively at a distinct repertoire of cell-type-specific sites across the genome, with little evidence of redistribution under any of the conditions examined. Marked biases towards promoter-proximal binding of HIF-1 and promoter-distant binding of HIF-2 were observed under all conditions and were consistent in multiple cell type.

Inhibition of G9a drives lung adenocarcinoma cells towards the TPC phenotype by de-repressing genes which regulate the extracellular matrix. Depletion of G9a during tumorigenesis enriches tumors in TPCs and accelerates disease progression metastasis. Depleting histone demethylases represses G9a-regulated genes and TPC phenotypes. Demethylase inhibition impairs lung adenocarcinoma progression in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of G9a is dangerous in certain cancer contexts, and targeting the histone demethylases is a more suitable approach for lung cancer treatment.

To investigate the roles of RNAs (including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs) in the morphogenesis of P. euphratica heterophylls, juvenile heterophylls were sampled individually, and then, the expression patterns of miRNAs, mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs were analysed by small RNA sequencing and strand-specific RNA sequencing.

We determined that activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-α kinase 2/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (Eif2ak2/Eif2α) axis is the key mediator of translation initiation block in late-phase sepsis. Reversal of this axis mitigated kidney injury.

315,30510168,"Understanding the control of viral infections is of broad importance. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes decreased expression of the iron hormone hepcidin, which is regulated by hepatic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signalling. We found that HCV infection and the BMP/SMAD pathway are mutually antagonistic. HCV blunted induction of hepcidin expression by BMP6, probably via tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated downregulation of the BMP co-receptor haemojuvelin. In HCV-infected patients, disruption of the BMP6/hepcidin axis and genetic variation associated with the BMP/SMAD pathway predicted the outcome of infection, suggesting that BMP/SMAD activity influences antiviral immunity. Correspondingly, BMP6 regulated a gene repertoire reminiscent of type I interferon (IFN) signalling, including upregulating interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and downregulating an inhibitor of IFN signalling, USP18. Moreover, in BMP-stimulated cells, SMAD1 occupied loci across the genome, similar to those bound by IRF1 in IFN-stimulated cells. Functionally, BMP6 enhanced the transcriptional and antiviral response to IFN, but BMP6 and related activin proteins also potently blocked HCV replication independently of IFN. Furthermore, BMP6 and activin A suppressed growth of HBV in cell culture, and activin A inhibited Zika virus replication alone and in combination with IFN.

However, it remains unclear whether BRD4-mediated gene transcription is required for tumor cells to develop drug resistance. Our data show that prolonged treatment of luminal breast cancer cells with AKT inhibitors induces FOXO3a dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and disrupts its association with SirT6, eventually leading to FOXO3a acetylation as well as BRD4 recognition. Acetylated FOXO3a recognizes the BD2 domain of BRD4, recruits the BRD4/RNAPII complex to the CDK6 gene promoter, and induces its transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of either BRD4/FOXO3a association or CDK6 significantly overcomes the resistance of luminal breast cancer cells to AKT inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our study reports the involvement of BRD4/FOXO3a/CDK6 axis in AKTi resistance and provides potential therapeutic strategies for treating resistant breast cancer.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oxadiazoles', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines', 'Pyrroles', 'Sirtuins', 'Transcription Factors']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BEAST', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Kinase name', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'Protein report format', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound ID (BioCyc)', 'Compound name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein domains', 'Promoter ID', 'Genetic map', 'Promoter prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Protein report', 'Transposon prediction', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Molecules', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
318,30538148,"The accurate inheritance of genetic material is a basic necessity in all domains of life and an unexpectedly large number of RNA processing factors are required for mitotic progression and genome stability. NRDE2 (nuclear RNAi defective-2) is an evolutionarily conserved protein originally discovered for its role in nuclear RNA interference (RNAi) and heritable gene silencing in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>). The function of the human <i>NRDE2</i> gene remains poorly understood. Here we show that human NRDE2 is an essential protein required for suppressing intron retention in a subset of pre-mRNAs containing short, GC-rich introns with relatively weak 5' and 3' splice sites. NRDE2 preferentially interacts with components of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), the exon junction complex, and the RNA exosome. Interestingly, <i>NRDE2-</i>depleted cells exhibit greatly increased levels of genomic instability and DNA damage, as well as defects in centrosome maturation and mitotic progression. We identify the essential centriolar satellite protein, CEP131, as a direct NRDE2-regulated target. NRDE2 specifically binds to and promotes the efficient splicing of <i>CEP131</i> pre-mRNA, and depleting <i>NRDE2</i> dramatically reduces CEP131 protein expression, contributing to impaired recruitment of critical centrosomal proteins (e.g., γ-tubulin and Aurora Kinase A) to the spindle poles during mitosis. Our work establishes a conserved role for human <i>NRDE2</i> in RNA splicing, characterizes the severe genomic instability phenotypes observed upon loss of <i>NRDE2</i>, and highlights the direct regulation of <i>CEP131</i> splicing as one of multiple mechanisms through which such phenotypes might be explained.","['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Precursors', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Protein interactions', 'Citation', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"

This variation may be related to pubertal peak incidence of ileal involvement and Peyer's patches maturation, represented by IFNγ-expressing Th1 cells. However, direct mucosal evidence is lacking. We characterize the global pattern of ileal gene expression and microbial communities in 525 treatment-naive pediatric CD patients and controls (Ctl), stratifying samples by their age-of-diagnosis. We show a robust ileal gene signature notable for higher expression of specific immune genes including GM-CSF and INFγ, and reduced expression of antimicrobial Paneth cell α-defensins, in older compared to younger patients. Reduced α-defensin expression in older patients was associated with higher IFNγ expression. By comparison, the CD-associated ileal dysbiosis, characterized by expansion of Enterobacteriaceae and contraction of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, was already established within the younger group and did not vary systematically with increasing age-of-diagnosis. Multivariate analysis considering individual taxa, however did demonstrate negative associations between Lachnospiraceae and IFNγ, and positive associations between Bacteroides and α-defensin expression. These data provide evidence for maturation of mucosal Th1 immune responses and loss of epithelial antimicrobial α-defensins which are associated with specific taxa with increasing age-of-diagnosis in pediatric CD.","['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crohn Disease', 'Dysbiosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Ileum', 'Male', ""Peyer's Patches"", 'Puberty', 'Risk', 'Th1 Cells', 'alpha-Defensins']","['Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Pileup', 'MAT', 'Sequence motif matches', 'Sequence signature matches', 'Sequence motif matches (protein)', 'Sequence property', 'Protein property', 'Atomic property', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Rice', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Alpha diversity data', 'C-alpha trace']"

Recently, heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (Hp1bp3) was identified as a mediator of cognitive aging. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation for these findings and show that targeted knockdown of Hp1bp3 in the hippocampus by 50%-75% is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits and transcriptional changes reminiscent of those observed in aging and Alzheimer's disease brains. Specifically, neuroinflammatory-related pathways become activated following Hp1bp3 knockdown in combination with a robust decrease in genes involved in synaptic activity and neuronal function. To test the hypothesis that Hp1bp3 mediates susceptibility to cognitive deficits via a role in neuronal excitability, we performed slice electrophysiology demonstrate transcriptional changes after Hp1bp3 knockdown manifest functionally as a reduction in hippocampal neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity. In addition, as Hp1bp3 is a known mediator of miRNA biogenesis, here we profile the miRNA transcriptome and identify mir-223 as a putative regulator of a portion of observed mRNA changes, particularly those that are inflammatory-related. In summary, work here identifies Hp1bp3 as a critical mediator of aging-related changes at the phenotypic, cellular, and molecular level and will help inform the development of therapeutics designed to target either Hp1bp3 or its downstream effectors in order to promote cognitive longevity.","['Animals', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hippocampus', 'Humans', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phenotype', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Format detection', 'Prediction and recognition', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'R markdown', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Species name', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

We also demonstrated a tumor-promoting role of Sufu in Smo-activated MB (∼60% of human SHH MB) by maintaining robust Gli activity. Having established Gli2 activation as a key driver of SHH MB, we report a comprehensive analysis of its targetome. Furthermore, we identified Atoh1 as a target and molecular accomplice of Gli2 that activates core SHH MB signature genes in a synergistic manner.

Early spread of disseminated cancer cells (DCC) to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is indicative of poor prognosis in melanoma and early DCCs could therefore provide important information about the malignant seed. Here, we present a strategy for enrichment of DCCs from SLN suspensions using a microfluidic device (Parsortix™, Angle plc). This approach enables the detection and isolation of viable DCCs, followed by molecular analysis and identification of genetic changes. By optimizing the workflow, the established protocol allows a high recovery of DCC from melanoma patient-derived lymph node (LN) suspensions with harvest rates above 60%. We then assessed the integrity of the transcriptome and genome of individual, isolated DCCs. In LNs of melanoma patients, we detected the expression of melanoma-associated transcripts including MLANA (encoding for MelanA protein), analyzed the BRAF and NRAS mutational status and confirmed the malignant origin of isolated melanoma DCCs by comparative genomic hybridization.

We used polar granule component (pgc), a Drosophila maternal mRNA, to ask how maternal transcripts are repressed while the regulatory landscape is shifting. pgc, a germline determinant, is translationally regulated throughout oogenesis. We find that different conserved RNA-binding proteins bind a 10-nt sequence in the 3' UTR of pgc mRNA to continuously repress translation at different stages of oogenesis. Pumilio binds to this sequence in undifferentiated and early-differentiating oocytes to block Pgc translation. After differentiation, Bruno levels increase, allowing Bruno to bind the same sequence and take over translational repression of pgc mRNA.

The SREBPs, nonetheless, expanded in fungi such as the ascomycete yeasts Candida spp., raising questions about their role and evolution in these organisms. Here we report that the fungal SREBPs diversified their DNA binding preferences concomitantly with an expansion in function. We establish that several branches of fungal SREBPs preferentially bind non-palindromic DNA sequences, in contrast to the palindromic DNA motifs recognized by most basic-helix-loop-helix proteins (including SREBPs) in higher eukaryotes. Reconstruction and biochemical characterization of the likely ancestor protein suggest that an intrinsic DNA binding promiscuity in the family was resolved by alternative mechanisms in different branches of fungal SREBPs. Furthermore, we show that two SREBPs in the human commensal yeast Candida albicans drive a transcriptional cascade that inhibits a morphological switch under anaerobic conditions.

During different stages of infection, <i>Mtb</i> is surrounded by a plethora of lipid molecules and current evidence points out the relevance of fatty acids during the infectious process. In this study, we have compared the transcriptional response of <i>Mtb</i> to hypoxia in cultures supplemented with a mix of even long-chain fatty acids or dextrose as main carbon sources. Using RNA sequencing, we have identified differential expressed genes in early and late hypoxia, defined according to the <i>in vitro</i> Wayne and Hayes model, and compared the results with the exponential phase of growth in both carbon sources. We show that the number of genes over-expressed in the lipid medium was quite low in both, early and late hypoxia, relative to conditions including dextrose, with the exception of transcripts of stable and non-coding RNAs, which were more expressed in the fatty acid medium. We found that <i>sigB</i> and <i>sigE</i> were over-expressed in the early phase of hypoxia, confirming their pivotal role in early adaptation to low oxygen concentration independently of the carbon source. A drastic contrast was found with the transcriptional regulatory factors at early hypoxia. Only 2 transcriptional factors were over-expressed in early hypoxia in the lipid medium compared to 37 that were over-expressed in the dextrose medium. Instead of Rv0081, known to be the central regulator of hypoxia in dextrose, Rv2745c (ClgR), seems to play a main role in hypoxia in the fatty acid medium. The low level of genes associated to the stress-response during their adaptation to hypoxia in fatty acids, suggests that this lipid environment makes hypoxia a less stressful condition for the tubercle bacilli.

However, the effects of these epigenetic changes on the structure and function of chromatin domains have not been explored. Here, we found a functional interplay between TADs and epigenetic and transcriptional changes mediated by mutated EZH2. Altered EZH2 (p.Tyr646* (EZH2<sup>Y646X</sup>)) led to silencing of entire domains, synergistically inactivating multiple tumor suppressors. Intra-TAD gene silencing was coupled with changes of interactions between gene promoter regions.

Here we find that the nuclear exon junction complex (pre-EJC) is a critical and conserved regulator of this process. Depletion of pre-EJC subunits leads to a global decrease in Pol II pausing and to premature entry into elongation. This effect occurs, at least in part, via non-canonical recruitment of pre-EJC components at promoters. Failure to recruit the pre-EJC at promoters results in increased binding of the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) and in enhanced Pol II release. Notably, restoring pausing is sufficient to rescue exon skipping and the photoreceptor differentiation defect associated with depletion of pre-EJC components in vivo. We propose that the pre-EJC serves as an early transcriptional checkpoint to prevent premature entry into elongation, ensuring proper recruitment of RNA processing components that are necessary for exon definition.","['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA Splicing']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Exons', 'Exome sequencing', 'ASTD ID (exon)', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis']"

Due to its molecular structure and physical properties, this biopolymer has been considered as one of the most important and widely used gums in industry. However, for many of these applications this (hemi-)cellulosic structure needs to be modified or (partially) depolymerized in order to customize and improve its physicochemical properties. In this study, transcriptome, exoproteome and enzyme activity analyses were employed to decipher the complete enzymatic arsenal for guar gum depolymerization by Aspergillus niger. This multi-omic analysis revealed a set of 46 genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) responding to the presence of guar gum, including CAZymes not only with preferred activity towards galactomannan, but also towards (arabino-)xylan, cellulose, starch and pectin, likely due to trace components in guar gum. This demonstrates that the purity of substrates has a strong effect on the resulting enzyme mixture produced by A. niger and probably by other fungi as well, which has significant implications for the commercial production of fungal enzyme cocktails.","['Aspergillus niger', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Galactans', 'Mannans', 'Plant Gums', 'Polymerization']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'gxformat2', 'Human biology', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'PCR experiment', 'Forcefield parameterisation', 'PolyA signal detection']"

Low Bach2 expression levels are required to maintain high expression of the signature cytokine IL-21, the coinhibitory receptor TIGIT and the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6. In stark contrast to the regulatory network in GC B cells, Bach2 in Tfh cells is not coexpressed with Bcl-6 at high levels to inhibit the antagonizing factor Blimp-1, but suppresses Bcl-6 by direct binding to the promoter.

Transcriptomics has been a powerful tool to explore chemical-biological interactions, however, limited throughput, high-costs, and complexity of transcriptomic interpretations have yielded numerous studies lacking sufficient experimental context for predictive application. To address these challenges, we have utilized a novel high-throughput transcriptomics (HTT) platform, TempO-Seq, to apply the interpretive power of concentration-response modeling with exposures to 24 reference compounds in both differentiated and non-differentiated human HepaRG cell cultures. Our goals were to (1) explore transcriptomic characteristics distinguishing liver injury compounds, (2) assess impacts of differentiation state of HepaRG cells on baseline and compound-induced responses (eg, metabolically-activated), and (3) identify and resolve reference biological-response pathways through benchmark concentration (BMC) modeling. Study data revealed the predictive utility of this approach to identify human liver injury compounds by their respective BMCs in relation to human internal exposure plasma concentrations, and effectively distinguished drug analogs with varied associations of human liver injury (eg, withdrawn therapeutics trovafloxacin and troglitazone). Impacts of cellular differentiation state (proliferated vs differentiated) were revealed on baseline drug metabolizing enzyme expression, hepatic receptor signaling, and responsiveness to metabolically-activated toxicants (eg, cyclophosphamide, benzo(a)pyrene, and aflatoxin B1).

Inhibition of transcription elongation or depletion of cohesin decreases gene looping and formation of active compartmental domains. In contrast, depletion of condensin II, which also localizes to active chromatin, causes increased gene looping, formation of compartmental domains, and stronger intra-chromosomal compartmental interactions. Condensin II has a similar role in maintaining inter-chromosomal interactions responsible for pairing between homologous chromosomes, whereas inhibition of transcription elongation or cohesin depletion has little effect on homolog pairing.

For example, the mechanism by which exposure of the crustacean Daphnia magna to tributyltin, juvenoids, or bisphenol A increase the accumulation of storage lipids into lipid droplets is largely unknown/presently unclear. Here we analyze transcriptome changes subsequent to this lipid accumulation effect induced by either the pesticide pyriproxyfen (a juvenoid agonist), the plasticizer bisphenol A, or the antifouling agent tributyltin. Changes in the whole transcriptome were assessed after 8 and 24 h of exposure, the period showing the greatest variation in storage lipid accumulation. The three compounds affected similarly to a total of 1388 genes (965 overexpressed and 423 underexpressed transcripts), but only after 24 h of exposure. In addition, 225 transcripts became up-regulated in samples exposed to tributyltin for both 8 h and 24 h. Using D. melanogaster functional annotation, we determined that upregulated genes were enriched in members of KEGG modules implicated in fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolic pathways, as well as in genes related to membrane constituents and to chitin and cuticle metabolic pathways. Conversely, down-regulated genes appeared mainly related to visual perception and to oocyte development signaling pathways.

351,30890658,"Precise control of interferons (IFNs) is crucial to maintain immune homeostasis. Here, we demonstrated that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) was required for the production of type I IFNs in response to RNA virus infection. HIPK2 deficiency markedly impaired IFN production in macrophages after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, and HIPK2-deficient mice were more susceptible to lethal VSV disease than were wild-type mice. After VSV infection, HIPK2 was cleaved by active caspases, which released a hyperactive, N-terminal fragment that translocated to the nucleus and further augmented antiviral responses. In part, HIPK2 interacted with ELF4 and promoted its phosphorylation at Ser<sup>369</sup>, which enabled <i>Ifn-</i>b transcription. In addition, HIPK2 production was stimulated by type I IFNs to further enhance antiviral immunity. These data suggest that the kinase activity and nuclear localization of HIPK2 are essential for the production of type I IFNs.","['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors', 'Vero Cells', 'Vesicular Stomatitis', 'Vesiculovirus']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'CellML', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation']"
352,30914504,"Fungal spores germinate and undergo vegetative growth, leading to either asexual or sexual reproductive dispersal. Previous research has indicated that among developmental regulatory genes, expression is conserved across nutritional environments, whereas pathways for carbon and nitrogen metabolism appear highly responsive-perhaps to accommodate differential nutritive processing. To comprehensively investigate conidial germination and the adaptive life history decision-making underlying these two modes of reproduction, we profiled transcription of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> germinating on two media: synthetic Bird medium, designed to promote asexual reproduction; and a natural maple sap medium, on which both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction manifest. A later start to germination but faster development was observed on synthetic medium. Metabolic genes exhibited altered expression in response to nutrients-at least 34% of the genes in the genome were significantly downregulated during the first two stages of conidial germination on synthetic medium. Knockouts of genes exhibiting differential expression across development altered germination and growth rates, as well as in one case causing abnormal germination. A consensus Bayesian network of these genes indicated especially tight integration of environmental sensing, asexual and sexual development, and nitrogen metabolism on a natural medium, suggesting that in natural environments, a more dynamic and tentative balance of asexual and sexual development may be typical of <i>N. crassa</i> colonies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> One of the most remarkable successes of life is its ability to flourish in response to temporally and spatially varying environments. Fungi occupy diverse ecosystems, and their sensitivity to these environmental changes often drives major fungal life history decisions, including the major switch from vegetative growth to asexual or sexual reproduction. Spore germination comprises the first and simplest stage of vegetative growth. We examined the dependence of this early life history on the nutritional environment using genome-wide transcriptomics. We demonstrated that for developmental regulatory genes, expression was generally conserved across nutritional environments, whereas metabolic gene expression was highly labile. The level of activation of developmental genes did depend on current nutrient conditions, as did the modularity of metabolic and developmental response network interactions. This knowledge is critical to the development of future technologies that could manipulate fungal growth for medical, agricultural, or industrial purposes.","['Carbon', 'Culture Media', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Neurospora crassa', 'Nitrogen', 'Spores, Fungal']","['Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Fungi']"

Skeletal muscle regenerative capacity relies on muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) and their interplay with different cell types within the niche. However, our understanding of skeletal muscle tissue cellular composition is limited. Here, using a combined approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, we precisely mapped 10 different mononuclear cell types in adult mouse muscle. We also characterized gene signatures and determined key discriminating markers of each cell type. We identified two previously understudied cell populations in the interstitial compartment. One expresses the transcription factor scleraxis and generated tenocytes in vitro. The second expresses markers of smooth muscle and mesenchymal cells (SMMCs) and, while distinct from MuSCs, exhibited myogenic potential and promoted MuSC engraftment following transplantation.

More than half of cases arise after chemo/radio-therapy. To date, given the absence of genes within the centromeric regions, no specific molecular events have been identified in this cytogenetic subgroup. We performed the first comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analysis of MDS with dic(1;7)(q10;p10) compared to normal controls and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). RNA-seq showed a unique downregulated signature in dic(1;7) cases, affecting more than 80% of differentially expressed genes. As revealed by pathway and gene ontology analyses, downregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and lipid-related genes and upregulation of p53 signaling were the most relevant biological features of dic(1;7). Epigenetic supervised analysis revealed hypermethylation at intronic enhancers in the dicentric subgroup, in which low expression levels of enhancer putative target genes accounted for around 35% of the downregulated signature. Enrichment of Krüppel-like transcription factor binding sites emerged at enhancers. Furthermore, a specific hypermethylated pattern on 1q was found to underlie the hypo-expression of more than 50% of 1q-deregulated genes, despite trisomy.

355,30938456,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells with a central role in host immune response. This study analyzed gene expression and DC function in hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients, functions impaired because of HBV, and identified the genes related to these functions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 64 HBV patients and 19 healthy controls were analyzed. Peripheral blood DCs were stained with antibodies against human leukocyte antigen-DR/Lin-1/CD123/CD11c and separated into plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay, we analyzed antigen-specific response in HBV-infected patients. Regarding DC function, we analyzed antigen-presenting capacity, cell migration capacity, phagocytic capacity, and cytokine production capacity. DC gene expression was analyzed by microarray to identify genes related to DC function. No difference was found in the number of DCs in peripheral blood between healthy participants and HBV patients. In cell-surface marker analysis, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40, and C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 expression levels in pDCs were related to the HBV-specific T-cell response. DCs from HBV patients exhibited decreases in antigen-presenting capacity, migration capacity, and cytokine production capacity. In gene expression analysis, immune-related genes with greatly reduced expression levels in chronic hepatitis B patients were identified. Of these genes, interleukin (IL)-6 signal transducer (IL6ST) expression level positively correlated with DC surface marker expression level. Adjustment of IL6ST expression level in DCs and treatment with oncostatin M resulted in recovery of DC function. Conclusion: IL6ST expression was identified as one cause of decline in DC function in HBV patients. Adjustment of IL6 family cytokine signaling may be useful for recovering reduced DC function in HBV infection.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hepatitis B', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'cel', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Cytogenetics']"

Though functional inactivation of the Hippo pathway is common in tumors, mutations in core pathway components are rare. Thus, understanding how tumor cells inactivate Hippo signaling remains a key unresolved question. Here, we identify the kinase STK25 as an activator of Hippo signaling. We demonstrate that loss of STK25 promotes YAP/TAZ activation and enhanced cellular proliferation, even under normally growth-suppressive conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, STK25 activates LATS by promoting LATS activation loop phosphorylation independent of a preceding phosphorylation event at the hydrophobic motif, which represents a form of Hippo activation distinct from other kinase activators of LATS. STK25 is significantly focally deleted across a wide spectrum of human cancers, suggesting STK25 loss may represent a common mechanism by which tumor cells functionally impair the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway.","['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Tumor annotation', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Here, we employ a computational model of underground metabolism and laboratory evolution experiments to examine the role of enzyme promiscuity in the acquisition and optimization of growth on predicted non-native substrates in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 MG1655. After as few as approximately 20 generations, evolved populations repeatedly acquired the capacity to grow on five predicted non-native substrates-D-lyxose, D-2-deoxyribose, D-arabinose, m-tartrate, and monomethyl succinate. Altered promiscuous activities were shown to be directly involved in establishing high-efficiency pathways.

We show that PpDNMT3b mediates CG and CHH de novo methylation, independently of PpDRMs. Complementary de novo CHG methylation is specifically mediated by the CHROMOMETHYLASE, PpCMT. Intragenomically, PpDNMT3b functions preferentially within heterochromatin and is affected by PpCMT. In comparison, PpDRMs target active-euchromatic transposons.

PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance. We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression.

We therefore examined a potential synergistic effect of simultaneous PU.1 downregulation and CITED2 upregulation on stem cell biology and AML pathogenesis. We found that simultaneous PU.1/CITED2 deregulation in human CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood (CB) cells, as well as CITED2 upregulation in preleukemic murine PU.1-knockdown (PU.1<sup>KD/KD</sup>) bone marrow cells, significantly increased the maintenance of HSPCs compared with the respective deregulation of either factor alone. Increased replating capacity of PU.1<sup>KD/KD</sup>/CITED2 cells in in vitro assays eventually resulted in outgrowth of transformed cells, while upregulation of CITED2 in PU.1<sup>KD/KD</sup> cells enhanced their engraftment in in vivo transplantation studies without affecting leukemic transformation. Transcriptional analysis of CD34<sup>+</sup> CB cells with combined PU.1/CITED2 alterations revealed a set of differentially expressed genes that highly correlated with gene signatures found in various AML subtypes.

Although protein arginine methyltransferases have been shown to play oncogenic roles in a variety of cancers, little is known about the role of arginine methylation in regulating the antiproliferation activity of C/EBPα. Here, we report that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is overexpressed in human breast cancer and that elevated PRMT1 correlates with cancer malignancy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that knockdown of PRMT1 in breast cancer cells is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of pro-proliferative genes, including cyclin D1. Furthermore, tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry identified PRMT1 as a component of the C/EBPα complex. C/EBPα associated with and was methylated by PRMT1 at three arginine residues (R35, R156, and R165). PRMT1-dependent methylation of C/EBPα promoted the expression of cyclin D1 by blocking the interaction between C/EBPα and its corepressor HDAC3, which resulted in rapid growth of tumor cells during the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Inhibition of PRMT1 significantly impeded the growth of cancer cells from patients with triple-negative breast cancer. This evidence that PRMT1 mediates C/EBPα methylation sheds light on a novel pathway and potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.

However, how STUbLs select specific substrates among myriads of SUMOylated proteins on chromatin remains unclear. Here, we reveal a remarkable co-localization of the budding yeast STUbL Slx5/Slx8 and ubiquitin at seven genomic loci that we term ""ubiquitin hotspots"". Ubiquitylation at these sites depends on Slx5/Slx8 and protein turnover on the Cdc48 segregase. We identify the transcription factor-like Ymr111c/Euc1 to associate with these sites and to be a critical determinant of ubiquitylation. Euc1 specifically targets Slx5/Slx8 to ubiquitin hotspots via bipartite binding of Slx5 that involves the Slx5 SUMO-interacting motifs and an additional, novel substrate recognition domain. Interestingly, the Euc1-ubiquitin hotspot pathway acts redundantly with chromatin modifiers of the H2A.Z and Rpd3L pathways in specific stress responses.

While several therapeutic target molecules for lung adenocarcinoma have been identified, little is known about lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We recently reported that CD271 (p75 neurotrophin receptor) serves as a marker for tumor initiation and is a key regulator of cell proliferation in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we found that CD271 was also expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, but not in adenocarcinoma, of several tissues, including the lung, and the expression of CD271 was associated with a poor prognosis in LSCC. To examine CD271's role in LSCC, we established xenograft cell lines from LSCC patients. Within the sorted live LSCC cell population, the CD271<sup>high</sup> cells were primarily cycling through the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase, while the CD271<sup>low</sup> cells were mostly in the G<sub>0</sub> phase. CD271 knockdown in the LSCC cells completely suppressed their proliferation and tumor-formation capability, and increased their cell-cycle arrest in the G<sub>0</sub> phase. In the CD271-knockdown cells, ERK-phosphorylation was decreased, while no change was observed in the IκBα-phosphorylation, p65-phosphorylation, or Akt-phosphorylation. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased the LSCC cells' proliferation capability. Microarray analysis revealed that CD271 knockdown attenuated the RAS-related pathways. The knockdown of TrkB, which forms a heterodimer with CD271 and accelerates its downstream signaling, partially inhibited the LSCC cell proliferation.

366,31020902,"Background Oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPC s) regulate neuronal, glial, and vascular systems in diverse ways and display phenotypic heterogeneity beyond their established role as a reservoir for mature oligodendrocytes. However, the detailed phenotypic changes of OPC s after cerebral ischemia remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the roles of reactive OPC s in the ischemic brain. Methods and Results The behavior of OPC s was evaluated in a mouse model of ischemic stroke produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo. For in vitro experiments, the phenotypic change of OPC s after oxygen glucose derivation was examined using a primary rat OPC culture. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of hypoxic OPC s was evaluated in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo. Perivascular OPC s in the cerebral cortex were increased alongside poststroke angiogenesis in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. In vitro RNA -seq analysis revealed that primary cultured OPC s increased the gene expression of numerous pro-angiogenic factors after oxygen glucose derivation. Hypoxic OPC s secreted a greater amount of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1, compared with normoxic OPC s. Hypoxic OPC -derived conditioned media increased the viability and tube formation of endothelial cells.

Conclusions Following cerebral ischemia, the phenotype of OPC s in the cerebral cortex shifts from the parenchymal subtype to the perivascular subtype, which can promote angiogenesis.

367,31023876,"The endocardium interacts with the myocardium to promote proliferation and morphogenesis during the later stages of heart development. However, the role of the endocardium in early cardiac ontogeny remains under-explored. Given the shared origin, subsequent juxtaposition, and essential cell-cell interactions of endocardial and myocardial cells throughout heart development, we hypothesized that paracrine signaling from the endocardium to the myocardium is crucial for initiating early differentiation of myocardial cells. To test this, we generated an <i>in vitro</i>, endocardial-specific ablation model using the diphtheria toxin receptor under the regulatory elements of the <i>Nfat</i><i>c1</i> genomic locus (<i>NFATc1-DTR</i>). Early treatment of <i>NFATc1-DTR</i> mouse embryoid bodies with diphtheria toxin efficiently ablated endocardial cells, which significantly attenuated the percentage of beating EBs in culture and expression of early and late myocardial differentiation markers. The addition of Bmp2 during endocardial ablation partially rescued myocyte differentiation, maturation and function. Therefore, we conclude that early stages of myocardial differentiation rely on endocardial paracrine signaling mediated in part by Bmp2. Our findings provide novel insight into early endocardial-myocardial interactions that can be explored to promote early myocardial development and growth.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Endocardium', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myocardium', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Organogenesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Cytometry', 'Protein geometry data', 'Flow cell identifier', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Light microscopy', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Genetic organisation', 'Repeat sequence organisation analysis', 'Model organisms', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Reaction ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
368,31039138,"Monosomy 7 or deletion of 7q (del(7q)) are common clonal cytogenetic abnormalities associated with high grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) arising in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure. Current non-transplant approaches to treat marrow failure may be complicated by stimulation of clonal outgrowth. To study the biological consequences of del(7q) within the context of a failing marrow, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with Shwachman Diamond Syndrome (SDS), a bone marrow failure disorder with MDS predisposition, and genomically engineered a 7q deletion. The TGFβ pathway was the top differentially regulated pathway in transcriptomic analysis of SDS versus SDSdel(7q) iPSCs. SMAD2 phosphorylation was increased in SDS relative to wild type cells consistent with hyperactivation of the TGFbeta pathway in SDS. Phospho-SMAD2 levels were reduced following 7q deletion in SDS cells and increased upon restoration of 7q diploidy. Inhibition of the TGFbeta pathway rescued hematopoiesis in SDS-iPSCs and in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from SDS patients while it had no impact on the SDSdel(7q) cells. These results identified a potential targetable vulnerability to improve hematopoiesis in an MDS-predisposition syndrome, and highlight the importance of the germline context of somatic alterations to inform precision medicine approaches to therapy.","['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Engineering', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precision Medicine', 'RNA-Seq', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta']","['ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Genetic engineering', 'Bioengineering', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Chromosomes', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Genotyping', 'Genotyping experiment', 'Eukaryotes', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Personalised medicine', 'Medicine', 'Pain medicine', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Here, we use multiple RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, including cell type-specific, temporal bulk RNA-seq, in vivo GEO-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), to characterize the detailed spatiotemporal transcriptome during hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of zebrafish. Combinatorial expression profiling reveals that, in the CHT niche, HSPCs and their neighboring supporting cells are co-regulated by shared signaling pathways and intrinsic factors, such as integrin signaling and Smchd1. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis unveils the strong association between cell cycle status and HSPC differentiation.

370,31043422,"A deficiency in BRG1, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, results in a meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis. Here, we explore the causative mechanisms. BRG1 is preferentially enriched at active promoters of genes essential for spermatogonial pluripotency and meiosis. In contrast, BRG1 is also associated with the repression of somatic genes. Chromatin accessibility at these target promoters is dependent upon BRG1. These results favor a model in which BRG1 coordinates spermatogenic transcription to ensure meiotic progression. In spermatocytes, BRG1 interacts with SCML2, a testis-specific PRC1 factor that is associated with the repression of somatic genes. We present evidence to suggest that BRG1 and SCML2 concordantly regulate genes during meiosis. Furthermore, BRG1 is required for the proper localization of SCML2 and its associated deubiquitylase, USP7, to the sex chromosomes during pachynema. SCML2-associated mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and acetylation of histone lysine 27 (H3K27ac) are elevated in <i>Brg1<sup>cKO</sup></i> testes. Coincidentally, the PRC1 ubiquitin ligase RNF2 is activated while a histone H2A/H2B deubiquitylase USP3 is repressed. Thus, BRG1 impacts the male epigenome by influencing the localization and expression of epigenetic modifiers.

However, the molecular pathology underpinning the clinical features of DLBCL in HIV(+) patients relative to the general population is poorly understood. We performed a retrospective study examining the transcriptional, genomic and protein expression differences between HIV(+) and HIV(-) germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL cases using digital gene expression analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Genes associated with cell cycle progression (CCNA2, CCNB1, CDC25A, E2F1), DNA replication (MCM2, MCM4, MCM7) and DNA damage repair, including eight Fanconi anemia genes (FANCA, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCE, FANCG, FANCR/RAD51, FANCS/BRCA1, FANCT/UBE2T, FANCV/MAD2L2), were significantly increased in HIV(+) GCB-DLBCL tumors compared to HIV(-) tumors. In contrast, genes associated with cell cycle inhibition (CDKN1A, CDKN1B) as well as apoptosis regulating BCL2 family members (BCL2, BAX, BIM, BMF, PUMA) were significantly decreased in the HIV(+) cohort. BCL2 IHC confirmed this expression. Array CGH data revealed that HIV(+) GCB-DLBCL tumors have fewer copy number variations than their HIV(-) counterparts, indicating enhanced genomic stability. Together, the results show that HIV(+) GCB-DLBCL is a distinct molecular malignancy from HIV(-) GCB-DLBCL; with an increased proliferative capacity, confirmed by Ki67 IHC staining, and enhanced genomic stability, the latter of which is likely related to the enhanced expression of DNA repair genes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomic Instability', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Comparative genomics', 'Protein modelling', 'Genome comparison', 'DNA', 'dna', 'pair', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Genomics', 'Annotation track', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Protein interactions', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'MAT', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum']"

We found that two endosperm-specific NAC transcription factors, ZmNAC128 and ZmNAC130, have such a regulatory function. Knockdown of expression of <i>ZmNAC128</i> and <i>ZmNAC130</i> with RNA interference (RNAi) caused a shrunken kernel phenotype with significant reduction of starch and protein. We could show that ZmNAC128 and ZmNAC130 regulate the transcription of <i>Bt2</i> and then reduce its protein level, a rate-limiting step in starch synthesis of maize endosperm. Lack of ZmNAC128 and ZmNAC130 also reduced accumulation of zeins and nonzeins by 18% and 24% compared with nontransgenic siblings, respectively. Although ZmNAC128 and ZmNAC130 affected expression of zein genes in general, they specifically activated transcription of the <i>16-kDa γ-zein</i> gene. The two transcription factors did not dimerize with each other but exemplified redundancy, whereas individual discovery of their function was not amenable to conventional genetics but illustrated the power of RNAi. Given that both the <i>Bt2</i> and the <i>16-kDa γ-zein</i> genes were activated by ZmNAC128 or ZmNAC130, we could identify a core binding site ACGCAA contained within their target promoter regions by combining Dual-Luciferase Reporter and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift assays.

375,31116734,"XX and XY fetal gonads are initially bipotential, poised between the ovary and testis fate. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that commitment to testis fate requires the repression of genes associated with ovary fate. It was previously shown that loss of CBX2, the subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that binds H3K27me3 and mediates silencing, leads to ovary development in XY mice and humans. While it had been proposed that CBX2 is an activator of the testis-determining gene Sry, we investigated the alternative possibility that CBX2 has a direct role as a repressor of the antagonistic ovary-promoting pathway. To investigate this possibility, we developed a quantitative genome-wide profile of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and its active counterpart H3K4me3 in isolated XY and XX gonadal supporting cells before and after sex determination. We show that testis and ovary sex-determining (SD) genes are bivalent before sex determination, providing insight into how the bipotential state of the gonad is established at the epigenetic level. After sex determination, many SD genes of the alternate pathway remain bivalent, possibly contributing to the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate even in adults. The finding that many genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were targeted for H3K27me3-mediated repression in Sertoli cells led us to test whether deletion of Wnt4 could rescue testis development in Cbx2 mutants. We show that Sry expression and testis development were rescued in XY Cbx2-/-;Wnt4-/- mice. Furthermore, we show that CBX2 directly binds the downstream Wnt signaler Lef1, an ovary-promoting gene that remains bivalent in Sertoli cells. Our results suggest that stabilization of the testis fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent ovary-determining genes, which would otherwise block testis development.","['Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 9', 'Forkhead Box Protein L2', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Ovary', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors', 'Sex Determination Processes', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Testis', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Wnt4 Protein']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Exonic splicing enhancer prediction', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecule accession', 'Molecule name', 'Molecule report', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription', 'Structure determination', 'Recombination detection', 'Annotation processing', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Protein name']"

However, the role of PI3K in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), particularly during hematopoietic stress, is still unclear. We previously showed that the individual PI3K catalytic isoforms P110α or P110β have dispensable roles in HSC function, suggesting redundancy between PI3K isoforms in HSCs. We now demonstrate that simultaneous deletion of P110α and P110δ in double knockout (DKO) HSCs uncovers their redundant requirement in HSC cycling after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy administration. In contrast, DKO HSCs are still able to exit quiescence in response to other stress stimuli, such as LPS. We found that DKO HSCs and progenitors have impaired sensing of inflammatory signals ex vivo, and that levels of IL1-β and MIG are higher in the bone marrow after LPS than after 5-FU administration.

Whether this occurs in human neuromuscular tissue, particularly for the noncoding transcriptome, and independent of metabolic and aerobic capacities, is unknown. Applying our novel RNA method to quantify tissue coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), we identified ~800 transcripts tracking with age up to ~60 years in human muscle and brain. In silico analysis demonstrated that this temporary linear ""signature"" was regulated by drugs, which reduce mortality or extend life span in model organisms, including 24 inhibitors of the IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR pathway that mimicked, and 5 activators that opposed, the signature. We profiled Rapamycin in nondividing primary human myotubes (n = 32 HTA 2.0 arrays) and determined the transcript signature for reactive oxygen species in neurons, confirming that our age signature was largely regulated in the ""pro-longevity"" direction. Quantitative network modeling demonstrated that age-regulated ncRNA equaled the contribution of protein-coding RNA within structures, but tended to have a lower heritability, implying lncRNA may better reflect environmental influences. Genes ECSIT, UNC13, and SKAP2 contributed to a network that did not respond to Rapamycin, and was associated with ""neuron apoptotic processes"" in protein-protein interaction analysis (FDR = 2.4%). ECSIT links inflammation with the continued age-related downwards trajectory of mitochondrial complex I gene expression (FDR < 0.01%), implying that sustained inhibition of ECSIT may be maladaptive.

CYP2B metabolizes multiple endo- and xenobiotics, and recent data suggests that repression of Cyp2b activity increases dyslipidemia and age-onset obesity, especially in males. To investigate the role played by Cyp2b in lipid homeostasis and obesity, we treated wildtype and Cyp2b-null mice with a normal (ND) or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks and determined metabolic and molecular changes. Male HFD-fed Cyp2b-null mice weigh 15% more than HFD-fed wildtype mice, primarily due to an increase in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, Cyp2b-null female mice did not demonstrate greater body mass or WAT. Serum parameters indicate increased ketosis, leptin and cholesterol in HFD-fed Cyp2b-null male mice compared to HFD-fed wildtype mice. Liver triglycerides and liver:serum triglyceride ratios were higher than their similarly treated wildtype counterparts in Cyp2b-null male mice, indicating a role for Cyp2b in fatty acid metabolism regardless of diet. Furthermore, RNAseq demonstrates that hepatic gene expression in ND-fed Cyp2b-null male mice is similar to HFD-fed WT male mice, suggestive of fatty liver disease progression and a role for Cyp2b in lipid homeostasis. Females did not show as demonstrative changes in liver health, and significantly fewer changes in gene expression, as well as gene expression associated with liver disease.

By analyzing the DNA copy number profiles of 1000 DLBCL tumors, we identified gains of 18q21.2 as the most frequent genetic alteration in ABC-like DLBCL. Using integrative analysis of matched gene expression profiling data, we found that the <i>TCF4</i> (<i>E2-2</i>) transcription factor gene was the target of these alterations. Overexpression of <i>TCF4</i> in ABC-like DLBCL cell lines led to its occupancy on immunoglobulin (<i>IGHM</i>) and <i>MYC</i> gene enhancers and increased expression of these genes at the transcript and protein levels. Inhibition of TCF4 activity with dominant-negative constructs was synthetically lethal to ABC-like DLBCL cell lines harboring <i>TCF4</i> DNA copy gains, highlighting these gains as an attractive potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, the <i>TCF4</i> gene was one of the top BRD4-regulated genes in DLBCL cell lines. BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) ARV771 extinguished TCF4, MYC, and IgM expression and killed ABC-like DLBCL cells in vitro.

Here, we show that the anti-tumorigenic effect of KLF4 extends to PC3 human prostate cancer cells growing in the bone. We compared KLF4 null cells with cells transduced with a DOX-inducible KLF4 expression system, and find KLF4 function inhibits PC3 growth in monolayer and soft agar cultures. Furthermore, KLF4 null cells proliferate rapidly, forming large, invasive, and osteolytic tumors when injected into mouse femurs, whereas KLF4 re-expression immediately after their intra-femoral inoculation blocks tumor development and preserves a normal bone architecture. KLF4 re-expression in established KLF4 null bone tumors inhibits their osteolytic effects, preventing bone fractures and inducing an osteogenic response with new bone formation. In addition to these profound biological changes, KLF4 also induces a transcriptional shift from an osteolytic program in KLF4 null cells to an osteogenic program. Importantly, bioinformatic analysis shows that genes regulated by KLF4 overlap significantly with those expressed in metastatic prostate cancer patients and in three individual cohorts with bone metastases, strengthening the clinical relevance of the findings in our xenograft model.","['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osteolysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Heterogen annotation', 'R script', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Analysis', 'Protein cleavage sites and proteolysis', 'Protein analysis']"

Here, we investigated the nuclear role of Aco2 by deleting its nuclear localization signal. The aco2ΔNLS mutation suppressed the gene-silencing defects of RNAi mutants at the centromere, where heterochromatin formation depends on RNAi pathway. In Δago1, the aco2ΔNLS mutation restored heterochromatin through elevating Chp1 binding. Aco2 physically interacted with Chp1 via the N-terminal chromodomain that binds to methylated histone H3K9. In the sub-telomeric region, where heterochromatin forms independent of RNAi pathway, the single aco2ΔNLS mutation caused extra gene silencing via elevating Chp1 binding, without increasing histone methylation. The anti-silencing effect did not require the catalytic function of aconitase. Taken together, Aco2 functions as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression, through associating with chromodomain of Chp1 to maintain heterochromatin.","['Aconitate Hydratase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Centromere', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA, Fungal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterochromatin', 'Histones', 'Iron Regulatory Protein 1', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Protein Binding', 'Schizosaccharomyces', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion']","['Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate accession', 'Carbohydrate report', 'Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'RNA central ID', 'Concentration', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Gene ID', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Histogram', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Expression signals', 'PTM localisation', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Protein accession', 'Sequence', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map']"

We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. We find that loss of NF-Y binding in mammalian cells disrupts the promoter chromatin landscape, leading to nucleosomal encroachment over the canonical TSS. Importantly, this chromatin rearrangement is accompanied by upstream relocation of the transcription pre-initiation complex and ectopic transcription initiation. Further, this phenomenon generates aberrant extended transcripts that undergo translation, disrupting gene expression profiles.

Our data thus indicate a first-in-class link between a cancer driver mutation in a TF and a druggable, direct transcriptional target.","[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms']","['nucleotide', 'Nucleotide base annotation', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Linked data format', 'protein', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleotide identifier', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data']"
398,31311971,"Isolated human islets do not always meet the quality standards required for transplant survival and reliable functional in vitro studies. The formation of pseudoislets, i.e. the reaggregation of a defined number of islet cells after dissociation, improves insulin secretion. We present a simple method of pseudoislet formation from human islet cells and assess the transcriptome and function of isolated human islets and pseudoislets from the same organ donors. Following pseudoislet formation, insulin content/DNA and mRNA/RPS13 resembled that of islets. In pseudoislets, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was significantly higher (8-13-fold) than in islets (2-4-fold). GSIS of pseudoislets was partly inhibited by the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist exendin-9. The stimulatory effects of palmitate and forskolin at 12 mM glucose were also significantly higher in pseudoislets than in islets. Further analysis of pseudoislets revealed that regulation of secretion and insulin and glucagon content was maintained over a longer culture period (6-14 d). While adrenaline inhibited GSIS, adrenaline together with palmitate stimulated glucagon secretion 2-fold at low glucose, an effect suppressed by high glucose. Transcriptome analysis revealed that, unlike islets, pseudoislets were deprived of exocrine and endothelial cells. In conclusion, pseudoislet formation restores functional integrity of human islet cells and allows long-term in vitro testing.","['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epinephrine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Transporter Type 2', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Islet Amyloid Polypeptide', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Palmitates', 'Tissue Donors']","['Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Marine biology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'MAT', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Biobank']"

400,31327044,"Microsatellite repeat expansion disease loci can exhibit pleiotropic clinical and biological effects depending on repeat length. Large expansions in C9orf72 (100s-1000s of units) are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). However, whether intermediate expansions also contribute to neurodegenerative disease is not well understood. Several studies have identified intermediate repeats in Parkinson's disease patients, but the association was not found in autopsy-confirmed cases. We hypothesized that intermediate C9orf72 repeats are a genetic risk factor for corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a neurodegenerative disease that can be clinically similar to Parkinson's but has distinct tau protein pathology. Indeed, intermediate C9orf72 repeats were significantly enriched in autopsy-proven CBD (n = 354 cases, odds ratio = 3.59, p = 0.00024). While large C9orf72 repeat expansions are known to decrease C9orf72 expression, intermediate C9orf72 repeats result in increased C9orf72 expression in human brain tissue and CRISPR/cas9 knockin iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells. In contrast to cases of FTD/ALS with large C9orf72 expansions, CBD with intermediate C9orf72 repeats was not associated with pathologic RNA foci or dipeptide repeat protein aggregates. Knock-in cells with intermediate repeats exhibit numerous changes in gene expression pathways relating to vesicle trafficking and autophagy. Additionally, overexpression of C9orf72 without the repeat expansion leads to defects in autophagy under nutrient starvation conditions. These results raise the possibility that therapeutic strategies to reduce C9orf72 expression may be beneficial for the treatment of CBD.","['Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Autophagy', 'Basal Ganglia Diseases', 'Brain', 'C9orf72 Protein', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Humans', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease identifier', 'Author ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Geotemporal metadata', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Disease name', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order']"

We sought to identify kinases uniquely up-regulated in different NHL subtypes. Using multiplexed inhibitor bead-mass spectrometry (MIB/MS), we found Tyro3 was uniquely up-regulated and important for cell survival in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), which is a viral lymphoma infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Tyro3 was also highly expressed in PEL cell lines as well as in primary PEL exudates. Based on this discovery, we developed an inhibitor against Tyro3 named UNC3810A, which hindered cell growth in PEL, but not in other NHL subtypes where Tyro3 was not highly expressed. UNC3810A also significantly inhibited tumor progression in a PEL xenograft mouse model that was not seen in a non-PEL NHL model.

Here we show that human and mouse cerebellar microglia express a unique molecular program distinct from forebrain microglia. Cerebellar microglial identity was driven by the CSF-1R ligand CSF-1, independently of the alternate CSF-1R ligand, IL-34. Accordingly, CSF-1 depletion from Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells led to severe depletion and transcriptional alterations of cerebellar microglia, while microglia in the forebrain remained intact. Strikingly, CSF-1 deficiency and alteration of cerebellar microglia were associated with reduced Purkinje cells, altered neuronal function, and defects in motor learning and social novelty interactions.

405,31371376,"Reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling is essential for morphogenesis, including branching of the lung. In the mouse, mesenchymal cells differentiate into airway smooth muscle that wraps around epithelial branches, but this contractile tissue is absent from the early avian lung. Here, we have found that branching morphogenesis in the embryonic chicken lung requires extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling driven by reciprocal interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Before branching, the basement membrane wraps the airway epithelium as a spatially uniform sheath. After branch initiation, however, the basement membrane thins at branch tips; this remodeling requires mesenchymal expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2, which is necessary for branch extension but for not branch initiation. As branches extend, tenascin C (TNC) accumulates in the mesenchyme several cell diameters away from the epithelium. Despite its pattern of accumulation, TNC is expressed exclusively by epithelial cells. Branch extension coincides with deformation of adjacent mesenchymal cells, which correlates with an increase in mesenchymal fluidity at branch tips that may transport TNC away from the epithelium. These data reveal novel epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that direct ECM remodeling during airway branching morphogenesis.","['Animals', 'Basement Membrane', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Shape', 'Chick Embryo', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Lung', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mesoderm', 'Morphogenesis', 'Respiratory Mucosa', 'Tenascin', 'Tissue Culture Techniques']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Transmembrane protein database search', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Microfluidics', 'Rigid body refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell type name', 'Cell type identifier', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Data retrieval', 'Protein distance matrix', 'protein', 'Keyword', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Biobank']"

We have identified differentially methylated CpG sites associated with EMT, found at promoters of epithelial genes and GRHL2 binding sites. GRHL2 knockdown results in CpG methylation gain and nucleosomal remodeling (reduction in permissive marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; elevated repressive mark H3K27me3), resembling the changes observed across progressive EMT states. Epigenetic-modifying agents such as 5-azacitidine, GSK126 and mocetinostat further reveal cell state-dependent plasticity upon GRHL2 overexpression.

412,31396629,"In all biological systems, RNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming complexes that control gene regulatory mechanisms, from RNA synthesis to decay. In mammalian mitochondria, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is conducted by mitochondrial RBPs (mt-RBPs) at various stages of mt-RNA metabolism, including polycistronic transcript production, its processing into individual transcripts, mt-RNA modifications, stability, translation and degradation. To date, only a handful of mt-RBPs have been characterized. Here, we describe a putative human mitochondrial protein, C6orf203, that contains an S4-like domain-an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding domain previously identified in proteins involved in translation. Our data show C6orf203 to bind highly structured RNA in vitro and associate with the mitoribosomal large subunit in HEK293T cells. Knockout of C6orf203 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial translation and consequent OXPHOS deficiency, without affecting mitochondrial RNA levels. Although mitoribosome stability is not affected in C6orf203-depleted cells, mitoribosome profiling analysis revealed a global disruption of the association of mt-mRNAs with the mitoribosome, suggesting that C6orf203 may be required for the proper maturation and functioning of the mitoribosome.

Optimal genomic recruitment of Foxp3 and Bcl11b is critically interdependent. Genome-wide occupancy studies coupled with gene expression profiling reveal that Bcl11b, in association with Foxp3, is primarily responsible in establishing a T<sub>reg</sub>-specific gene activation program. Furthermore, Bcl11b restricts misdirected recruitment of Foxp3 to sites, which would otherwise result in an altered T<sub>reg</sub> transcriptome profile. Consequently, T<sub>reg</sub>-specific ablation of Bcl11b results in marked breakdown of immune tolerance, leading to aggressive systemic autoimmunity.

419,31487267,"SH3 domain-binding protein that preferentially associates with Btk (SAB) is an outer-membrane docking protein for JNK-mediated impairment of mitochondrial function. Deletion of Sab in hepatocytes inhibits sustained JNK activation and cell death. The current study demonstrates that an increase in SAB expression enhanced the severity of acetaminophen-induced (APAP-induced) liver injury. Female mice were resistant to liver injury and exhibited markedly decreased hepatic SAB protein expression compared with male mice. The mechanism of SAB repression involved a pathway from ERα to p53 expression that induced miR34a-5p. miR34a-5p targeted the Sab mRNA coding region, thereby repressing SAB expression. Fulvestrant or p53 knockdown decreased miR34a-5p and increased SAB expression in female mice, leading to increased injury from APAP and TNF/galactosamine. In contrast, an ERα agonist increased p53 and miR34a-5p, which decreased SAB expression and hepatotoxicity in male mice. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of miR34a also increased the severity of liver injury in female mice, which was prevented by GalNAc-ASO knockdown of Sab. Similar to mice, premenopausal women expressed elevated levels of hepatic p53 and low levels of SAB, whereas age-matched men expressed low levels of p53 and high levels of SAB, but there was no difference in SAB expression between the sexes in the postmenopausal stage. In conclusion, SAB expression levels determined the severity of JNK-dependent liver injury. Female mice expressed low levels of hepatic SAB protein because of the ERα/p53/miR34a pathway, which repressed SAB expression and accounted for the resistance to liver injury seen in these females.","['Acetaminophen', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Death', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mitochondria, Liver', 'Mitochondrial Membranes', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Necrosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']","['ACE', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Compound name', 'Cheminformatics', 'Chemical name (INN)', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mitochondria', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Prosite accession number', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Tumor annotation', 'Protein expression']"

Our results also denote a vital role for AMPK in promoting proper chromosomal alignment, as loss of AMPK activity leads to misaligned chromosomes and concomitant metaphase delay.

Conditional deletion of Hippo pathway kinases, <i>Lats1</i> and <i>Lats2</i>, in uninjured CFs initiated a self-perpetuating fibrotic response in the adult heart that was exacerbated by myocardial infarction (MI). Single cell transcriptomics showed that uninjured <i>Lats1/2</i> mutant CFs spontaneously transitioned to a myofibroblast cell state. Through gene regulatory network reconstruction, we found that Hippo-deficient myofibroblasts deployed a network of transcriptional regulators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) consistent with elevated secretory activity. We observed an expansion of myeloid cell heterogeneity in uninjured <i>Lats1/2</i> CKO hearts with similarity to cells recovered from control hearts post-MI.

The zebrafish is an elegant genetic model for the study of hematopoiesis due to its many unique advantages. It has not yet been possible, however, to purify HSCs in adult zebrafish due to a lack of specific HSC markers.

The double-positive fraction of gata2a:GFP and runx1:mCherry (gata2a<sup>+</sup> runx1<sup>+</sup>) was detected at approximately 0.16% in the kidney, the main hematopoietic organ in teleosts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that gata2a<sup>+</sup> runx1<sup>+</sup> cells showed typical molecular signatures of HSCs, including upregulation of gata2b, gfi1aa, runx1t1, pbx1b, and meis1b. Transplantation assays demonstrated that long-term repopulating HSCs were highly enriched within the gata2a<sup>+</sup> runx1<sup>+</sup> fraction.

We find that FACT interacts directly with cohesin, and is dynamically required for its localization on chromatin. Depletion of FACT in metaphase cells prevents cohesin accumulation at pericentric regions and causes reduced binding on chromosome arms. Using the Hi-C technique, we show that cohesin-dependent TAD (topological associated domain)-like structures in G1 and metaphase chromosomes are reduced in the absence of FACT. Sister chromatid cohesion is intact in FACT-depleted cells, although chromosome segregation failure is observed.

These cells, which conditionally express a specific miRNA targeting OPN, were used for in vitro studies as well as for a bone metastasis model in nude rats. Changes in whole-genome expression elicited by conditional OPN knockdown and vesicle formation were also analyzed. The alkylphosphocholine erufosine was used for combination therapy. Conditional OPN knockdown caused mild anti-proliferative, but more intensive anti-migratory and anti clonogenic effects, as well as partial and complete remissions of soft tissue and osteolytic lesions. These effects were associated with specific gene and protein expression modulations following miRNA-mediated OPN knockdown. Furthermore, high levels of OPN were detected in vesicles derived from rats harboring breast cancer skeletal metastases.

Among them, we found that HOXB8 was oncogenic and its activation in CRC was driven by SE instead of genetic alteration. We further demonstrated that the master transcription factor MYC preferentially occupied SEs over TEs (typical enhancers) and regulated HOXB8 transcription by binding to the active elements of its SE. HOXB8 silencing induced reversal of transcriptional signatures associated with malignant phenotypes of CRC. Mechanistically, HOXB8 interacted with a key metastasis regulator BACH1 and instigated BACH1-mediated transcriptional cascade by directly occupying and activating BACH1 gene transcription together with BACH1 itself.

Selinexor, an orally bioavailable, reversible inhibitor of the nuclear export protein, exportin 1, is in clinical trials for a range of cancers, including HGG. It inhibits the NF-κB pathway and strongly induces the expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) in preclinical cancer models. We hypothesized that selinexor inhibits NF-κB via upregulation of NGFR. In HGG cells, sensitivity to selinexor correlated with increased induction of cell surface NGFR expression. Knocking down <i>NGFR</i> in HGG cells increased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, stemness markers, and levels of transcriptionally available nuclear NF-κB not bound to IκB-α, while decreasing apoptosis and sensitivity to selinexor. Increasing IκB-α levels in <i>NGFR</i> knockdown cells restored sensitivity to selinexor. Overexpression of NGFR using cDNA reduced levels of free nuclear NF-κB, decreased stemness markers, and increased markers of cellular differentiation. In all HGG lines tested, selinexor decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB at serine 536 (a site associated with increased transcription of proliferative and inflammatory genes). Because resistance to selinexor monotherapy occurred in our <i>in vivo</i> model, we screened selinexor with a panel of FDA-approved anticancer agents. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that inhibits the NF-κB pathway through a different mechanism than selinexor, showed synergy with selinexor against HGG <i>in vitro</i> Our results help elucidate selinexor's mechanism of action and identify NGFR as a potential biomarker of its effect in HGG and in addition suggest a combination therapy strategy for these challenging tumors.","['Glioma', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Transfection']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Parsing', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Selection detection']"

We here combined antiangiogenic and immune checkpoint therapy and demonstrated improved therapeutic efficacy in syngeneic, orthotopic GBM models. We observed that blockade of VEGF, Ang-2, and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) significantly extended survival compared with vascular targeting alone. In the GBM microenvironment, triple therapy increased the numbers of CTLs, which inversely correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells.

431,31597736,"The chromosomal position of each centromere is determined epigenetically and is highly stable, whereas incremental cases have supported the occurrence of centromere repositioning on an evolutionary time scale (evolutionary new centromeres, ENCs), which is thought to be important in speciation. The mechanisms underlying the high stability of centromeres and its functional significance largely remain an enigma. Here, in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, we identify a feedback mechanism: The kinetochore, whose assembly is guided by the centromere, in turn, enforces centromere stability. Upon going through meiosis, specific inner kinetochore mutations induce centromere repositioning-inactivation of the original centromere and formation of a new centromere elsewhere-in 1 of the 3 chromosomes at random. Repositioned centromeres reside asymmetrically in the pericentromeric regions and cells carrying them are competent in mitosis and homozygotic meiosis. However, when cells carrying a repositioned centromere are crossed with those carrying the original centromere, the progeny suffer severe lethality due to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. Thus, repositioned centromeres constitute a reproductive barrier that could initiate genetic divergence between 2 populations with mismatched centromeres, documenting a functional role of ENCs in speciation. Surprisingly, homozygotic repositioned centromeres tend to undergo meiosis in an inverted order-that is, sister chromatids segregate first, and homologous chromosomes separate second-whereas the original centromeres on other chromosomes in the same cell undergo meiosis in the canonical order, revealing hidden flexibility in the perceived rigid process of meiosis.","['Centromere', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Kinetochores', 'Meiosis', 'Mitosis', 'Schizosaccharomyces', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins']","['RNA central ID', 'Concentration', 'Phylogenetic inference (data centric)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Kinetic model', 'CpG island and isochores', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Mitochondria', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein']"
432,31605540,"Mutant KRAS provides a driving force for enhancement of cancer stem cells (CSCs) characteristics contributing transformation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells harboring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations. Here, we identified the factors mediating the promotion of CSCs properties induced by KRAS mutation through microarray analyses of genes specifically induced in CRC spheroids harboring both KRAS and APC mutations. Among them, REG4 was identified as a key factor since CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of REG4 most significantly affected the stem cell characteristics in which CSCs markers were effectively suppressed. We show that REG4 mediates promotion of CSCs properties via Wnt/β-catenin signaling in various in vitro studies including tumor organoid systems. Furthermore, expression patterns of CSCs markers and REG4 correlated in intestinal tumors from Apc<sup>min/+</sup> /Kras<sup>G12D</sup> LA2 mice and in CRC patient tissues harboring both KRAS and APC mutations. The role of REG4 in the tumor-initiating capacity accompanied by enhancement of CSCs characteristics was also revealed by NSG mice xenograft system.

We used this pipeline to analyze cortical transcripts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients.

434,31630170,"The DUX4 transcription factor is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo and regulates genes involved in embryonic genome activation. Misexpression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, however, is toxic and causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We recently showed DUX4-induced toxicity is due, in part, to the activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) response pathway and the accumulation of intranuclear dsRNA foci. Here, we determined the composition of DUX4-induced dsRNAs. We found that a subset of DUX4-induced dsRNAs originate from inverted Alu repeats embedded within the introns of DUX4-induced transcripts and from DUX4-induced dsRNA-forming intergenic transcripts enriched for endogenous retroviruses, Alu and LINE-1 elements. However, these repeat classes were also represented in dsRNAs from cells not expressing DUX4. In contrast, pericentric human satellite II (HSATII) repeats formed a class of dsRNA specific to the DUX4 expressing cells. Further investigation revealed that DUX4 can initiate the bidirectional transcription of normally heterochromatin-silenced HSATII repeats. DUX4-induced HSATII RNAs co-localized with DUX4-induced nuclear dsRNA foci and with intranuclear aggregation of EIF4A3 and ADAR1. Finally, gapmer-mediated knockdown of HSATII transcripts depleted DUX4-induced intranuclear ribonucleoprotein aggregates and decreased DUX4-induced cell death, suggesting that HSATII-formed dsRNAs contribute to DUX4 toxicity.","['Adenosine Deaminase', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Satellite', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Models, Biological', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral', 'Myoblasts', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transcription Factors']","['Kinase name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Microsatellites', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA structure', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
435,31648943,"Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a propionate pathway disorder caused by dysfunction of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a ""toxic inhibition"" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized mitochondria isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than ""toxic inhibition"" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.","['Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria']","['Drug metabolism', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid index ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'Cell cycle', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Enzyme ID', 'Restriction enzyme name', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA methylation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mitochondria']"
436,31672935,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) relies on hyperactivated protein synthesis. Consistently, human and mouse PDAC lose expression of the translational repressor and mTOR target 4E-BP1. Using genome-wide polysome profiling, we here explore mRNAs whose translational efficiencies depend on the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis in pancreatic cancer cells. We identified a functional enrichment for mRNAs encoding DNA replication and repair proteins, including RRM2 and CDC6. Consequently, 4E-BP1 depletion favors DNA repair and renders DNA replication insensitive to mTOR inhibitors, in correlation with a sustained protein expression of CDC6 and RRM2, which is inversely correlated with 4E-BP1 expression in PDAC patient samples. DNA damage and pancreatic lesions induced by an experimental pancreatitis model uncover that 4E-BP1/2-deleted mice display an increased acinar cell proliferation and a better recovery than WT animals. Targeting translation, independently of 4E-BP1 status, using eIF4A RNA helicase inhibitors (silvestrol derivatives) selectively modulates translation and limits CDC6 expression and DNA replication, leading to reduced PDAC tumor growth. In summary, 4E-BP1 expression loss during PDAC development induces selective changes in translation of mRNA encoding DNA replication and repair protein. Importantly, targeting protein synthesis by eIF4A inhibitors circumvents PDAC resistance to mTOR inhibition.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Replication', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'DNA', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Kinase name']"
437,31672943,"Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed ""autophagy""). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal lipid metabolism. Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal acid lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal lipid metabolism to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.","['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Ventricular Dysfunction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Author ID', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular docking', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'GO (molecular function)', 'Protein function prediction']"
438,31679929,"Centromeres are rapidly evolving across eukaryotes, despite performing a conserved function to ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation. CENP-A chromatin is a hallmark of a functional centromere in most organisms. Due to its critical role in kinetochore architecture, the loss of CENP-A is tolerated in only a few organisms, many of which possess holocentric chromosomes. Here, we characterize the consequence of the loss of CENP-A in the fungal kingdom. Mucor circinelloides, an opportunistic human pathogen, lacks CENP-A along with the evolutionarily conserved CENP-C but assembles a monocentric chromosome with a localized kinetochore complex throughout the cell cycle. Mis12 and Dsn1, two conserved kinetochore proteins, were found to co-localize to a short region, one in each of nine large scaffolds, composed of an ∼200-bp AT-rich sequence followed by a centromere-specific conserved motif that echoes the structure of budding yeast point centromeres. Resembling fungal regional centromeres, these core centromere regions are embedded in large genomic expanses devoid of genes yet marked by Grem-LINE1s, a novel retrotransposable element silenced by the Dicer-dependent RNAi pathway. Our results suggest that these hybrid features of point and regional centromeres arose from the absence of CENP-A, thus defining novel mosaic centromeres in this early-diverging fungus.","['Centromere', 'Centromere Protein A', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Histones', 'Kinetochores', 'Mucor']","['RNA central ID', 'Concentration', 'Phylogenetic inference (data centric)', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'pure protein', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Histogram', 'Kinetic model', 'CpG island and isochores', 'Enzyme kinetics data']"
439,31695196,"Central to understanding cellular behaviour in multi-cellular organisms is the question of how a cell exits one transcriptional state to adopt and eventually become committed to another. Fibroblast growth factor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (FGF -ERK) signalling drives differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and pre-implantation embryos towards primitive endoderm, and inhibiting ERK supports ES cell self-renewal<sup>1</sup>. Paracrine FGF-ERK signalling induces heterogeneity, whereby cells reversibly progress from pluripotency towards primitive endoderm while retaining their capacity to re-enter self-renewal<sup>2</sup>. Here we find that ERK reversibly regulates transcription in ES cells by directly affecting enhancer activity without requiring a change in transcription factor binding. ERK triggers the reversible association and disassociation of RNA polymerase II and associated co-factors from genes and enhancers with the mediator component MED24 having an essential role in ERK-dependent transcriptional regulation. Though the binding of mediator components responds directly to signalling, the persistent binding of pluripotency factors to both induced and repressed genes marks them for activation and/or reactivation in response to fluctuations in ERK activity. Among the repressed genes are several core components of the pluripotency network that act to drive their own expression and maintain the ES cell state; if their binding is lost, the ability to reactivate transcription is compromised. Thus, as long as transcription factor occupancy is maintained, so is plasticity, enabling cells to distinguish between transient and sustained signals. If ERK signalling persists, pluripotency transcription factor levels are reduced by protein turnover and irreversible gene silencing and commitment can occur.","['Animals', 'Cell Lineage', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Mediator Complex', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Complementary medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

EMC-D virus-induced cell death occurred more frequently in DBA/2 β-cells than in B6 β-cells with 100U/ml IFN-β priming in vitro. We therefore purified β-cells using flow cytometry from mice two days after EMC-D virus infection and subjected them to microarray analysis. As a results, innate immune response pathway was found to be enriched in B6 β-cells. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (Stat2) gene interacted with genes in the pathway. Stat2 gene expression levels were lower in DBA/2 mice than in B6 mice, restrictive to β-cells. Moreover, administration of IFN-β failed to upregulate Stat2 gene in DBA/2 β-cells than in those of B6 in vivo. The viral titer significantly increased only in the DBA/2 pancreas.

Longer 3'-DNA overhangs progressively decreased the template-switching rate, even when complementary to the 3' end of the acceptor template. The reliance on only a single bp with the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor together with discrimination against mismatches and the high processivity of group II intron RTs enable synthesis of full-length DNA copies of nucleic acids beginning directly at their 3' end.

INDIGO-MTB further predicted the gene Rv1353c as a key transcriptional regulator of multiple drug interactions, and we confirmed experimentally that Rv1353c upregulation reduces the antagonism of the bedaquiline-streptomycin combination. A retrospective analysis of 57 clinical trials of TB regimens using INDIGO-MTB revealed that synergistic combinations were significantly more efficacious than antagonistic combinations (<i>P</i> value = 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) based on the percentage of patients with negative sputum cultures after 8 weeks of treatment.

RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to confirm the transcriptomic data. Moreover, similar gene alterations were found when Bhas 42 cells were treated with two other transforming SAS. In conclusion, the results obtained in the current study highlight a 12-gene signature that could be considered as a potential early ""bio-marker"" of cell transformation induced by SAS and perhaps other chemicals.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Article', 'Article ID', 'Article format', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
446,31740503,"The marine microalgae <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> (CCMP1779) is a prolific producer of oil and is considered a viable and sustainable resource for biofuel feedstocks. Nitrogen (N) availability has a strong impact on the physiological status and metabolism of microalgal cells, but the exact nature of this response is poorly understood. To fill this gap we performed transcriptomic profiling combined with cellular and molecular analyses of <i>N. oceanica</i> CCMP1779 during the transition from quiescence to autotrophy. N deprivation-induced quiescence was accompanied by a strong reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus and changes in the lipid homeostasis, leading to accumulation of triacylglycerol. Cell cycle activation and re-establishment of photosynthetic activity observed in response to resupply of the growth medium with N were accompanied by a rapid degradation of triacylglycerol stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Besides observing LD translocation into vacuoles, we also provide evidence for direct interaction between the LD surface protein (<i>No</i>LDSP) and AUTOPHAGY-RELATED8 (<i>No</i>ATG8) protein and show a role of microlipophagy in LD turnover in <i>N. oceanica</i> CCMP1779.

To improve our understanding of cryptic transcription, we investigated their transcription start site (TSS) usage, chromatin organization, and posttranscriptional consequences in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> We show that TSSs of chromatin-sensitive internal cryptic transcripts retain comparable features of canonical TSSs in terms of DNA sequence, directionality, and chromatin accessibility. We define the 5' and 3' boundaries of cryptic transcripts and show that, contrary to RNA degradation-sensitive ones, they often overlap with the end of the gene, thereby using the canonical polyadenylation site, and associate to polyribosomes. We show that chromatin-sensitive cryptic transcripts can be recognized by ribosomes and may produce truncated polypeptides from downstream, in-frame start codons. Finally, we confirm the presence of the predicted polypeptides by reanalyzing N-terminal proteomic data sets. Our work suggests that a fraction of chromatin-sensitive internal cryptic promoters initiates the transcription of alternative truncated mRNA isoforms. The expression of these chromatin-sensitive isoforms is conserved from yeast to human, expanding the functional consequences of cryptic transcription and proteome complexity.","['Chromatin', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Fungal', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Initiation Site']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein sequences', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

To dissect the molecular cues from cancer cell-microenvironment interaction that drive metastatic cascade, bone metastatic PCa cells were intravenously implanted into zebrafish embryos and mice tibia forming metastatic lesions. Transcriptomic analysis showed an elevated expression of stemness genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β family member Activin A in the cancer cells at metastatic onset in both animal models. Consistently, analysis of clinical datasets revealed that the expression of Activin A is specifically elevated in metastases and correlates with poor prognosis in stratified high-risk PCa patients. It is further unveiled that the microenvironment induced Activin A expression by NF-κB activation. The elevated level of Activin A enhanced the invasive ALDH<sup>hi</sup> CSC-like phenotypes and PCa proliferation by activation of Smad and ERK1/2 signaling driving metastasis. Suppression of Activin A or Activin receptor significantly reduced the CSC-like subpopulation, invasion, metastatic growth, and bone lesion formation in zebrafish and mice xenografts, suggesting a functional role of NF-κB-dependent Activin A in PCa metastasis. Overall, our study demonstrates that human PCa cells can display a comparable response with the microenvironment in zebrafish and mice xenografts. Combining both animal models, we uncovered the microenvironment-dependent activin signaling as an essential driver in PCa metastasis with therapeutic potential.","['Activins', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zebrafish']","['Proteins', 'Active site prediction', 'Protein active sites', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'R markdown', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'protein', 'Kinase name', 'Epistasis', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein domains', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Fish']"

Using gene knock-down we show that G3P is essential for strain-specific exclusion of non-desirable root-nodulating bacteria and the associated foliar pathogen immunity in soybean. Grafting studies show that while recognition of rhizobium incompatibility is root driven, bacterial exclusion requires G3P biosynthesis in the shoot.

FFAR4 agonists and ω-3 fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, trigger mitosis and adipogenesis by rapidly activating cAMP production inside cilia. Ciliary cAMP activates EPAC signaling, CTCF-dependent chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional activation of PPARγ and CEBPα to initiate adipogenesis.

Hhex expression was repressed in Treg cells by TGF-β/Smad3 signaling. Retroviral overexpression of Hhex inhibited the differentiation of induced Treg (iTreg) cells and the stability of thymic Treg (tTreg) cells by significantly reducing Foxp3 expression. Moreover, Hhex-overexpressing Treg cells lost their immunosuppressive activity and failed to prevent colitis in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). <i>Hhex</i> expression was increased; however, <i>Foxp3</i> expression was decreased in Treg cells in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, a type I immune reaction. Hhex directly bound to the promoters of <i>Foxp3</i> and other Treg signature genes, including <i>Il2ra</i> and <i>Ctla4</i>, and repressed their transactivation.

Enforced Myc expression in TEC induces the prolonged maintenance of a fetal-specific transcriptional program, which in turn extends the growth phase of the thymus and enhances thymic output; meanwhile, inducible expression of Myc in adult TEC similarly promotes thymic growth.

The clinical cohort consisted of 58 patients with histologically diagnosed pineoblastoma (SJMB03 = 30, SJYC07 = 12, non-protocol = 16, including 12 managed with SJMB03-like therapy). The SJMB03 protocol comprised risk-adapted CSI (average-risk = 23.4 Gy, high-risk = 36 Gy) with radiation boost to the primary site and adjuvant chemotherapy. The SJYC07 protocol consisted of induction chemotherapy, consolidation with focal radiation (intermediate-risk) or chemotherapy (high-risk), and metronomic maintenance therapy.

459,31826988,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genes are transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Expression of viral immediate early (α) genes is followed sequentially by early (β), late (γ<sub>1</sub>), and true late (γ<sub>2</sub>) genes. We used precision nuclear run-on with deep sequencing to map and to quantify Pol II on the HSV-1(F) genome with single-nucleotide resolution. Approximately 30% of total Pol II relocated to viral genomes within 3 h postinfection (hpi), when it occupied genes of all temporal classes. At that time, Pol II on α genes accumulated most heavily at promoter-proximal pause (PPP) sites located ∼60 nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site, while β genes bore Pol II more evenly across gene bodies. At 6 hpi, Pol II increased on γ<sub>1</sub> and γ<sub>2</sub> genes while Pol II pausing remained prominent on α genes. At that time, average cytoplasmic mRNA expression from α and β genes decreased, relative to levels at 3 hpi, while γ<sub>1</sub> relative expression increased slightly and γ<sub>2</sub> expression increased more substantially. Cycloheximide treatment during the first 3 h reduced the amount of Pol II associated with the viral genome and confined most of the remaining Pol II to α gene PPP sites. Inhibition of both cyclin-dependent kinase 9 activity and viral DNA replication reduced Pol II on the viral genome and restricted much of the remaining Pol II to PPP sites.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> These data suggest that viral transcription is regulated not only by Pol II recruitment to viral genes but also by control of elongation into viral gene bodies. We provide a detailed map of Pol II occupancy on the HSV-1 genome that clarifies features of the viral transcriptome, including the first identification of Pol II PPP sites. The data indicate that Pol II is recruited to late genes early in infection. Comparing α and β gene occupancy at PPP sites and gene bodies suggests that Pol II is released more efficiently into the bodies of β genes than α genes at 3 hpi and that repression of α gene expression late in infection is mediated by prolonged promoter-proximal pausing. In addition, DNA replication is required to maintain full Pol II occupancy on viral DNA and to promote elongation on late genes later in infection.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Kinase name', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Sequence features', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Virus annotation', 'Virus identifier']"

Although GCN2 is a putative therapeutic target for immuno-oncology, its role in shaping the immune response to tumors is poorly understood. Here, we used mass cytometry, transcriptomics, and transcription factor-binding analysis to determine the functional impact of GCN2 on the myeloid phenotype and immune responses in melanoma. We found that myeloid-lineage deletion of GCN2 drives a shift in the phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that promotes antitumor immunity. Time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing showed that this was due to changes in the immune microenvironment with increased proinflammatory activation of macrophages and MDSCs and interferon-γ expression in intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Mechanistically, GCN2 altered myeloid function by promoting increased translation of the transcription factor CREB-2/ATF4, which was required for maturation and polarization of macrophages and MDSCs in both mice and humans, whereas targeting <i>Atf4</i> by small interfering RNA knockdown reduced tumor growth.

461,31837995,"In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reorganization during oocyte development. However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs. These data reveal a critical role of Polycomb in regulating chromatin architecture during mammalian oocyte growth and early development.","['Animals', 'Blastocyst', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Code', 'Mice', 'Oocytes', 'Oogenesis', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST results', 'BLAST sequence alignment type', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Gene ID', 'CATH node ID', 'Genetic code', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'geneseq', 'HET group name', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Reciprocally, starved SIRT6 transgenic mice show increased pyruvate, acetylcarnitine, and glycerol levels and significantly induce β-oxidation genes in a PPARα-dependent manner. Furthermore, SIRT6 mediates PPARα inhibition of SREBP-dependent cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. Mechanistically, SIRT6 binds PPARα coactivator NCOA2 and decreases liver NCOA2 K780 acetylation, which stimulates its activation of PPARα in a SIRT6-dependent manner.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental switch, we have conducted deep sequencing of the 3D genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of fetal and adult HSCs in mouse. We find that chromosomal compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) are largely conserved between fetal and adult HSCs. However, there is a global trend of increased compartmentalization and TAD boundary strength in adult HSCs. In contrast, intra-TAD chromatin interactions are much more dynamic and widespread, involving over a thousand gene promoters and distal enhancers. These developmental-stage-specific enhancer-promoter interactions are mediated by different sets of transcription factors, such as TCF3 and MAFB in fetal HSCs, versus NR4A1 and GATA3 in adult HSCs.

467,31857114,"Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture conditions are often used to promote the differentiation of human cells as a prerequisite for the study of organotypic functions and environment-specific cellular responses. Here, we assessed the molecular and functional phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) cultured as 3D multilayered aggregates. Microarray studies revealed that these conditions decrease the expression of genes associated with cell cycle control and DNA replication and cease proliferation of VSMCs. This was accompanied by a lower activity level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 and an increase in autocrine TGFβ/SMAD2/3-mediated signaling - a determinant of VSMC differentiation. However, inhibition of TGFβ signaling did not affect markers of VSMC differentiation such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH11) but stimulated pro-inflammatory NFκB-associated gene expression in the first place while decreasing the protein level of NFKB1/p105 and NFKB2/p100 - inhibitors of NFκB transcriptional activity. Moreover, loss of TGFβ signaling also revived VSMC proliferation in 3D aggregates. In conclusion, assembly of VSMCs in multilayered aggregates alters their transcriptome to translate the cellular organization into a resting phenotype. In this context, TGFβ signaling appears to attenuate cell growth and NFκB-controlled gene expression representing important aspects of VSMC quiescence.","['Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'NF-kappa B', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins', 'Transcriptome', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta']","['Aggregation', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'protein', 'Kinase name', 'Protein active sites', 'Cardiology', 'CHAIN', 'Protein chain', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17.

However, the mechanism by which NTAPP activates these physiological effects is poorly understood. Here, we examined whole genome expression profiles of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), the proliferation of which is induced by NTAPP. NTAPP upregulated the expression of genes for cytokine and growth factor, but downregulated genes in apoptotic pathways. When ASCs were treated with NTAPP in the presence of a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger, the expression of various cytokines and growth factors decreased, suggesting that NO is primarily responsible for the enhanced cytokine and growth factor expression induced by NTAPP. Increased histone deacetyl transferase 1 (HDAC1) and decreased acetylated histone 3 were detected in NTAPP-treated ASCs. Similarly, ASCs pre-treated with HDAC, DNA methylation, or histone methylation inhibitors had reduced expression of cytokines and growth factors after NTAPP treatment. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NTAPP induces epigenetic modifications that activate the expression of cytokines and growth factors, explaining how NTAPP acts as an efficient tool in regenerative medicine to stimulate stem cell proliferation, to activate immune cells, and to recover wounds.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mesoderm', 'Plasma Gases', 'Stem Cells']","['Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'PlasMapper TextMap', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata']"

Studies of different THAP proteins have indicated roles in gene transcription, cell proliferation and development. We have analyzed this protein family, focusing on THAP7 and THAP11. We show that human THAP proteins possess differing homo- and heterodimer formation properties and interaction abilities with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1. HEK-293 cells lacking THAP7 were viable but proliferated more slowly. In contrast, HEK-293 cells were very sensitive to THAP11 alteration. Nevertheless, HEK-293 cells bearing a THAP11 mutation identified in a patient suffering from cobalamin disorder (THAP11F80L) were viable although proliferated more slowly. Cobalamin disorder is an inborn vitamin deficiency characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, most often owing to biallelic mutations in the MMACHC gene, whose gene product MMACHC is a key enzyme in the cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolic pathway. We show that THAP11F80L selectively affected promoter binding by THAP11, having more deleterious effects on a subset of THAP11 targets, and resulting in altered patterns of gene expression. In particular, THAP11F80L exhibited a strong effect on association with the MMACHC promoter and led to a decrease in MMACHC gene transcription, suggesting that the THAP11F80L mutation is directly responsible for the observed cobalamin disorder.","['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Mutation', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Vitamin B 12', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Promoter ID', 'Genetic map', 'Promoter prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'Protein expression', 'protein']"

How Cdkn1c regulates corticogenesis is however not clear. To this end we employ Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) technology to genetically dissect Cdkn1c gene function in corticogenesis at single cell resolution. We find that the previously described growth-inhibitory Cdkn1c function is a non-cell-autonomous one, acting on the whole organism. In contrast we reveal a growth-promoting cell-autonomous Cdkn1c function which at the mechanistic level mediates radial glial progenitor cell and nascent projection neuron survival.

478,31941964,"Wolff's law and the Utah Paradigm of skeletal physiology state that bone architecture adapts to mechanical loads. These models predict the existence of a mechanostat that links strain induced by mechanical forces to skeletal remodeling. However, how the mechanostat influences bone remodeling remains elusive. Here, we find that Piezo1 deficiency in osteoblastic cells leads to loss of bone mass and spontaneous fractures with increased bone resorption. Furthermore, Piezo1-deficient mice are resistant to further bone loss and bone resorption induced by hind limb unloading, demonstrating that PIEZO1 can affect osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk in response to mechanical forces. At the mechanistic level, in response to mechanical loads, PIEZO1 in osteoblastic cells controls the YAP-dependent expression of type II and IX collagens. In turn, these collagen isoforms regulate osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data identify PIEZO1 as the major skeletal mechanosensor that tunes bone homeostasis.","['Animals', 'Bone Resorption', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Collagen Type II', 'Collagen Type IX', 'Female', 'Fractures, Bone', 'Hindlimb Suspension', 'Homeostasis', 'Ion Channels', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Osteoporosis', 'Stress, Mechanical']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Gene structure', 'Protein structure', 'Sequence features', 'Epistasis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format']"

480,31961859,"Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues-liver, lung, and kidney-in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.","['Animals', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Kidney', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Quantitative Trait Loci']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Kinase name', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Gene expression QTL analysis']"

Here, we characterize the transcriptome and assembly of P granules, RNA granules in the <i>C. elegans</i> germ plasm. We find that P granules recruit mRNAs by condensation with the disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 traps mRNAs into non-dynamic condensates in vitro and binds to ~500 mRNAs in vivo in a sequence-independent manner that favors embryonic mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. Localization to P granules is not required for translational repression but is required to enrich mRNAs in the germ lineage for robust germline development. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify intrinsically-disordered proteins as drivers of RNA condensation during P granule assembly.","['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Germ Cells', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'protein', 'Plasmid map', 'cel', 'Keyword', 'CellML', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
482,31993211,"<i>Candida glabrata</i> is an important human fungal pathogen known to trigger serious infections in immune-compromised individuals. Its ability to form biofilms, which exhibit high tolerance to antifungal treatments, has been considered as an important virulence factor. However, the mechanisms involving antifungal resistance in biofilms and the impact of host niche environments on these processes are still poorly defined. In this study, we performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of <i>C. glabrata</i> biofilm cells exposed to different environmental conditions and constraints in order to identify the molecular pathways involved in fluconazole resistance and understand how acidic pH niches, associated with the presence of acetic acid, are able to modulate these responses. We show that fluconazole treatment induces gene expression reprogramming in a carbon source and pH-dependent manner. This is particularly relevant for a set of genes involved in DNA replication, ergosterol, and ubiquinone biosynthesis. We also provide additional evidence that the loss of mitochondrial function is associated with fluconazole resistance, independently of the growth condition. Lastly, we propose that <i>C. glabrata</i> Mge1, a cochaperone involved in iron metabolism and protein import into the mitochondria, is a key regulator of fluconazole susceptibility during carbon and pH adaptation by reducing the metabolic flux towards toxic sterol formation. These new findings suggest that different host microenvironments influence directly the physiology of <i>C. glabrata</i>, with implications on how this pathogen responds to antifungal treatment.

483,31999790,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a chronic condition, where viral DNA integrates into the genome. Latently infected cells form a persistent, heterogeneous reservoir that at any time can reactivate the integrated HIV-1. Here we confirmed that latently infected cells from HIV-1 positive study participants exhibited active HIV-1 transcription but without production of mature spliced mRNAs. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this we employed primary HIV-1 latency models to study latency establishment and maintenance. We characterized proviral transcription and chromatin development in cultures of resting primary CD4+ T-cells for four months after ex vivo HIV-1 infection. As heterochromatin (marked with H3K9me3 or H3K27me3) gradually stabilized, the provirus became less accessible with reduced activation potential. In a subset of infected cells, active marks (e.g. H3K27ac) and elongating RNAPII remained detectable at the latent provirus, despite prolonged proviral silencing. In many aspects, latent HIV-1 resembled an active enhancer in a subset of resting cells. The enhancer chromatin actively promoted latency and the enhancer-specific CBP/P300-inhibitor GNE049 was identified as a new latency reversal agent. The division of the latent reservoir according to distinct chromatin compositions with different reactivation potential enforces the notion that even though a relatively large set of cells contains the HIV-1 provirus, only a discrete subset is readily able to reactivate the provirus and spread the infection.","['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Chromatin', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Proviruses', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Latency']","['Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Protein interactions', 'HIVDB identifier', 'HIVDB entry format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein databases', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'latex']"

Similarly, lncRNAs are lost in diabetic humans. LncRNA promoter analyses, global cistrome and gain-of-function analyses confirm that increased MAFG signaling during DIO curbs lncRNA expression.

Hsp47 expression induced mesenchymal phenotypes in mammary epithelial cells (MECs), enhanced platelet recruitment, and promoted lung retention and colonization of cancer cells. Platelet depletion in vivo abolished Hsp47-induced cancer cell retention in the lung, suggesting that Hsp47 promotes cancer cell colonization by enhancing cancer cell-platelet interaction. Using rescue experiments and functional blocking antibodies, we identified type I collagen as the key mediator of Hsp47-induced cancer cell-platelet interaction. We also found that Hsp47-dependent collagen deposition and platelet recruitment facilitated cancer cell clustering and extravasation in vitro. By analyzing DNA/RNA sequencing data generated from human breast cancer tissues, we showed that gene amplification and increased expression of Hsp47 were associated with cancer metastasis.

Strategies to normalize the tumor vasculature are therefore of significant therapeutic interest for cancer treatments. VEGF inhibitors are used clinically to normalize tumor blood vessels. However, the time frame and dosage of these inhibitors required to achieve normalization is rather narrow, and there is a need to identify additional signaling targets to attain vascular normalization. In addition to VEGF, the endothelial-specific receptor Alk1 plays a critical role in vascular development and promotes vascular remodeling and maturation. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of the Alk1 ligand BMP9 on tumor vascular formation. BMP9 overexpression in Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors significantly delayed tumor growth. Blood vessels in BMP9-overexpressing LLC tumors displayed markers of vascular maturation and were characterized by increased perivascular cell coverage. Tumor vasculature normalization was associated with decreased permeability and increased perfusion. These changes in vascular function in BMP9-overexpressing LLC tumors resulted in significant alterations of the tumor microenvironment, characterized by a decrease in hypoxia and an increase in immune infiltration. In conclusion, we show that BMP9 promotes vascular normalization in LLC tumors that leads to changes in the microenvironment.","['Activin Receptors, Type I', 'Animals', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Female', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 2', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']","['Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Tumor annotation', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Helical net', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Pathology', 'Forcefield parameterisation', 'Biological pathway map', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways']"

Here we examined the trophoblast potential of isogenic naïve and primed hPSCs. We found that naïve hPSCs can directly give rise to human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and undergo further differentiation into both extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast. In contrast, primed hPSCs do not support hTSC derivation, but give rise to non-self-renewing cytotrophoblasts in response to BMP4. Global transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses indicate that hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs and acquire features of post-implantation trophectoderm.

However, the anti-aging effect of Codonopsis pilosula on the lungs remains largely unknown, and the molecular mechanism also needs to be further studied. Thus, we investigated the protective effect of Codonopsis pilosula on the lungs of aging mice, and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS We established an aging mouse model and then treated the mice with Codonopsis pilosula. Microarray analysis and bioinformatics methods were used to comprehensively analyze the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) network. RESULTS Our results showed that we successfully established the aging mouse model. The microarray analysis showed that 138 lncRNAs, 128 mRNAs, and 7 miRNAs were significantly changed after aging, and 282 lncRNAs, 283 mRNAs, and 19 miRNAs were dysregulated after treatment with Codonopsis pilosula. To explore the signaling pathways involved, KEGG pathway analysis was performed. Compared with the ceRNA network in aging mice and after treatment with Codonopsis pilosula, we found that 3 mRNAs (Hif3a, Zbtb16, Plxna2) and 1 lncRNA (NONMMUT063872) were associated with the anti-aging effect of Codonopsis pilosula and they were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis.

491,32075560,"The plant-specific RNA Polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcribes heterochromatic regions, including many transposable elements (TEs), with the well-described role of generating 24 nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

In the male gametophytic phase of the plant life cycle, pollen, Pol IV switches to generating primarily 21-22 nt siRNAs, but the biogenesis and function of these siRNAs have been enigmatic. In contrast to being pollen-specific, we identified that Pol IV generates these 21-22 nt siRNAs in sporophytic tissues, likely from the same transcripts that are processed into the more abundant 24 nt siRNAs. The 21-22 nt forms are specifically generated by the combined activities of DICER proteins DCL2/DCL4 and can participate in RNA-directed DNA methylation. These 21-22 nt siRNAs are also loaded into ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), which is known to function in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Like other plant siRNAs and microRNAs incorporated into AGO1, we find a signature of genic mRNA cleavage at the predicted target site of these siRNAs, suggesting that Pol IV-generated 21-22 nt siRNAs may function to regulate gene transcript abundance.

By monitoring dual reporter fluorescence during pluripotency entry, we identify a sequential order of Tet1 and Oct4 activation by proximal and distal regulatory elements. Full Tet1 activation marks an intermediate stage that accompanies predominantly repression of somatic genes, preceding full Oct4 activation, and distinguishes two waves of global DNA demethylation that target distinct genomic features but are uncoupled from transcriptional changes. Tet1 knockout shows that TET1 contributes to both waves of demethylation and activates germline regulatory genes in reprogramming intermediates but is dispensable for Oct4 reactivation.

494,32080242,"Crop pollination by the western honey bee Apis mellifera is vital to agriculture but threatened by alarmingly high levels of colony mortality, especially in Europe and North America. Colony loss is due, in part, to the high viral loads of Deformed wing virus (DWV), transmitted by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, especially throughout the overwintering period of a honey bee colony. Covert DWV infection is commonplace and has been causally linked to precocious foraging, which itself has been linked to colony loss. Taking advantage of four brain transcriptome studies that unexpectedly revealed evidence of covert DWV-A infection, we set out to explore whether this effect is due to DWV-A mimicking naturally occurring changes in brain gene expression that are associated with behavioral maturation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that brain gene expression profiles of DWV-A infected bees resembled those of foragers, even in individuals that were much younger than typical foragers. In addition, brain transcriptional regulatory network analysis revealed a positive association between DWV-A infection and transcription factors previously associated with honey bee foraging behavior. Surprisingly, single-cell RNA-Sequencing implicated glia, not neurons, in this effect; there are relatively few glial cells in the insect brain and they are rarely associated with behavioral plasticity. Covert DWV-A infection also has been linked to impaired learning, which together with precocious foraging can lead to increased occurrence of infected bees from one colony mistakenly entering another colony, especially under crowded modern apiary conditions.

When RABV invaded from the periphery, TLR7 detected viral single-stranded RNA and triggered immune responses that limited the virus's entry into the central nervous system (CNS). When RABV had invaded the CNS, its detection by TLR7 led to the production of cytokines and chemokines and an increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, peripheral immune cells, including pDCs, macrophages, neutrophils, and B cells infiltrated the CNS. While this immune response, triggered by TLR7, helped to clear viruses, it also increased neuroinflammation and caused immunopathology in the mouse brain. Our results demonstrate that TLR7 is an innate recognition receptor for RABV, which restricts RABV invasion into the CNS in the early stage of viral infection but also contributes to immunopathology by inducing neuroinflammation.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Developing targeted treatment for RABV requires understanding the innate immune response to the virus because early virus clearance is essential for preventing the fatality when the infection has progressed to the CNS. Previous studies have revealed that TLR7 is involved in the immune response to RABV. Here, we establish that TLR7 recognizes RABV and facilitates the production of some interferon-stimulated genes. We also demonstrated that when RABV invades into the CNS, TLR7 enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines which contribute to immunopathology in the mouse brain. Taken together, our findings suggest that treatments for RABV must consider the balance between the beneficial and harmful effects of TLR7-triggered immune responses.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain', 'Chemokines', 'Cytokines', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Permeability', 'Rabies', 'Rabies virus', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Strain identifier', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'cel', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Nucleic acid probability profile', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation']"
496,32113985,"In the nucleus, chromosomes are hierarchically folded into active (A) and inactive (B) compartments composed of topologically associating domains (TADs). Genomic regions interact with nuclear lamina, termed lamina-associated domains (LADs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 3D chromatin architectures remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of a potential tumor suppressor, TOP1 Binding Arginine/Serine Rich Protein (TOPORS), in genome organization. In mouse hepatocytes, chromatin interactions between A and B compartments increase and compartmentalization strength is reduced significantly upon Topors knockdown. Correspondingly, strength of TAD boundaries located at A/B borders is weakened. In the absence of TOPORS, chromatin-lamina interactions decrease and the coverage of LADs reduces from 53.31% to 46.52%. Interestingly, these changes in 3D genome are associated with PML nuclear bodies and PML-associated domains (PADs). Moreover, chromatin accessibility is altered predominantly at intergenic regions upon Topors knockdown, including a subset of enhancers. These alterations of chromatin are concordant with transcriptome changes, which are associated with carcinogenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TOPORS functions as a regulator in chromatin structure, providing novel insight into the architectural roles of tumor suppressors in higher-order genome organization.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcriptome', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'MRI', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid data', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein property', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences']"

Whether and how individual tRNA genes are specifically regulated is not clear. Here, we report that SOX4, a well-known Pol II-dependent transcription factor that is critical for neurogenesis and reprogramming of somatic cells, also directly controls, unexpectedly, the expression of a subset of tRNA genes and therefore protein synthesis and proliferation of human glioblastoma cells. Genome-wide location analysis through chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing uncovers specific targeting of SOX4 to a subset of tRNA genes, including those for <i>tRNAi<sup>Met</sup></i> Mechanistically, sequence-specific SOX4-binding impedes the recruitment of TATA box binding protein and Pol III to tRNA genes and thereby represses their expression.

IL-2 drives terminal differentiation, generating cells that are poorly effective against tumors, whereas IL-21 promotes stem cell memory T cells (T<sub>SCM</sub>) and antitumor responses. Here we investigated the role of metabolic programming in the developmental differences induced by these cytokines. IL-2 promoted effector-like metabolism and aerobic glycolysis, robustly inducing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lactate production, whereas IL-21 maintained a metabolically quiescent state dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. LDH inhibition rewired IL-2-induced effects, promoting pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and inhibiting terminal effector and exhaustion programs, including mRNA expression of members of the NR4A family of nuclear receptors, as well as <i>Prdm1</i> and <i>Xbp1</i> While deletion of <i>Ldha</i> prevented development of cells with antitumor effector function, transient LDH inhibition enhanced the generation of memory cells capable of triggering robust antitumor responses after adoptive transfer. LDH inhibition did not significantly affect IL-21-induced metabolism but caused major transcriptomic changes, including the suppression of IL-21-induced exhaustion markers LAG3, PD1, 2B4, and TIM3. LDH inhibition combined with IL-21 increased the formation of T<sub>SCM</sub> cells, resulting in more profound antitumor responses and prolonged host survival.

Here, we provide insight into how these responses are connected by the finding that ubiquitylation of RNAPII itself, at a single lysine (RPB1 K<sub>1268</sub>), is the focal point for DNA-damage-response coordination. K<sub>1268</sub> ubiquitylation affects DNA repair and signals RNAPII degradation, essential for surviving genotoxic insult. RNAPII degradation results in a shutdown of transcriptional initiation, in the absence of which cells display dramatic transcriptome alterations. Additionally, regulation of RNAPII stability is central to transcription recovery-persistent RNAPII depletion underlies the failure of this process in Cockayne syndrome B cells.

Dynamic transcriptional control by DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and DNA demethylation, achieved by ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent mechanisms, is proposed to regulate synaptic function in the adult brain with implications for learning and memory. However, focus so far is laid on excitatory neurons. Given the crucial role of inhibitory cortical interneurons in cortical information processing and in disease, deciphering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of GABAergic transmission is fundamental. The emerging relevance of DNMT and TET-mediated functions for synaptic regulation irrevocably raises the question for the targeted subcellular processes and mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the role dynamic DNA methylation has in regulating cortical interneuron function. We found that DNMT1 and TET1/TET3 contrarily modulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, we provide evidence that DNMT1 influences synaptic vesicle replenishment and GABAergic transmission, presumably through the DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional control over endocytosis-related genes.

This resulted in enhanced formation of TonEBP/NF-κB p65 complexes and enhanced proinflammatory gene expression.

However, the pathogenesis of HTNV infection remains elusive. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of non-coding RNAs, play a crucial role in various pathogenic processes. Nevertheless, circRNA expression profiles and their effects on pathogenesis of HTNV infection are still completely unknown. In the present study, RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the circRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA expression profiles in HTNV-infected and mock-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A total of 70 circRNAs, 66 miRNAs, and 788 mRNAs were differently expressed. Several differentially expressed RNAs were validated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, we verified that some differentially expressed RNAs, such as circ_0000479, miR-149-5p, miR-330-5p, miR-411-3p, RIG-I, CMPK2, PARP10, and GBP1, promoted or inhibited HTNV replication.

Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was integrally analyzed. The data showed that there were many circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions in HTNV infection. By dual-luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed that circ_0000479 indirectly regulated RIG-I expression by sponging miR-149-5p, hampering viral replication. This study for the first time presents a comprehensive overview of circRNAs induced by HTNV and reveals that a network of enriched circRNAs and circRNA-associated competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) is involved in the regulation of HTNV infection, thus offering new insight into the mechanisms underlying HTNV-host interaction.","['Asia', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Hantaan virus', 'Hantavirus Infections', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Seq']","['Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Infectious disease', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'PCR experiment', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'CD spectra', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
513,32233089,"SUMOylation is a dynamic post-translational protein modification that primarily takes place in cell nuclei, where it plays a key role in multiple DNA-related processes. In neurons, the SUMOylation-dependent control of a subset of neuronal transcription factors is known to regulate various aspects of nerve cell differentiation, development, and function. In an unbiased screen for endogenous SUMOylation targets in the developing mouse brain, based on a His<sub>6</sub> -HA-SUMO1 knock-in mouse line, we previously identified the transcription factor Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 20 (Zbtb20) as a new SUMO1-conjugate. We show here that the three key SUMO paralogues SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3 can all be conjugated to Zbtb20 in vitro in HEK293FT cells, and we confirm the SUMOylation of Zbtb20 in vivo in mouse brain. Using primary hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Zbtb20 knock-out (KO) mice as a model system, we then demonstrate that the expression of Zbtb20 is required for proper nerve cell development and neurite growth and branching. Furthermore, we show that the SUMOylation of Zbtb20 is essential for its function in this context, and provide evidence indicating that SUMOylation affects the Zbtb20-dependent transcriptional profile of neurons. Our data highlight the role of SUMOylation in the regulation of neuronal transcription factors that determine nerve cell development, and they demonstrate that key functions of the transcription factor Zbtb20 in neuronal development and neurite growth are under obligatory SUMOylation control.","['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hippocampus', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nervous System', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Immunogenetics', 'Neurite measurement', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Following that, NSCs have a major switch in their progenitor properties and produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons for the olfactory bulb (OB), cortical oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2<sup>+</sup>) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2<sup>+</sup> IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population.

Along with their directional tuning, neurons of each T4/T5 subtype orient their dendrites and project their axons in a subtype-specific manner. Directional tuning, thus, appears strictly linked to morphology in T4/T5 neurons. How the four T4/T5 subtypes acquire their distinct morphologies during development remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated when and how the dendrites of the four T4/T5 subtypes acquire their specific orientations, and profiled the transcriptomes of all T4/T5 neurons during this process. This revealed a simple and stable combinatorial code of transcription factors defining the four T4/T5 subtypes during their development. Changing the combination of transcription factors of specific T4/T5 subtypes resulted in predictable and complete conversions of subtype-specific properties, i.e. dendrite orientation and matching axon projection pattern. Therefore, a combinatorial code of transcription factors coordinates the development of dendrite and axon morphologies to generate anatomical specializations that differentiate subtypes of T4/T5 motion-sensing neurons.","['Animals', 'Dendrites', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Motion Perception', 'Neurons', 'Sensory Receptor Cells', 'Transcription Factors', 'Visual Pathways']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Dendrogram visualisation', 'Protein sites and features', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Peptide annotation', 'Reaction data', 'Operation', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Pathway visualisation', 'Pathway or network', 'Pathway ID (WikiPathways)']"

We find that the ground state ESCs cultured with GSK3-, MEK-inhibitors and LIF (2iL) display higher ribosome density on a selective set of mRNAs. This set of mRNAs undergo strong translational buffering to maintain stable protein expression levels in 2iL-ESCs. Importantly, we show that the global alteration of cellular proteome during the transition of naïve-to-primed pluripotency is largely accompanied by transcriptional rewiring.

519,32249388,"During development, gene expression is spatiotemporally regulated by long-distance chromatin interactions between distal enhancers and target promoters. However, how specificity of the interactions between enhancers and promoters is achieved remains largely unknown. As there are far more enhancers than promoters in mammalian genomes, the complexities of enhancer choice during gene regulation remain obscure. CTCF, the CCCTC-binding factor that directionally binds to a vast range of genomic sites known as CBSs (CTCF-binding sites), mediates oriented chromatin looping between a substantial set of distal enhancers and target promoters. To investigate mechanisms by which CTCF engages in enhancer choice, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based DNA-fragment editing to duplicate CBS-containing enhancers and promoters in the native genomic locus of the clustered Pcdhα genes. We found that the promoter is regulated by the proximal one among duplicated enhancers and that this choice is dependent on CTCF-mediated directional enhancer-promoter looping. In addition, gene expression is unaltered upon the switch of enhancers. Moreover, after promoter duplication, only the proximal promoter is chosen by CTCF-mediated directional chromatin looping to contact with the distal enhancer. Finally, we demonstrated that both enhancer activation and chromatin looping with the promoter are essential for gene expression. These findings have important implications regarding the role of CTCF in specific interactions between enhancers and promoters as well as developmental regulation of gene expression by enhancer switching.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Editing', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Editing', 'Sequence editing', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Phenomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters']"

Although gene-environment interactions have been implicated in the etiology of several disorders, the impact of paternal and/or maternal metabolic syndrome on the clinical phenotypes of offspring and the underlying genetic and epigenetic contributors of NAFLD have not been fully explored. To this end, we used the liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, a unique nondietary model manifesting 3 hallmarks that confer high risk for the development of NAFLD: hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. We report that parental metabolic syndrome epigenetically reprograms members of the TGF-β family, including neuronal regeneration-related protein (NREP) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). NREP and GDF15 modulate the expression of several genes involved in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. In particular, NREP downregulation increases the protein abundance of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) in a TGF-β receptor/PI3K/protein kinase B-dependent manner, to regulate hepatic acetyl-CoA and cholesterol synthesis. Reduced hepatic expression of NREP in patients with NAFLD and substantial correlations between low serum NREP levels and the presence of steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis highlight the clinical translational relevance of our findings in the context of recent preclinical trials implicating ACLY in NAFLD progression.","['Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Metabolic disease', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Variant effect prediction']"

In contrast, exogenous cell permeable itaconate, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated PM-induced inflammation in macrophages. OI was sufficient to activate NRF2 in macrophages; however, NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI.

Analysis of MOB2 expression in glioma patient specimens and bioinformatic analyses of public datasets revealed that MOB2 was downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in GBM. Ectopic MOB2 expression suppressed, while depletion of MOB2 enhanced, the malignant phenotypes of GBM cells, such as clonogenic growth, anoikis resistance, and formation of focal adhesions, migration, and invasion. Moreover, depletion of MOB2 increased, while overexpression of MOB2 decreased, GBM cell metastasis in a chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Overexpression of MOB2-mediated antitumor effects were further confirmed in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, MOB2 negatively regulated the FAK/Akt pathway involving integrin. Notably, MOB2 interacted with and promoted PKA signaling in a cAMP-dependent manner. Furthermore, the cAMP activator Forskolin increased, while the PKA inhibitor H89 decreased, MOB2 expression in GBM cells. Functionally, MOB2 contributed to the cAMP/PKA signaling-regulated inactivation of FAK/Akt pathway and inhibition of GBM cell migration and invasion. Collectively, these findings suggest a role of MOB2 as a tumor suppressor in GBM via regulation of FAK/Akt signaling. Additionally, we uncover MOB2 as a novel regulator in cAMP/PKA signaling.

Previously, we showed that eroded telomeres lead to differentiation instability in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) via DNA hypomethylation at pluripotency-factor promoters. Here, we uncovered that telomerase reverse transcriptase null (<i>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mESCs exhibit genome-wide alterations in chromatin accessibility and gene expression during differentiation. These changes were accompanied by an increase of H3K27me3 globally, an altered chromatin landscape at the <i>Pou5f1/Oct4</i> promoter, and a refractory response to differentiation cues. Inhibition of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), an H3K27 tri-methyltransferase, exacerbated the impairment in differentiation and pluripotency gene repression in <i>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></i> mESCs but not wild-type mESCs, whereas inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylation led to a partial rescue of the <i>Tert<sup>-/-</sup></i> phenotype. These data reveal a new interdependent relationship between H3K27me3 and telomere integrity in stem cell lineage commitment that may have implications in aging and cancer.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones', 'Mice', 'Telomere']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Histogram', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice']"
532,32298266,"miRNAs are an important class of small non-coding RNAs, which play a versatile role in gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in human cancers. We analyzed small RNA massive parallel sequencing data from 50 locally advanced breast cancers aiming to identify novel breast cancer related miRNAs. We successfully predicted 10 novel miRNAs, out of which 2 (hsa-miR-nov3 and hsa-miR-nov7) were recurrent. Applying high sensitivity qPCR, we detected these two microRNAs in 206 and 214 out of 223 patients in the study from which the initial cohort of 50 samples were drawn. We found hsa-miR-nov3 and hsa-miR-nov7 both to be overexpressed in tumor versus normal breast tissue in a separate set of 13 patients (p = 0.009 and p = 0.016, respectively) from whom both tumor tissue and normal tissue were available. We observed hsa-miR-nov3 to be expressed at higher levels in ER-positive compared to ER-negative tumors (p = 0.037). Further stratifications revealed particularly low levels in the her2-like and basal-like cancers compared to other subtypes (p = 0.009 and 0.040, respectively). We predicted target genes for the 2 microRNAs and identified inversely correlated genes in mRNA expression array data available from 203 out of the 223 patients. Applying the KEGG and GO annotations to target genes revealed pathways essential to cell development, communication and homeostasis. Although a weak association between high expression levels of hsa-miR-nov7 and poor survival was observed, this did not reach statistical significance. hsa-miR-nov3 expression levels had no impact on patient survival.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'MicroRNAs', 'Prognosis', 'Up-Regulation']","['BEAST', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Statistical estimate score', 'Copy number estimation', 'Multiple testing correction', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA']"
533,32311160,"Mechanical loading is a potent strategy to induce bone formation, but with aging, the bone formation response to the same mechanical stimulus diminishes. Our main objectives were to (i) discover the potential transcriptional differences and (ii) compare the periosteal cell proliferation between tibias of young-adult and old mice in response to strain-matched mechanical loading. First, to discover potential age-related transcriptional differences, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare the loading responses between tibias of young-adult (5-month) and old (22-month) C57BL/6N female mice following 1, 3, or 5 days of axial loading (loaded versus non-loaded). Compared to young-adult mice, old mice had less transcriptional activation following loading at each time point, as measured by the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the fold-changes of the DEGs. Old mice engaged fewer pathways and gene ontology (GO) processes, showing less activation of processes related to proliferation and differentiation. In tibias of young-adult mice, we observed prominent Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM), and neuronal responses, which were diminished with aging. Additionally, we identified several targets that may be effective in restoring the mechanoresponsiveness of aged bone, including nerve growth factor (NGF), Notum, prostaglandin signaling, Nell-1, and the AP-1 family. Second, to directly test the extent to which periosteal cell proliferation was diminished in old mice, we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in a separate cohort of mice to label cells that divided during the 5-day loading interval. Young-adult and old mice had an average of 15.5 and 16.7 BrdU+ surface cells/mm, respectively, suggesting that impaired proliferation in the first 5 days of loading does not explain the diminished bone formation response with aging. We conclude that old mice have diminished transcriptional activation following mechanical loading, but periosteal proliferation in the first 5 days of loading does not differ between tibias of young-adult and old mice. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteogenesis', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Tibia', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Weight-Bearing']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Proteogenomics', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein fragment weight comparison', 'Protein molecular weight calculation']"

535,32319174,"Transcription factor cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3 like 1 (Creb3l1) is a non-classical endoplasmic reticulum stress molecule that is emerging as an important component for cellular homeostasis, particularly within cell types with high peptide secretory capabilities. We have previously shown that Creb3l1 serves an important role in body fluid homeostasis through its transcriptional control of the gene coding for antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin in the neuropeptide-rich magnocellular neurones of the supraoptic nucleus. In response to osmotic stimuli such as dehydration, vasopressin magnocellular neurones undergo remarkable transcriptome changes, including increased Creb3l1 expression, to ensure that the supply of vasopressin meets demand. To determine where else Creb3l1 fits into the secretory cell supply chain, we performed RNA-sequencing of Creb3l1 knockdown anterior pituitary mouse corticotroph cell line AtT20. The target chosen for further investigation was Pcsk1, which encodes proprotein convertase enzyme 1 (PC1/3). PC1/3 is crucial for processing of neuropeptides and peptide hormones such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proinsulin, proglucagon, vasopressin and oxytocin. Viral manipulations in supraoptic nuclei by over-expression of Creb3l1 increased Pcsk1, whereas Creb3l1 knockdown decreased Pcsk1 expression. In vitro promoter activity and binding studies showed that Creb3l1 was a transcription factor of the Pcsk1 gene binding directly to a G-box motif in the promoter. In the dehydrated rat anterior pituitary, Creb3l1 and Pcsk1 expression decreased in parallel compared to control, supporting our findings from manipulations in AtT20 cells and the supraoptic nucleus. No relationship was observed between Creb3l1 and Pcsk1 expression in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary, indicating a different mechanism of PC1/3 synthesis by these POMC-synthesising cells. Therefore, Creb3l1, by regulating the expression of Pcsk1, does not control the processing of POMC peptides in the intermediate lobe.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin', 'Proprotein Convertase 1', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Supraoptic Nucleus']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'ELAND format', 'protein', 'Protein property', 'Protein properties', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence']"

Early-stage PCa and late-stage PCa are dependent on androgen signaling, and inhibitors of the androgen receptor (AR) axis represent the standard therapy. Here, we studied in detail the global impact of darolutamide, a newly approved AR antagonist, on the transcriptome and AR-bound cistrome in two PCa cell models. Darolutamide strongly depleted the AR from gene regulatory regions and abolished AR-driven transcriptional signaling. Enhancer activation was blocked at the chromatin level as evaluated by H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), and FOXA1, MED1, and BRD4 binding. We identified genomic regions with high affinities for the AR in androgen-stimulated, but also in androgen-depleted conditions. A similar AR affinity pattern was observed in healthy and PCa tissue samples. High FOXA1, BRD4, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 levels were found to mark regions showing AR binding in the hormone-depleted setting. Conversely, low FOXA1, BRD4, and H3K27ac levels were observed at regulatory sites that responded strongly to androgen stimulation, and AR interactions at these sites were blocked by darolutamide. Beside marked loss of AR occupancy, FOXA1 recruitment to chromatin was also clearly reduced after darolutamide treatment. We furthermore identified numerous androgen-regulated super-enhancers (SEs) that were associated with hallmark androgen and cell proliferation-associated gene sets. Importantly, these SEs are also active in PCa tissues and sensitive to darolutamide treatment in our models. Our findings demonstrate that darolutamide is a potent AR antagonist blocking genome-wide AR enhancer and SE activation, and downstream transcription. We also show the existence of a dynamic AR cistrome that depends on the androgen levels and on high AR affinity regions present in PCa cell lines and also in tissue samples.","['Androgens', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Pyrazoles', 'Receptors, Androgen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Pathogens', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Molecules', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
538,32339497,"The biological processes of urothelial carcinogenesis are not fully understood, particularly regarding the relationship between specific genetic events, cell of origin, and molecular subtypes of subsequent tumors. N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)-induced mouse bladder cancer is widely accepted as a useful model that recapitulates the pathway of human bladder tumorigenesis from dysplasia to invasive cancer via carcinoma in situ. However, the long and variable time of tumorigenesis often hinders efficient preclinical or translational research. We hypothesized that Trp53 mutation in specific types of urothelial cells facilitates efficient development of clinically relevant bladder cancer. Using lineage tracing, we showed that Trp53 mutation in Krt5-expressing cells resulted in more efficient tumorigenesis of mouse muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with squamous differentiation compared with Trp53 mutation in Upk2-expressing cells, or wild-type or hemizygous Trp53 in the entire urothelium. Mouse MIBC that developed at 24 weeks of BBN treatment showed morphologic and genetic similarities to the basal squamous subtypes of human MIBC, irrespective of pre-induction of Trp53 mutation or whether the cell of origin was Krt5- or Upk2-expressing cells. Our findings suggest that intermediate cells as well as basal cells also can give rise to basal-like MIBC, with pre-induction of Trp53 mutation accelerating MIBC. Thus, in BBN chemical carcinogenesis, pre-induction of Trp53 mutation in basal cells facilitates efficient modeling of the basal squamous subtype of human MIBC.","['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Keratin-5', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Urinary Bladder', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Transition matrix', 'Translational medicine', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Tumor annotation', 'Binary format', 'Veterinary medicine', 'URI']"

540,32349983,"Peripheral nerves provide a supportive growth environment for developing and regenerating axons and are essential for maintenance and repair of many non-neural tissues. This capacity has largely been ascribed to paracrine factors secreted by nerve-resident Schwann cells. Here, we used single-cell transcriptional profiling to identify ligands made by different injured rodent nerve cell types and have combined this with cell-surface mass spectrometry to computationally model potential paracrine interactions with peripheral neurons. These analyses show that peripheral nerves make many ligands predicted to act on peripheral and CNS neurons, including known and previously uncharacterized ligands. While Schwann cells are an important ligand source within injured nerves, more than half of the predicted ligands are made by nerve-resident mesenchymal cells, including the endoneurial cells most closely associated with peripheral axons. At least three of these mesenchymal ligands, ANGPT1, CCL11, and VEGFC, promote growth when locally applied on sympathetic axons. These data therefore identify an unexpected paracrine role for nerve mesenchymal cells and suggest that multiple cell types contribute to creating a highly pro-growth environment for peripheral axons.","['Axons', 'Ligands', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Schwann Cells', 'Single-Cell Analysis']","['Exons', 'Taxon', 'Introns', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence features', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis']"

A computational approach was developed that integrates transcriptomics, linkage analysis, miRNA-target prediction data, and sequence information of a mouse model of obesity and diabetes. A statistical analysis demonstrated a significant enrichment of 566 genes for a location in obesity- and diabetes-related QTL.

542,32355248,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy, often diagnosed at metastatic stages. Several studies have implicated systemic factors, such as extracellular vesicle release and myeloid cell expansion, in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches in cancer. The Rab27a GTPase is overexpressed in advanced cancers, can regulate vesicle trafficking, and has been previously linked to non-cell autonomous control of tumor growth and metastasis, however, the role of Rab27a itself in the metastatic propensity of pancreatic cancer is not well understood. Here, we have established a model to study how Rab27a directs formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Loss of Rab27a in pancreatic cancer cells did not decrease tumor growth in vivo, but resulted in altered systemic myeloid cell expansion, both in the primary tumors and at the distant organ sites. In metastasis assays, loss of Rab27a expression in tumor cells injected into circulation compromised efficient outgrowth of metastatic lesions. However, Rab27a knockdown cells had an unexpected advantage at initial steps of metastatic seeding, suggesting that Rab27a may alter cell-autonomous invasive properties of the tumor cells. Gene expression analysis of gene expression revealed that downregulation of Rab27a increased expression of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways, consistent with our findings that primary tumors arising from Rab27a knockdown cells were more invasive. Overall, these data reveal that Rab27a can play divergent roles in regulating pro-metastatic propensity of pancreatic cancer cells: by generating pro-metastatic environment at the distant organ sites, and by suppressing invasive properties of the cancer cells.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'rab27 GTP-Binding Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Epistasis', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction']"

In this study, the effect of amino acid supplementation in a chemically defined medium on cellular growth and recombinant pramlintide production was investigated. Based on the consumption profile, few amino acids were categorized as growth-promoting (GP1) and protein production promoting (GP2). Feeding strategies of GP1 and GP2 were tested in shake flasks followed by scale up into the bioreactor.

As the role of proximal tubular β-catenin signaling in CKD remains unclear, we genetically stabilized (i.e., activated) β-catenin specifically in murine proximal tubules. Mice with increased tubular β-catenin signaling were protected in 2 murine models of AKI to CKD progression. Oxidative stress, a common feature of CKD, reduced the conventional T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-dependent β-catenin signaling and augmented FoxO3-dependent activity in proximal tubule cells in vitro and in vivo. The protective effect of proximal tubular β-catenin in renal injury required the presence of FoxO3 in vivo. Furthermore, we identified cystathionine γ-lyase as a potentially novel transcriptional target of β-catenin/FoxO3 interactions in the proximal tubule.

Fine mapping of the causal variant(s) at a locus depends on assays that are able to discriminate the effects of polymorphisms or mutations on gene expression. Here, we evaluated a moderate-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis approach, based on replicated measurement of transcript abundance in single-cell clones, by deleting candidate regulatory SNPs, affecting four genes known to be affected by large-effect expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) in leukocytes, and using Fluidigm qRT-PCR to monitor gene expression in HL60 pro-myeloid human cells. We concluded that there were multiple constraints that rendered the approach generally infeasible for fine mapping. These included the non-targetability of many regulatory SNPs, clonal variability of single-cell derivatives, and expense. Power calculations based on the measured variance attributable to major sources of experimental error indicated that typical eQTL explaining 10% of the variation in expression of a gene would usually require at least eight biological replicates of each clone.

549,32379753,"Gene expression is known to be highly responsive to the environment and important for adjustment of metabolism but there is also growing evidence that differences in gene regulation contribute to species divergence and differences among locally adapted populations. However, most studies so far investigated populations when divergence had already occurred. Selection acting on expression levels at the onset of adaptation to an environmental change has not been characterized. Understanding the mechanisms is further complicated by the fact that environmental change is often multivariate, meaning that organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously with potentially interactive effects. Here we use a novel approach by combining fitness and whole-transcriptome data in a large-scale experiment to investigate responses to drought, heat and their combination in Tribolium castaneum. We found that fitness was reduced by both stressors and their combined effect was almost additive. Expression data showed that stressor responses were acting independently and did not interfere physiologically. Since we measured expression and fitness within the same individuals, we were able to estimate selection on gene expression levels. We found that variation in fitness can be attributed to gene expression variation and that selection pressures were environment dependent and opposite between control and stress conditions. We could further show that plastic responses of expression were largely adaptive, i.e. in the direction that should increase fitness.","['Animals', 'Droughts', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Insect Proteins', 'Male', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Thermotolerance', 'Tribolium']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic code', 'Genetics', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'MAT', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model accession', 'Thermo RAW', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamics', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamic data']"

Quantum barcoding (QBC) avoids isolation of single cells by building cell-specific oligo barcodes dynamically within each cell. With minimal instrumentation (four 96-well plates and a multichannel pipette), cell-specific codes are added to each tagged molecule within cells through sequential rounds of classical split-pool synthesis. Here we show the utility of this technology in mouse and human model systems for as many as 50 antibodies to targeted proteins and, separately, >70 targeted RNA regions. We demonstrate that this method can be applied to multi-modal protein and RNA analyses. It can be scaled by expansion of the split-pool process and effectively renders sequencing instruments as versatile multi-parameter flow cytometers.","['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Experimental design and studies', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis']"

Using a rat model for exposure to an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), we show that early-life chemical exposure causes metabolic dysfunction in adulthood and reprograms histone marks in the developing liver to accelerate acquisition of an adult epigenomic signature. This epigenomic reprogramming persists long after the initial exposure, but many reprogrammed genes remain transcriptionally silent with their impact on metabolism not revealed until a later life exposure to a Western-style diet. Diet-dependent metabolic disruption was largely driven by reprogramming of the Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) transcriptome and production of metabolites in pathways linked to cholesterol, lipid and one-carbon metabolism. These findings demonstrate the importance of epigenome:environment interactions, which early in life accelerate epigenomic aging, and later in adulthood unlock metabolically restricted epigenetic reprogramming to drive metabolic dysfunction.","['Animals', 'DNA Methylation', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenome', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Male', 'Rats']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Protein data', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome map', 'Genomics', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction experiment', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats']"

Chemogenetic activation of MCH neurons as well as optogenetic stimulation of their projections in the ME enhance permeability of the ME by increasing fenestrated vascular loops and enhance leptin action in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Unbiased phosphoRiboTrap-based assessment of cell activation upon chemogenetic MCH neuron activation reveals MCH-neuron-dependent regulation of endothelial cells. MCH neurons express the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and blocking VEGF-R signaling attenuates the leptin-sensitizing effect of MCH neuron activation.

553,32409602,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), Th17 cells are critical drivers of autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and demyelination. Th17 cells exhibit functional heterogeneity fostering both pathogenic and nonpathogenic, tissue-protective functions. Still, the factors that control Th17 pathogenicity remain incompletely defined. Here, using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an established mouse MS model, we report that therapeutic administration of activin-A ameliorates disease severity and alleviates CNS immunopathology and demyelination, associated with decreased activation of Th17 cells. In fact, activin-A signaling through activin-like kinase-4 receptor represses pathogenic transcriptional programs in Th17-polarized cells, while it enhances antiinflammatory gene modules. Whole-genome profiling and in vivo functional studies revealed that activation of the ATP-depleting CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases is essential for activin-A-induced suppression of the pathogenic signature and the encephalitogenic functions of Th17 cells. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, along with STAT3 and c-Maf, are recruited to promoter elements on <i>Entpd1</i> and <i>Nt5e</i> (encoding CD39 and CD73, respectively) and other antiinflammatory genes, and control their expression in Th17 cells in response to activin-A. Notably, we show that activin-A negatively regulates the metabolic sensor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and key inflammatory proteins linked to pathogenic Th17 cell states. Of translational relevance, we demonstrate that activin-A is induced in the CNS of individuals with MS and restrains human Th17 cell responses.

To examine this relationship, we used chronic social defeat (CSD) stress, which produces anxiety-like and depressive-like behavioral declines in susceptible mice. In such mice, CSD also produces cerebrovascular microbleeds in scattered locations. Here, we showed further evidence of vascular pathology and blood-brain barrier breakdown by visualizing plasma immunoglobulins and erythrocytes within the parenchyma and perivascular spaces of CSD brains. To further characterize the impact of stress on the cerebrovasculature, brain endothelial cells (bECs) were isolated, and global gene expression profiles were generated. Bioinformatic analysis of CSD-induced transcriptional changes in bECs showed enrichment in pathways that delineate the vascular response to injury. These pathways followed a temporal sequence of inflammation, oxidative stress, growth factor signaling, and wound healing (i.e., platelet aggregation, hemostasis, fibrinogen deposition, and angiogenesis). Immunohistochemical staining for markers of fibrinogen deposition and angiogenesis confirmed the existence of the markers at the sites of vascular disruptions. Recovery after CSD cessation was marked by recruitment of leukocytes perhaps participating in vascular repair. The data suggest that co-morbidity of affective disorders and vascular diseases may be attributed in part to a common link in altered endothelial cell function.","['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Social Defeat', 'Stress, Psychological']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain identifier', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'cel', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Ecological data', 'Ontology data', 'Mathematical model']"

Deregulation of miRNA expression is a hallmark of most cancers and further investigation of mechanisms controlling miRNA biogenesis is needed. The double stranded RNA-binding protein, NF90 has been shown to act as a competitor of Microprocessor for a limited number of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Here, we show that NF90 has a more widespread effect on pri-miRNA biogenesis than previously thought. Genome-wide approaches revealed that NF90 is associated with the stem region of 38 pri-miRNAs, in a manner that is largely exclusive of Microprocessor. Following loss of NF90, 22 NF90-bound pri-miRNAs showed increased abundance of mature miRNA products. NF90-targeted pri-miRNAs are highly stable, having a lower free energy and fewer mismatches compared to all pri-miRNAs. Mutations leading to less stable structures reduced NF90 binding while increasing pri-miRNA stability led to acquisition of NF90 association, as determined by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). NF90-bound and downregulated pri-miRNAs are embedded in introns of host genes and expression of several host genes is concomitantly reduced. These data suggest that NF90 controls the processing of a subset of highly stable, intronic miRNAs.","['Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences', 'MicroRNAs', 'Neoplasms', 'Nuclear Factor 90 Proteins', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional']","['Mobile genetic element ID', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Genome map', 'Human genetics', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Repeat sequences', 'Sequence', 'Sanger inverted repeats', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Gene transcription']"
557,32428001,"Sex differences in the incidence and progression of many liver diseases, including liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are associated with sex-biased hepatic expression of hundreds of genes. This sexual dimorphism is largely determined by the sex-specific pattern of pituitary growth hormone secretion, which controls a transcriptional regulatory network operative in the context of sex-biased and growth hormone-regulated chromatin states. Histone H3K27-trimethylation yields a major sex-biased repressive chromatin mark deposited at many strongly female-biased genes in male mouse liver, but not at male-biased genes in female liver, and is catalyzed by polycomb repressive complex-2 through its homologous catalytic subunits, Ezh1 and Ezh2. Here, we used Ezh1-knockout mice with a hepatocyte-specific knockout of Ezh2 to investigate the sex bias of liver H3K27-trimethylation and its functional role in regulating sex-differences in the liver. Combined hepatic Ezh1/Ezh2 deficiency led to a significant loss of sex-biased gene expression, particularly in male liver, where many female-biased genes were increased in expression while male-biased genes showed decreased expression. The associated loss of H3K27me3 marks, and increases in the active enhancer marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1, were also more pronounced in male liver. Further, Ezh1/Ezh2 deficiency in male liver, and to a lesser extent in female liver, led to up regulation of many genes linked to liver fibrosis and liver cancer, which may contribute to the observed liver pathologies and the increased sensitivity of these mice to hepatotoxin exposure. Thus, Ezh1/Ezh2-catalyzed H3K27-trimethyation regulates sex-dependent genetic programs in liver metabolism and liver fibrosis through its sex-dependent effects on the epigenome, and may thereby determine the sex-bias in liver disease susceptibility.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Histones', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sex Characteristics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'protein', 'Protein sequence', 'Protein data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Histogram', 'MAT', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Ancestral reconstruction', 'Phylogenetic character data', 'Sequence mask character']"

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of several biological processes, including cell differentiation; however, their role in establishment/maintenance of cellular identity in adult alveolar epithelium is not well understood. To investigate this question, we performed genome-wide analysis of sequential changes in miRNA and gene expression profiles using a well-established model in which human AT2 (hAT2) cells transdifferentiate into AT1-like cells over time in culture that recapitulates many aspects of transdifferentiation in vivo. We defined three phases of miRNA expression during the transdifferentiation process as ""early,"" ""late,"" and ""consistently"" changed, which were further subclassified as up- or downregulated. miRNAs with altered expression at all time points during transdifferentiation were the largest subgroup, suggesting the need for consistent regulation of signaling pathways to mediate this process. Target prediction analysis and integration with previously published gene expression data identified glucocorticoid signaling as the top pathway regulated by miRNAs. Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) emerged as a central regulatory factor, whose downregulation correlated temporally with gain of hsa-miR-424 and hsa-miR-503 expression. Functional validation demonstrated specific targeting of these miRNAs to the 3'-untranslated region of SGK1.

560,32460028,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional, chromatin, and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), which by itself is insufficient to cause disease. t(8;21) AML patients show extensive chromatin reprogramming and have acquired additional mutations. Therefore, the genomic and developmental effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this, we employ a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding, blocks differentiation, and arrests cellular growth, whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal. Single-cell gene expression analyses show that RUNX1-ETO induction alters the differentiation of early myeloid progenitors, but not of other progenitor types, indicating that oncoprotein-mediated transcriptional reprogramming is highly target cell specific.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease']"
561,32463457,"Almost 70% of human genes undergo alternative polyadenylation (APA) and generate mRNA transcripts with varying lengths, typically of the 3' untranslated regions (UTR). APA plays an important role in development and cellular differentiation, and its dysregulation can cause neuropsychiatric diseases and increase cancer severity. Increasing awareness of APA's role in human health and disease has propelled the development of several 3' sequencing (3'Seq) techniques that allow for precise identification of APA sites. However, despite the recent data explosion, there are no robust computational tools that are precisely designed to analyze 3'Seq data. Analytical approaches that have been used to analyze these data predominantly use proximal to distal usage. With about 50% of human genes having more than two APA isoforms, current methods fail to capture the entirety of APA changes and do not account for non-proximal to non-distal changes. Addressing these key challenges, this study demonstrates PolyA-miner, an algorithm to accurately detect and assess differential alternative polyadenylation specifically from 3'Seq data. Genes are abstracted as APA matrices, and differential APA usage is inferred using iterative consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based clustering. PolyA-miner accounts for all non-proximal to non-distal APA switches using vector projections and reflects precise gene-level 3'UTR changes. It can also effectively identify novel APA sites that are otherwise undetected when using reference-based approaches. Evaluation on multiple datasets-first-generation MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) brain and Universal Human Reference (UHR) PolyA-seq data, recent glioblastoma cell line NUDT21 knockdown Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq) data, and our own mouse hippocampal and human stem cell-derived neuron PAC-seq data-strongly supports the value and protocol-independent applicability of PolyA-miner. Strikingly, in the glioblastoma cell line data, PolyA-miner identified more than twice the number of genes with APA changes than initially reported. With the emerging importance of APA in human development and disease, PolyA-miner can significantly improve data analysis and help decode the underlying APA dynamics.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polyadenylation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Reference Standards', 'Software']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein modifications', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'PolyA signal detection', 'DNA methylation', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Citation', 'Data reference', 'Reference identification', 'Software engineering']"
562,32479635,"The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a maternal antibiotic administration during the last week of gestation on the early life intestinal development in neonatal piglets. Colonization of the gut with bacteria starts during birth and plays a major role in the intestinal and immunological development of the intestine. We demonstrate that maternal interventions induced changes in the sows (n = 6 to 8 per treatment) fecal microbiota diversity around birth (P < 0.001, day 1). Whole-genome microarray analysis in small intestinal samples of 1-d old piglets (n = 6 to 8 per treatment) showed significantly expressed genes (Padj < 0.05) which were involved in processes of tight junction formation and immunoglobulin production. Furthermore, when performing morphometry analysis, the number of goblet cells in jejunum was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in piglets from amoxicillin administered sows compared with the respective control piglets. Both significantly expressed genes (Padj < 0.05) and significant morphometry data (jejunum P < 0.05 and ileum P < 0.01) indicate that the crypts of piglets from amoxicillin administered sows deepen around weaning (day 26) as an effect of the amoxicillin administration in sows. The latter might imply that the intestinal development of piglets was delayed by maternal antibiotic administration. Taken together, these results show that maternally oral antibiotic administration changes in early life can affect intestinal development of the offspring piglets for a period of at least 5 wk after the maternal antibiotic administration was finished. These results show that modulation of the neonatal intestine is possible by maternal interventions.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Microbiota', 'Pregnancy', 'Swine', 'Weaning']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein variants', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Sequence', 'Sequence features', 'Gastroenterology', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'swiss feature', 'UniProtKB format', 'Data mining', 'Read binning']"
563,32482863,"Various pregnancy complications, such as severe forms of preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction, are thought to arise from failures in the differentiation of human placental trophoblasts. Progenitors of the latter either develop into invasive extravillous trophoblasts, remodeling the uterine vasculature, or fuse into multinuclear syncytiotrophoblasts transporting oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. However, key regulatory factors controlling trophoblast self-renewal and differentiation have been poorly elucidated. Using primary cells, three-dimensional organoids, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited JEG-3 clones, we herein show that YAP, the transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo signaling pathway, promotes maintenance of cytotrophoblast progenitors by different genomic mechanisms. Genetic or chemical manipulation of YAP in these cellular models revealed that it stimulates proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulators and stemness-associated genes, but inhibits cell fusion and production of syncytiotrophoblast (STB)-specific proteins, such as hCG and GDF15. Genome-wide comparisons of primary villous cytotrophoblasts overexpressing constitutively active YAP-5SA with YAP KO cells and syncytializing trophoblasts revealed common target genes involved in trophoblast stemness and differentiation. ChIP-qPCR unraveled that YAP-5SA overexpression increased binding of YAP-TEAD4 complexes to promoters of proliferation-associated genes such as <i>CCNA</i> and <i>CDK6</i> Moreover, repressive YAP-TEAD4 complexes containing the histone methyltransferase EZH2 were detected in the genomic regions of the STB-specific <i>CGB5</i> and <i>CGB7</i> genes. In summary, YAP plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the human placental trophoblast epithelium.

564,32483191,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~20 melanoma susceptibility loci, most of which are not functionally characterized. Here we report an approach integrating massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA) with cell-type-specific epigenome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to identify susceptibility genes/variants from multiple GWAS loci. From 832 high-LD variants, we identify 39 candidate functional variants from 14 loci displaying allelic transcriptional activity, a subset of which corroborates four colocalizing melanocyte cis-eQTL genes. Among these, we further characterize the locus encompassing the HIV-1 restriction gene, MX2 (Chr21q22.3), and validate a functional intronic variant, rs398206. rs398206 mediates the binding of the transcription factor, YY1, to increase MX2 levels, consistent with the cis-eQTL of MX2 in primary human melanocytes. Melanocyte-specific expression of human MX2 in a zebrafish model demonstrates accelerated melanoma formation in a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> background. Our integrative approach streamlines GWAS follow-up studies and highlights a pleiotropic function of MX2 in melanoma susceptibility.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes', 'Melanoma', 'Mutation', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Zebrafish']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene report', 'Report', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genetic code prediction', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'ELAND format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'Protein distance matrix', 'protein', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Protein data', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Phylogenetic continuous quantitative data', 'Fish']"

The inflammatory environment within tumours also influences responses to many therapies, including the efficacy of oncolytic viruses<sup>2</sup>; however, the role of CAFs in this context remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the cell signalling triggered by heterotypic cancer cell-fibroblast contacts and about what activates fibroblasts to express inflammatory mediators<sup>1,3</sup>. Here, we show that direct contact between cancer cells and CAFs triggers the expression of a wide range of inflammatory modulators by fibroblasts. This is initiated following transcytosis of cytoplasm from cancer cells into fibroblasts, leading to the activation of STING and IRF3-mediated expression of interferon-β1 and other cytokines. Interferon-β1 then drives interferon-stimulated transcriptional programs in both cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts and ultimately undermines the efficacy of oncolytic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo. Further, targeting IRF3 solely in stromal fibroblasts restores oncolytic herpes simplex virus function.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines', 'Genomic Instability', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Stromal Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Cancer type', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Genomics', 'Annotation track', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Oncology', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Virus identifier', 'cel', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"

Although many studies have focused on the adult lung, the perinatal lung remains unexplored. Here, we present an atlas of the murine lung immune compartment during early postnatal development. We show that the late embryonic lung is dominated by specialized proliferative macrophages with a surprising physical interaction with the developing vasculature. These macrophages disappear after birth and are replaced by a dynamic mixture of macrophage subtypes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Detailed characterization of macrophage diversity revealed an orchestration of distinct subpopulations across postnatal development to fill context-specific functions in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity. These data both broaden the putative roles for immune cells in the developing lung and provide a framework for understanding how external insults alter immune cell phenotype during a period of rapid lung growth and heightened vulnerability.","['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Granulocytes', 'Homeostasis', 'Immunomodulation', 'Lung', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organogenesis', 'Phenotype']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'cel', 'Epistasis', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Genetic organisation', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data']"
567,32487761,"The heterochromatin environment plays a central role in silencing genes associated with the malaria parasite's development, survival in the host, and transmission to the mosquito vector. However, the underlying mechanism regulating the dynamic chromatin structure is not understood yet. Here, we have uncovered that <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Rrp6, an orthologue of eukaryotic RNA exosome-associated RNase, controls the silencing of heterochromatic genes. PfRrp6 knockdown disrupted the singular expression of the GC-rich ncRNA RUF6 family, a known critical regulator of virulence gene expression, through the stabilization of the nascent transcripts. Mechanistic investigation showed that the accumulation of the multiple RUF6 ncRNAs triggered local chromatin remodeling <i>in situ</i>, which activated their adjacent <i>var</i> genes. Strikingly, chromatin isolation by RNA purification analysis (ChIRP-seq) revealed that a remarkable RUF6 ncRNA had interacted with distal heterochromatin regions directly and stimulated a global derepression effect on heterochromatic genes, including all variant gene families and the sexual commitment-associated regulator <i>ap2-g</i> gene. Collectively, Rrp6 appears to conduct the epigenetic surveillance of heterochromatic gene expression through controlling RUF6 levels, thereby securing antigenic variation and sexual commitment of malaria parasites during the infection of the host.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden. The heterochromatin environment controls the silencing of genes associated with the fate of malaria parasites. Previous studies have demonstrated that a group of GC-rich ncRNAs (RUF6) is associated with the mutually exclusive expression of <i>var</i> genes, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, through a series of genetic manipulation and genome-wide multiomics analysis, we have identified the plasmodial orthologue of RNA exosome-associated Rrp6 as an upstream regulator of RUF6 expression and revealed that the dysregulation of RUF6 upon Rrp6 knockdown triggered local chromatin alteration, thereby activating most heterochromatic genes via direct interaction of RUF6 and distal gene loci. This finding not only uncovered the in-depth mechanism of RUF6-mediated regulation of heterochromatic genes but also identified Rrp6 as a novel regulator of gene expression in human malaria parasites, which provides a new target for developing intervention strategies against malaria.","['Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterochromatin', 'Humans', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Protozoan Proteins', 'RNA, Untranslated', 'Virulence']","['Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'DNA translation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"

The functions of a large majority of disease-associated enhancers are unknown, in part owing to their distance from the genes they regulate, a lack of understanding of the cell types in which they operate, and our inability to recapitulate the biology of immune diseases in vitro. Here, using shared synteny to guide loss-of-function analysis of homologues of human enhancers in mice, we show that the prominent autoimmune and allergic disease risk locus at chromosome 11q13.5<sup>2-7</sup> contains a distal enhancer that is functional in CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells and required for T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression of colitis. The enhancer recruits the transcription factors STAT5 and NF-κB to mediate signal-driven expression of Lrrc32, which encodes the protein glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). Whereas disruption of the Lrrc32 gene results in early lethality, mice lacking the enhancer are viable but lack GARP expression in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells, which are unable to control colitis in a cell-transfer model of the disease. In human T<sub>reg</sub> cells, the enhancer forms conformational interactions with the promoter of LRRC32 and enhancer risk variants are associated with reduced histone acetylation and GARP expression. Finally, functional fine-mapping of 11q13.5 using CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) identifies a CRISPRa-responsive element in the vicinity of risk variant rs11236797 capable of driving GARP expression. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for association of the 11q13.5 risk locus with immune-mediated diseases and identify GARP as a potential target in their therapy.","['Acetylation', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian', 'Colitis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Synteny', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'ColiCard report format', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Synthetic biology', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction']"

However, the mechanisms underlying euchromatin establishment during early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is maintained from oocytes to fertilized embryos in Drosophila and mammals. H4K16ac forms large domains that control nucleosome accessibility of promoters prior to ZGA in flies. Maternal depletion of MOF acetyltransferase leading to H4K16ac loss causes aberrant RNA Pol II recruitment, compromises the 3D organization of the active genomic compartments during ZGA, and causes downregulation of post-zygotically expressed genes. Germline depletion of histone deacetylases revealed that other acetyl marks cannot compensate for H4K16ac loss in the oocyte. Moreover, zygotic re-expression of MOF was neither able to restore embryonic viability nor onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. Thus, maternal H4K16ac provides an instructive function to the offspring, priming future gene activation.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genome', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histones', 'Lysine', 'Male', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleosomes', 'Oocytes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'X Chromosome', 'Zygote']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Conserved transcription regulatory sequence identification', 'Sequence data', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic codes and codon usage', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Histogram', 'Analysis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
570,32503921,"Understanding the functional connection that occurs for the three nuclear RNA polymerases to synthesize ribosome components during the ribosome biogenesis process has been the focal point of extensive research. To preserve correct homeostasis on the production of ribosomal components, cells might require the existence of proteins that target a common subunit of these RNA polymerases to impact their respective activities. This work describes how the yeast prefoldin-like Bud27 protein, which physically interacts with the Rpb5 common subunit of the three RNA polymerases, is able to modulate the transcription mediated by the RNA polymerase I, likely by influencing transcription elongation, the transcription of the RNA polymerase III, and the processing of ribosomal RNA. Bud27 also regulates both RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis regulon genes, likely by occupying their DNA ORFs, and the processing of the corresponding mRNAs. With RNA polymerase II, this association occurs in a transcription rate-dependent manner. Our data also indicate that Bud27 inactivation alters the phosphorylation kinetics of ribosomal protein S6, a readout of TORC1 activity. We conclude that Bud27 impacts the homeostasis of the ribosome biogenesis process by regulating the activity of the three RNA polymerases and, in this way, the synthesis of ribosomal components. This quite likely occurs through a functional connection of Bud27 with the TOR signaling pathway.","['Cell Nucleus', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA Polymerase III', 'RNA, Ribosomal', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular charge', 'Molecular property', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide annotation', 'Peptide identification', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Chromosomes', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Protein accession', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

Soluble PDGFRα potently neutralizes HCMV in tissue culture, and its potential use as an antiviral therapeutic has the benefit that any escape mutants will likely be attenuated. However, PDGFRα binds multiple PDGF ligands in the human body as part of developmental programs in embryogenesis and continuing through adulthood. Any therapies with soluble receptor therefore come with serious efficacy and safety concerns, especially for the treatment of congenital HCMV. Soluble virus receptors that are orthogonal to human biology might resolve these concerns. This engineering problem is solved by deep mutational scanning on the D2-D3 domains of PDGFRα to identify variants that maintain interactions with the HCMV glycoprotein trimer in the presence of competing PDGF ligands. Competition by PDGFs is conformation-dependent, whereas HCMV trimer binding is independent of proper D2-D3 conformation, and many mutations at the receptor-PDGF interface are suitable for functionally separating trimer from PDGF interactions. Purified soluble PDGFRα carrying a targeted mutation succeeded in displaying wild type affinity for HCMV trimer with a simultaneous loss of PDGF binding, and neutralizes trimer-only and trimer/pentamer-expressing HCMV strains infecting fibroblasts or epithelial cells.

576,32562237,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare multisystem developmental disorder with moderate to severe intellectual disability caused by heterozygous mutations of either CREBBP or EP300 genes encoding CBP/p300 chromatin regulators. We explored the gene programs and processes underlying the morphological and functional alterations shown by iPSC-derived neurons modeling RSTS to bridge the molecular changes resulting from defective CBP/p300 to cognitive impairment. By global transcriptome analysis, we compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) marking the transition from iPSC-derived neural progenitors to cortical neurons (iNeurons) of five RSTS patients carrying private CREBBP/EP300 mutations and manifesting differently graded neurocognitive signs with those of four healthy controls. Our data shows a defective and altered neuroprogenitor to neuron transcriptional program in the cells from RSTS patients. First, transcriptional regulation is weaker in RSTS as less genes than in controls are modulated, including genes of key processes of mature functional neurons, such as those for voltage-gated channels and neurotransmitters and their receptors. Second, regulation is subverted as genes acting at pre-terminal stages of neural differentiation in cell polarity and adhesive functions (members of the cadherin family) and axon extension/guidance (members of the semaphorins and SLIT receptors families) are improperly upregulated. Impairment or delay of RSTS neuronal differentiation program is also evidenced by decreased modulation of the overall number of neural differentiation markers, significantly impacting the initial and final stages of the differentiation cascade. Last, extensive downregulation of genes for RNA/DNA metabolic processes confirms that RSTS is a global transcription disorder, consistent with a syndrome driven by chromatin dysregulation. Interestingly, the morphological and functional alterations we have previously appointed as biomarkers of RSTS iNeurons provide functional support to the herein designed transcriptome profile pointing to key dysregulated neuronal genes as main contributors to patients' cognitive deficit.

We also identify Dppa2 and Dppa4 as essential safeguards of focal epigenetic states. In their absence, developmental genes and evolutionarily young LINE1 elements, which are specifically bound by DPPA2, lose H3K4me3 and gain ectopic de novo DNA methylation in pluripotent cells. Consequently, lineage-associated genes and LINE1 acquire a repressive epigenetic memory, which renders them incompetent for activation during future lineage specification.

We found significant inter-patient variability in the composition and functional programs of ascites cells, including immunomodulatory fibroblast sub-populations and dichotomous macrophage populations. We found that the previously described immunoreactive and mesenchymal subtypes of HGSOC, which have prognostic implications, reflect the abundance of immune infiltrates and fibroblasts rather than distinct subsets of malignant cells<sup>2</sup>. Malignant cell variability was partly explained by heterogeneous copy number alteration patterns or expression of a stemness program.

580,32599615,"Although cytokine-mediated expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can result in high yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells, this generally occurs at the expense of reduced bone marrow HSC repopulating ability, thereby limiting potential therapeutic applications. Because bromodomain-containing proteins (BCPs) have been demonstrated to regulate mouse HSC self-renewal and stemness, we screened small molecules targeting various BCPs as potential agents for ex vivo expansion of human HSCs. Of 10 compounds tested, only the bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor CPI203 enhanced the expansion of human cord blood HSCs without losing cell viability in vitro. The expanded cells also demonstrated improved engraftment and repopulation in serial transplantation assays. Transcriptomic and functional studies showed that the expansion of long-term repopulating HSCs was accompanied by synchronized expansion and maturation of megakaryocytes consistent with CPI203-mediated reprogramming of cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This approach may therefore prove beneficial for ex vivo gene editing, for enhanced platelet production, and for the improved usage of cord blood for transplantation research and therapy.","['Acetamides', 'Animals', 'Azepines', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptome']","['ACE', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Transposon prediction', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'mega', 'Eukaryotes', 'meganon', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care in the treatment of older or unfit patients with AML, but responses are modest and not durable<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we demonstrate that LSCs upregulate the tumor necrosis factor family ligand CD70 in response to HMA treatment resulting in increased CD70/CD27 signaling. Blocking CD70/CD27 signaling and targeting CD70-expressing LSCs with cusatuzumab, a human αCD70 monoclonal antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, eliminated LSCs in vitro and in xenotransplantation experiments. Based on these preclinical results, we performed a phase 1/2 trial in previously untreated older patients with AML with a single dose of cusatuzumab monotherapy followed by a combination therapy with the HMA azacitidine ( NCT03030612 ). We report results from the phase 1 dose escalation part of the clinical trial.

Incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant effects hampered the identification of objective biomarkers for antidepressant response. In this work, we studied transcriptome-wide expression followed by pathway analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 17 patients documented for response to SSRI antidepressants from the Munich Antidepressant Response Signatures (MARS) study upon short-term incubation (24 and 48 h) with citalopram. Candidate transcripts were further validated with qPCR in MARS LCLs from responders (n = 33) vs. non-responders (n = 36) and afterward in an independent cohort of treatment-resistant patients (n = 20) vs. first-line responders (n = 24) from the STAR*D study. In MARS cohort we observed significant associations of GAD1 (glutamate decarboxylase 1; p = 0.045), TBC1D9 (TBC1 Domain Family Member 9; p = 0.014-0.021) and NFIB (nuclear factor I B; p = 0.015-0.025) expression with response status, remission status and improvement in depression scale, respectively. Pathway analysis of citalopram-altered gene expression indicated response-status-dependent transcriptional reactions. Whereas in clinical responders neural function pathways were primarily up- or downregulated after incubation with citalopram, deregulated pathways in non-responders LCLs mainly involved cell adhesion and immune response. Results from the STAR*D study showed a marginal association of treatment-resistant depression with NFIB (p = 0.068) but not with GAD1 (p = 0.23) and TBC1D9 (p = 0.27). Our results propose the existence of distinct pathway regulation mechanisms in responders vs. non-responders and suggest GAD1, TBC1D9, and NFIB as tentative predictors for clinical response, full remission, and improvement in depression scale, respectively, with only a weak overlap in predictors of different therapy outcome phenotypes.","['Biomarkers', 'Cell Line', 'Citalopram', 'Depression', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Humans', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Citation', 'PubMed citation', 'Gene expression', 'Expression data', 'Protein expression', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Selection detection', 'In vitro selection', 'Genome alignment']"

To investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of mitochondrial presequence processing, we employed cortical neurons and cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1-knockout human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). PITRM1 deficiency strongly induced mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) and enhanced mitochondrial clearance in iPSC-derived neurons. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β in PITRM1-knockout neurons. However, neither cell death nor protein aggregates were observed in 2D iPSC-derived cortical neuronal cultures. On the other hand, over time, cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1-knockout iPSCs spontaneously developed pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the accumulation of protein aggregates, tau pathology, and neuronal cell death. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a perturbation of mitochondrial function in all cell types in PITRM1-knockout cerebral organoids, whereas immune transcriptional signatures were substantially dysregulated in astrocytes. Importantly, we provide evidence of a protective role of UPR<sup>mt</sup> and mitochondrial clearance against impaired mitochondrial presequence processing and proteotoxic stress. Here, we propose a novel concept of PITRM1-linked neurological syndrome whereby defects of mitochondrial presequence processing induce an early activation of UPR<sup>mt</sup> that, in turn, modulates cytosolic quality control pathways. Thus, our work supports a mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and common neurodegenerative proteinopathies.","['Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Mitochondria', 'Organoids']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mitochondria', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'Organism report']"

These components were rapidly engaged following stimulation, promoting an immediate translational and glycolytic switch to ramp up the T cell activation program.

To further investigate this incompletely understood pathobiology, we characterize IL-13 effects on human airway epithelial cell cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing, finding that IL-13 generates a distinctive transcriptional state for each cell type. Specifically, we discover a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converts both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. The IL-13-remodeled epithelium secretes a pathologic, mucin-imbalanced, and innate immunity-depleted proteome that arrests mucociliary motion. Signatures of IL-13-induced cellular remodeling are mirrored by transcriptional signatures characteristic of the nasal airway epithelium within T2H versus T2-low asthmatic children.

Conditional knockout of Chd4 promotes recruitment of the architectural protein complex cohesin preferentially to gene enhancers in granule neurons in vivo. Importantly, in vivo profiling of genome architecture reveals that conditional knockout of Chd4 strengthens interactions among developmentally repressed contact domains as well as genomic loops in a manner that tightly correlates with increased accessibility, enhancer activity, and cohesin occupancy at these sites.

Similarly, primordial dwarfism in domesticated animals is linked to positive selection in minor spliceosome components. Despite being vital for limb development and size regulation, its role remains unexplored. Here, we disrupt minor spliceosome function in the developing mouse limb by ablating one of its essential components, U11 small nuclear RNA, which resulted in micromelia. Notably, earlier loss of U11 corresponded to increased severity. We find that limb size is reduced owing to elevated minor intron retention in minor intron-containing genes that regulate cell cycle. As a result, limb progenitor cells experience delayed prometaphase-to-metaphase transition and prolonged S-phase. Moreover, we observed death of rapidly dividing, distally located progenitors. Despite cell cycle defects and cell death, the spatial expression of key limb patterning genes was maintained.

Among these, the TCRA gene enhancer (Eα) is in an open and unmethylated chromatin structure well before activation. Integrative analyses revealed that the HOXA5-9 transcription factors repress the Eα enhancer at early stages of T cell differentiation, while their decommission is required for TCRA locus activation and enforced αβ T lineage differentiation. Remarkably, the HOXA-mediated repression of Eα is paralleled by the ectopic expression of homeodomain-related oncogenes in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

593,32686824,"Estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) metabolically inactivates estrogen and SULT1E1 expression is tightly regulated by multiple nuclear receptors. Human fetal, but not adult, livers express appreciable amounts of SULT1E1 protein, which is mimicked in human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells cultured in high glucose (450 mg/dl) medium. Here, we have investigated this glucose signal that leads to phosphorylation of nuclear receptor RORα (NR1F1) at Ser100 and the transcription mechanism by which phosphorylated RORα transduces this signal to nuclear receptor HNF4α, activating the SULT1E1 promoter. The promoter is repressed by non-phosphorylated RORα which binds a distal enhancer (-943/-922 bp) and interacts with and represses HNF4α-mediated transcription. In response to high glucose, RORα becomes phosphorylated at Ser100 and reverses its repression of HNF4α promoter activation. Moreover, the casein kinase CK1α, which is identified in an enhancer-bound nuclear protein complex, phosphorylates Ser100 in in vitro kinase assays. During these dynamic processes, both RORα and HNF4α remain on the enhancer. Thus, RORα utilizes phosphorylation to integrate HNF4α and transduces the glucose signal to regulate the SULT1E1 gene in HepG2 cells and this phosphorylation-mediated mechanism may also regulate SULT1E1 expressions in the human liver.","['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Casein Kinase Ialpha', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Estrogens', 'Glucose', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfotransferases']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Kinase name', 'Protein chain (C-alpha atoms)', 'Pathogens', 'COGEME EST ID', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Keyword']"

Our work indicates that OXPHOS bioenergetic compensation in LHON peripheral cells does not explain disease phenotype. We show that complex I impairment is similar in cells from unaffected carrier and affected patients, despite a transcriptional downregulation of metabolic pathways including glycolysis in affected cells relative to carriers detected by RNA sequencing. Although we did not detect OXPHOS bioenergetic compensation in carrier cells under basal conditions, our results indicate that cells from affected patients suffer a growth impairment under metabolic challenge compared to carrier cells, which were unaffected by metabolic challenge.

Here, by means of RNA-Seq, we monitored the early steps of biofilm production in M. bovis BCG, to distinguish intercellular aggregation from attachment to a surface. Genes encoding for the transcriptional regulators dosR and BCG0114 (Rv0081) were significantly regulated and responded differently to intercellular aggregation and surface attachment. Moreover, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv deletion mutant in the Rv3134c-dosS-dosR regulon, formed less biofilm than wild type M. tuberculosis, a phenotype reverted upon reintroduction of this operon into the mutant. Combining RT-qPCR with microbiological assays (colony and surface pellicle morphologies, biofilm quantification, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, growth curve and replication of planktonic cells), we found that BCG0642c affected biofilm production and replication of planktonic BCG, whereas ethR affected only phenotypes linked to planktonic cells despite its downregulation at the intercellular aggregation step.

597,32746894,"Chronic early life stress can affect development of the neuroendocrine stress system, leading to its persistent dysregulation and consequently increased disease risk in adulthood. One contributing factor is thought to be epigenetic programming in response to chronic cortisol exposure during early development. We have previously shown that zebrafish embryos treated chronically with cortisol develop into adults with constitutively elevated whole-body cortisol and aberrant immune gene expression. Here we further characterize that phenotype by assessing persistent effects of the treatment on cortisol tissue distribution and dynamics, chromatin accessibility, and activities of glucocorticoid-responsive regulatory genes klf9 and fkbp5. To that end cortisol levels in different tissues of fed and fasted adults were measured using ELISA, open chromatin in adult blood cells was mapped using ATAC-seq, and gene activity in adult blood and brain cells was measured using qRT-PCR.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Zebrafish']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Protein hydropathy data', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Fish']"

Cancer-specific fusion oncoproteins, which display unique chromatin localization patterns, often lack classical DNA-binding domains, presenting challenges in identifying mechanisms governing their site-specific chromatin targeting and function. Here we identify a minimal region of the human SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein (the hallmark driver of synovial sarcoma) that mediates a direct interaction between the mSWI/SNF complex and the nucleosome acidic patch. This binding results in altered mSWI/SNF composition and nucleosome engagement, driving cancer-specific mSWI/SNF complex targeting and gene expression. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of SSX confers preferential affinity to repressed, H2AK119Ub-marked nucleosomes, underlying the selective targeting to polycomb-marked genomic regions and synovial sarcoma-specific dependency on PRC1 function.

Although Notch1 is known to be indispensable, we show that it does not mediate all Notch signaling in precommitment stages: Notch2 initially works in parallel to promote early murine T cell development and antagonize other fates. Notch-regulated target genes before and after T lineage commitment change dynamically, and we show that this partially reflects shifts in genome-wide DNA binding by RBPJ, the transcription factor activated by complex formation with the Notch intracellular domain. Although Notch signaling and transcription factor PU.1 can activate some common targets in precommitment T progenitors, Notch signaling and PU.1 activity have functionally antagonistic effects on multiple targets, delineating separation of pro-T cells from alternative PU.1-dependent fates.

We studied the gene expression profiles of LLC-PK1 cells, with or without SVA infection, for 6 h and 12 h using an RNA-seq technology. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Immune-related genes and pathways were significantly modified after SVA infection. To confirm the RNA-seq data, 28 important DEGs were selected for RT-qPCR assays. All DEGs exhibited expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq results. Among them, type I IFNs (including IFN-α and IFN-β) showed the largest upregulation, followed by RSAD2, DDX58, MX1 and the 17 other DEGs. In contrary, ID2 and another 5 DEGs were down-regulated or unchanged. These results indicated that type I IFNs play a critical role in host immune responses against SVA infection at early stage, while other immune-regulated genes directly or indirectly participate in the host immune responses.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Interferon Type I', 'Picornaviridae', 'Swine', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'RNAVirusDB ID', 'swiss feature', 'UniProtKB format', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
602,32811813,"Despite their emerging relevance to fully understand disease pathogenesis, we have as yet a poor understanding as to how biomechanical signals are integrated with specific biochemical pathways to determine cell behaviour. Mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) markers colocalized with TGF-β1-dependent signaling and yes-associated protein (YAP) activation across biopsies from different pathologies exhibiting peritoneal fibrosis, supporting mechanotransduction as a central driving component of these class of fibrotic lesions and its crosstalk with specific signaling pathways. Transcriptome and proteome profiling of the response of mesothelial cells (MCs) to linear cyclic stretch revealed molecular changes compatible with bona fide MMT, which (i) overlapped with established YAP target gene subsets, and were largely dependent on endogenous TGF-β1 signaling. Importantly, TGF-β1 blockade blunts the transcriptional upregulation of these gene signatures, but not the mechanical activation and nuclear translocation of YAP per se. We studied the role therein of caveolin-1 (CAV1), a plasma membrane mechanotransducer. Exposure of CAV1-deficient MCs to cyclic stretch led to a robust upregulation of MMT-related gene programs, which was blunted upon TGF-β1 inhibition. Conversely, CAV1 depletion enhanced both TGF-β1 and TGFBRI expression, whereas its re-expression blunted mechanical stretching-induced MMT. CAV1 genetic deficiency exacerbated MMT and adhesion formation in an experimental murine model of peritoneal ischaemic buttons. Taken together, these results support that CAV1-YAP/TAZ fine-tune the fibrotic response through the modulation of MMT, onto which TGF-β1-dependent signaling coordinately converges. Our findings reveal a cooperation between biomechanical and biochemical signals in the triggering of MMT, representing a novel potential opportunity to intervene mechanically induced disorders coursing with peritoneal fibrosis, such as post-surgical adhesions.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Caveolin 1', 'Caveolins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peritoneal Dialysis', 'Peritoneal Fibrosis', 'Peritoneum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Tissue Adhesions', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']","['Proteins', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Transition matrix', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Biobank', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID']"

Although these differences are widely recognized, it is not clear how the transition from fetal to adult identity is coordinated. Here we show that murine HSCs and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) undergo a gradual, rather than precipitous, transition from fetal to adult transcriptional states. The transition begins prior to birth and is punctuated by a late prenatal spike in type I interferon signaling that promotes perinatal HPC expansion and sensitizes progenitors to the leukemogenic FLT3<sup>ITD</sup> mutation. Most other changes in gene expression and enhancer activation are imprecisely timed and poorly coordinated. Thus, heterochronic enhancer elements, and their associated transcripts, are activated independently of one another rather than as part of a robust network.

We showed that aberrant N-terminally truncated isoforms are not functional in mESCs. In the generated knockout line, we observed that canonical Wnt signaling is not active, as β-catenin ablation does not alter mESC transcriptional profile in serum/LIF culture conditions. In addition, we observed that Wnt signaling activation represses mESC spontaneous differentiation in a β-catenin-dependent manner.

Additionally, we identify a compartment at the interface between the canonical A and B compartments that is reorganized in tumors.

608,32855205,"Expression of the transcription factor brachyury (TBXT) is normally restricted to the embryo, and its silencing is epigenetically regulated. TBXT promotes mesenchymal transition in a subset of common carcinomas, and in chordoma, a rare cancer showing notochordal differentiation, TBXT acts as a putative oncogene. We hypothesized that TBXT expression is controlled through epigenetic inhibition to promote chordoma cell death. Screening of five human chordoma cell lines revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of the histone 3 lysine 27 demethylases KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) leads to cell death. This effect was phenocopied by dual genetic inactivation of KDM6A/B using CRISPR/Cas9. Inhibition of KDM6A/B with a novel compound KDOBA67 led to a genome-wide increase in repressive H3K27me3 marks with concomitant reduction in active H3K27ac, H3K9ac, and H3K4me3 marks. <i>TBXT</i> was a KDM6A/B target gene, and chromatin changes at <i>TBXT</i> following KDOBA67 treatment were associated with a reduction in TBXT protein levels in all models tested, including primary patient-derived cultures. In all models tested, KDOBA67 treatment downregulated expression of a network of transcription factors critical for chordoma survival and upregulated pathways dominated by ATF4-driven stress and proapoptotic responses. Blocking the AFT4 stress response did not prevent suppression of TBXT and induction of cell death, but ectopic overexpression of <i>TBXT</i> increased viability, therefore implicating TBXT as a potential therapeutic target of H3K27 demethylase inhibitors in chordoma. Our work highlights how knowledge of normal processes in fetal development can provide insight into tumorigenesis and identify novel therapeutic approaches.

There is an inadequate understanding of the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on the nature/time course of transcriptional responses, self-renewal of AΦ, and the contribution from bone marrow (BM) to this population. Accordingly, we exposed chimeric (CD45.2/CD45.1) mice to concentrated PM<sub>2.5</sub> or filtered air (FA) to evaluate the impact on these end-points. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure for 4-weeks induced an influx of BM-derived monocytes into the lungs with no contribution to the overall TR-AΦ pool. Chronic (32-weeks) PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on the other hand while associated with increased recruitment of BM-derived monocytes and their incorporation into the AΦ population, resulted in enhanced apoptosis and decreased proliferation of TR-AΦ. RNA-seq analysis of isolated TR-AΦ and BM-AΦ from 4- and 32-weeks exposed mice revealed a unique time-dependent pattern of differentially expressed genes. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure resulted in altered histological changes in the lungs, a reduced alveolar fraction which corresponded to protracted lung inflammation.

610,32876513,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark of aggressive, mesenchymal-like high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). The SRC kinase is a key driver of cancer-associated EMT promoting adherens junction (AJ) disassembly by phosphorylation-driven internalization and degradation of AJ proteins. Here, we show that the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is up-regulated in mesenchymal-like HGSOC and promotes SRC activation by a previously unknown protein-ligand-induced, but RNA-independent mechanism. IGF2BP1-driven invasive growth of ovarian cancer cells essentially relies on the SRC-dependent disassembly of AJs. Concomitantly, IGF2BP1 enhances ERK2 expression in an RNA-binding dependent manner. Together this reveals a post-transcriptional mechanism of interconnected stimulation of SRC/ERK signalling in ovarian cancer cells. The IGF2BP1-SRC/ERK2 axis is targetable by the SRC-inhibitor saracatinib and MEK-inhibitor selumetinib. However, due to IGF2BP1-directed stimulation, only combinatorial treatment effectively overcomes the IGF2BP1-promoted invasive growth in 3D culture conditions as well as intraperitoneal mouse models. In conclusion, we reveal an unexpected role of IGF2BP1 in enhancing SRC/MAPK-driven invasive growth of ovarian cancer cells.

Among the various downstream AKT targets are the Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TFs) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which are negatively regulated by AKT signaling. Here we show that abrogation of AKT signaling in MM cells provokes cell death and cell cycle arrest, which crucially depends on both FOXO TFs and GSK3. Based on gene expression profiling, we defined a FOXO-repressed gene set that has prognostic significance in a large cohort of patients with MM, indicating that AKT-mediated gene activation is associated with inferior overall survival. We further show that AKT signaling stabilizes the antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein by inhibiting FOXO- and GSK3-mediated MCL1 turnover. In concordance, abrogation of AKT signaling greatly sensitized MM cells for an MCL1-targeting BH3-mimetic, which is currently in clinical development. Taken together, our results indicate that AKT activity is required to restrain the tumor-suppressive functions of FOXO and GSK3, thereby stabilizing the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 in MM. These novel insights into the role of AKT in MM pathogenesis and MCL1 regulation provide opportunities to improve targeted therapy for patients with MM.","['Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction']","['Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Kinase name', 'GlycoMap ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Sequence alignment', 'Multiple structure alignment', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Failure to maintain proteostasis is associated with aging and disease, leading to concerted efforts to study how the network responds to various proteotoxic stresses. This is often accomplished using ectopic overexpression of well-characterized, model misfolded protein substrates. However, how cells tolerate large-scale, diverse burden to the proteostasis network is not understood. Aneuploidy, the state of imbalanced chromosome content, adversely affects the proteostasis network by dysregulating the expression of hundreds of proteins simultaneously.

616,32900540,"Livestock production is a fundamental source of revenue and nutrition, wherein cattle-farming constitutes one of the major agricultural industries. Vectors and vector-borne diseases constitute one of the major factors that decrease the livelihood of all farming communities, more so in resource-poor communities and developing countries. Understanding the immunological responses during tick infestation in cattle is instrumental in the development of novel and improved tick control strategies, such as vaccines. In this study, gene expression patterns were compared within the lymph nodes of three cattle breeds at different life stages of the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus. For Bonsmara (5/8Bos taurus indicus × 3/8B. t. taurus) cattle specifically, some 183 genes were found to be differentially expressed within the lymph nodes during larval and adult tick feeding, relative to uninfested cattle. Overall, the data provides evidence for a transcriptional regulatory network that is activated during immature tick infestation, but is down-regulated towards basal transcriptional levels when adult ticks are feeding. Specific processes in the lymph nodes of Bonsmara cattle were found to be differentially regulated on a transcriptional level. These include: (1) Leukocyte recruitment to the lymph node via chemokines and chemotaxis, (2) Trans-endothelial and intranodal movement on the reticular network, (3) Active regulation of cellular transcription and translation in the lymph node (including leukocyte associated cellular regulatory networks) and (4) Chemokine receptors regulating the movement of cells out of the lymph node. This work provides a first transcriptome analysis of bovine lymph node responses in tick-infested cattle. Findings show a dynamic immune response to tick infestation for the Bonsmara cattle breed, and that suppression of the maturation of the cattle hosts' immunity is especially evident during the larval feeding stages.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Rhipicephalus', 'Tick Infestations', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'CATH node', 'CATH node ID', 'SCOP node', 'Epistasis', 'Statistical inference', 'Relation extraction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

To understand the pathogenicity and antigenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to profile the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The current map of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity is based on computational predictions and relies on homology with other coronaviruses. As the protein complement varies among coronaviruses, especially in regard to the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Here, using a suite of ribosome-profiling techniques<sup>2-4</sup>, we present a high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which enables us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs that are likely to have a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; instead, virus translation dominates host translation because of the high levels of viral transcripts.

Here, we address the question of whether mTORC1 activation or suppression is beneficial for skeletal muscle aging. We demonstrate that chronic mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin is overwhelmingly, but not entirely, positive for aging mouse skeletal muscle, while genetic, muscle fiber-specific activation of mTORC1 is sufficient to induce molecular signatures of sarcopenia. Through integration of comprehensive physiological and extensive gene expression profiling in young and old mice, and following genetic activation or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, we establish the phenotypically-backed, mTORC1-focused, multi-muscle gene expression atlas, SarcoAtlas (https://sarcoatlas.scicore.unibas.ch/), as a user-friendly gene discovery tool.

We found that zinc no longer protects in animals which lack glucocorticoids (GCs), or express mutant versions of their receptor GR in IECs, nor in mice which lack gut microbiota. RNA-seq studies in IECs showed that zinc caused reduction in expression of constitutive (STAT1-induced) interferon-stimulated response (ISRE) genes and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) genes. Since some of these genes are involved in TNF-induced cell death in intestinal crypt Paneth cells, and since zinc has direct effects on the composition of the gut microbiota (such as several Staphylococcus species) and on TNF-induced Paneth cell death, we postulate a new zinc-related anti-inflammatory mechanism. Zinc modulates the gut microbiota, causing less induction of ISRE/IRF genes in crypt cells, less TNF-induced necroptosis in Paneth cells, and less fatal evasion of gut bacteria into the system.","['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Interferons', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Mice', 'Paneth Cells', 'Zinc']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'Statistical calculation', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'DNA testing', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'cel', 'Zinc finger prediction', 'ZIP format']"

We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential.

To deconstruct the heterogeneity and unravel the mechanisms for successful reprogramming, we adopted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-Seq) to profile reprogramming cells across various time points. Our analysis revealed that reprogramming cells proceed in an asynchronous trajectory and diversify into heterogeneous subpopulations. We identified fluorescent probes and surface markers to enrich for the early reprogrammed human cells. Furthermore, combinatory usage of the surface markers enabled the fine segregation of the early-intermediate cells with diverse reprogramming propensities. scATAC-Seq analysis further uncovered the genomic partitions and transcription factors responsible for the regulatory phasing of reprogramming process. Binary choice between a FOSL1 and a TEAD4-centric regulatory network determines the outcome of a successful reprogramming. Together, our study illuminates the multitude of diverse routes transversed by individual reprogramming cells and presents an integrative roadmap for identifying the mechanistic part list of the reprogramming machinery.","['Cellular Reprogramming', 'Chromatin', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome']","['Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Analysis', 'Single particle analysis', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

This multi-faceted nature and the slow turnover of NPC components complicates investigations of how individual nucleoporins act in these diverse processes. To address this question, we apply an Auxin-Induced Degron (AID) system to distinguish roles of basket nucleoporins NUP153, NUP50 and TPR. Acute depletion of TPR causes rapid and pronounced changes in transcriptomic profiles. These changes are dissimilar to shifts observed after loss of NUP153 or NUP50, but closely related to changes caused by depletion of mRNA export receptor NXF1 or the GANP subunit of the TRanscription-EXport-2 (TREX-2) mRNA export complex. Moreover, TPR depletion disrupts association of TREX-2 subunits (GANP, PCID2, ENY2) to NPCs and results in abnormal RNA transcription and export.

During expansion, hPGCLCs maintain an early hPGC-like transcriptome and preserve their genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, most likely due to retention of maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity. These characteristics contrast starkly with those of mouse PGCLCs, which, under an analogous condition, show a limited propagation (up to ~50-fold) and persist only around 1 week, yet undergo cell-autonomous genome-wide DNA demethylation. Importantly, upon aggregation culture with mouse embryonic ovarian somatic cells in xenogeneic-reconstituted ovaries, expanded hPGCLCs initiate genome-wide DNA demethylation and differentiate into oogonia/gonocyte-like cells, demonstrating their germline potential.

Here, we identify a transcription factor network as a target of Qsp1. Using whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation, we find Qsp1 controls the genomic associations of three transcription factors to genes whose outputs are regulated by Qsp1. One of these transcription factors, Cqs2, is also required for the action of Qsp1 during mating, indicating that it might be a shared proximal target of Qsp1. Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of CQS2 impacts the binding of other network transcription factors specifically to Qsp1-regulated genes.

628,32959884,"Genome-wide association studies have reported that, amongst other microglial genes, variants in TREM2 can profoundly increase the incidence of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have investigated the role of TREM2 in primary microglial cultures from wild type mice by using siRNA to decrease Trem2 expression, and in parallel from knock-in mice heterozygous or homozygous for the Trem2 R47H AD risk variant. The prevailing phenotype of Trem2 R47H knock-in mice was decreased expression levels of Trem2 in microglia, which resulted in decreased density of microglia in the hippocampus. Overall, primary microglia with reduced Trem2 expression, either by siRNA or from the R47H knock-in mice, displayed a similar phenotype. Comparison of the effects of decreased Trem2 expression under conditions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory or IL-4 anti-inflammatory stimulation revealed the importance of Trem2 in driving a number of the genes up-regulated in the anti-inflammatory phenotype. RNA-seq analysis showed that IL-4 induced the expression of a program of genes including Arg1 and Ap1b1 in microglia, which showed an attenuated response to IL-4 when Trem2 expression was decreased. Genes showing a similar expression profile to Arg1 were enriched for STAT6 transcription factor recognition elements in their promoter, and Trem2 knockdown decreased levels of STAT6. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory stimulation suppressed Trem2 expression, thus preventing TREM2's anti-inflammatory drive. Given that anti-inflammatory signaling is associated with tissue repair, understanding the signaling mechanisms downstream of Trem2 in coordinating the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance of microglia, particularly mediating effects of the IL-4-regulated anti-inflammatory pathway, has important implications for fighting neurodegenerative disease.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Medical informatics', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'EM Micrograph', 'Microbiology', 'RNA annotation format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"
629,32961898,"Animal fats are considered to be unhealthy, in contrast to vegetable fats, which are rich in unsaturated fatty acids. However, the use of some fats, such as coconut oil, is still controversial. In our experiment, we divided experimental animals (domestic pigs) into three groups differing only in the type of fat used in the diet: group R: rapeseed oil (<i>n</i> = 5); group B: beef tallow (<i>n</i> = 5); group C: coconut oil (<i>n</i> = 6). After transcriptomic analysis of liver samples, we identified 188, 93, and 53 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in R vs. B, R vs. C, and B vs. C comparisons, respectively. Next, we performed a functional analysis of identified DEGs with String and IPA software. We observed the enrichment of genes engaged in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the acute phase response among genes upregulated in B compared to R. In contrast, cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol efflux enrichments were observed among genes downregulated in B when compared to R. Moreover, activation of the UPR and inhibition of the sirtuin signaling pathway were noted in C when compared to R. The most striking difference in liver transcriptomic response between C and B was the activation of the acute phase response and inhibition of bile acid synthesis in the latest group. Our results suggest that excessive consumption of animal fats leads to the activation of a cascade of mutually propelling processes harmful to the liver: inflammation, UPR, and imbalances in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and bile acids via altered organelle membrane composition.

630,32966340,"During alcohol consumption, the esophageal mucosa is directly exposed to high concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). We therefore investigated the response of normal human esophageal epithelial cell lines EPC1, EPC2 and EPC3 to acute EtOH exposure. While these cells were able to tolerate 2% EtOH for 8 h in both three-dimensional organoids and monolayer culture conditions, RNA sequencing suggested that EtOH induced mitochondrial dysfunction. With EtOH treatment, EPC1 and EPC2 cells also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial ATPB protein expression by immunofluorescence and swollen mitochondria lacking intact cristae by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was decreased in a subset of EPC1 and EPC2 cells stained with ΔΨm-sensitive dye MitoTracker Deep Red. In EPC2, EtOH decreased ATP level while impairing mitochondrial respiration and electron transportation chain functions, as determined by ATP fluorometric assay, respirometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, EPC2 cells demonstrated enhanced oxidative stress by flow cytometry for mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), which was antagonized by the mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoCP. Concurrently, EPC1 and EPC2 cells underwent autophagy following EtOH exposure, as evidenced by flow cytometry for Cyto-ID, which detects autophagic vesicles, and immunoblots demonstrating induction of the lipidated and cleaved form of LC3B and downregulation of SQSTM1/p62. In EPC1 and EPC2, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine increased mitochondrial oxidative stress while decreasing cell viability. In EPC2, autophagy induction was coupled with phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, and dephosphorylation of downstream substrates of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex (mTORC)-1 signaling. Pharmacological AMPK activation by AICAR decreased EtOH-induced reduction of ΔΨm and ATP in EPC2.

Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182 genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-γ (IFNγ). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFNγ and TNF. Through the mapping of cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in vivo CRISPR screens, we show how the pleiotropic effects of autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the tumour microenvironment. Collectively, these data expand our knowledge of the genetic circuits that are involved in the evasion of the immune system by cancer cells, and highlight genetic interactions that contribute to phenotypes associated with escape from killing by CTLs.","['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasms', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic', 'Tumor Escape']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Tumor annotation']"

We define a mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism controls the development and differentiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Disruption of distal cholesterol biosynthesis by conditional inactivation of the rate-limiting enzyme Nsdhl or treatment with cholesterol-lowering statins switches glandular pancreatic carcinomas to a basal (mesenchymal) phenotype in mouse models driven by Kras<sup>G12D</sup> expression and homozygous Trp53 loss. Consistently, PDACs in patients receiving statins show enhanced mesenchymal features. Mechanistically, statins and NSDHL loss induce SREBP1 activation, which promotes the expression of Tgfb1, enabling epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Defects in OFT development can lead to severe malformations, including aortic aneurysms, which are frequently associated with impaired TGF-β signaling. To better understand the role of TGF-β signaling in OFT formation, we generated zebrafish lacking the TGF-β receptor Alk5 and found a strikingly specific dilation of the OFT: <i>alk5-/-</i> OFTs exhibit increased EC numbers as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and SMC disorganization. Surprisingly, endothelial-specific <i>alk5</i> overexpression in <i>alk5</i>-/- rescues the EC, ECM, and SMC defects. Transcriptomic analyses reveal downregulation of the ECM gene <i>fibulin-5,</i> which when overexpressed in ECs ameliorates OFT morphology and function.

We have uncovered a latent potential in neural stem cells to replace large numbers of lost oligodendrocytes in the injured mouse spinal cord. Integrating multimodal single-cell analysis, we found that neural stem cells are in a permissive chromatin state that enables the unfolding of a normally latent gene expression program for oligodendrogenesis after injury. Ectopic expression of the transcription factor OLIG2 unveiled abundant stem cell-derived oligodendrogenesis, which followed the natural progression of oligodendrocyte differentiation, contributed to axon remyelination, and stimulated functional recovery of axon conduction.

635,33010366,"A plethora of natural products emerges as attractive molecules in the struggle against antibiotic resistance. These molecules impose their bioactivities not only alone but also in combinations as well, which further enhances their effects. Berberine is a well-known isoquinoline alkaloid with antibacterial activity. Unfortunately, it is readily extruded, which significantly reduces its efficacy and restricts its potential. Thymol is a monoterpenic phenol that exhibits different biological activities but its major effect is observed only at relatively high concentrations, which raises concern on cytotoxicity. The aim of the study was to potentiate the antibacterial activity of berberine, in a combination treatment with thymol in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and understand the antibacterial mechanism of the combination treatment. The synergism of berberine and thymol was first established by the checkerboard assay. Then the antibacterial mechanism of the synergistic combination was explored by growth curves, biofilm formation assay, SEM observation, and RNA-Seq based transcriptomic profiling. Checkerboard assay showed that 32 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> berberine and 64 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> thymol was a synergistic combination, both concentrations below their cytotoxicity limits for many cells. 32 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> berberine and 32 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> thymol was sufficient to inhibit biofilm formation. SEM images confirmed the morphological changes on the structure of combination treated cells. The major finding of the combination treatment from the transcriptomic analysis was the repression in the expression of virulence factors or genes related to virulence factors. Apart from the particular changes related to the cell envelope, the majority of expressional changes seemed to be similar to berberine-treated cells or to be resulting from general stress conditions. The findings of this work showed that when thymol was used in combination with berberine, it enhanced the antibacterial activity of berberine in a synergistic manner. Furthermore, thymol could be considered as an antivirulence agent, disarming S. aureus cells.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Berberine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Thymol']","['Drug metabolism', 'Drug name', 'Drug report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Statistical inference', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Locus ID']"
636,33021995,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions.

Patients with MLIII gamma typically present with osteoarthritis and joint stiffness, suggesting cartilage involvement. Using <i>Gnptg</i> knockout (<i>Gnptg<sup>ko</sup></i> ) mice as a model of the human disease, we showed that missorting of a number of lysosomal enzymes is associated with intracellular accumulation of chondroitin sulfate in <i>Gnptg<sup>ko</sup></i> chondrocytes and their impaired differentiation, as well as with altered microstructure of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). We also demonstrated distinct functional and structural properties of the Achilles tendons isolated from <i>Gnptg<sup>ko</sup></i> and <i>Gnptab</i> knock-in (<i>Gnptab<sup>ki</sup></i> ) mice, the latter displaying a more severe phenotype resembling mucolipidosis type II (MLII) in humans.

638,33024045,"Only four species, <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>C. glabrata</i>, <i>C. parapsilosis</i>, and <i>C. tropicalis</i>, together account for about 90% of all <i>Candida</i> bloodstream infections and are among the most common causes of invasive fungal infections of humans. However, virulence potential varies among these species, and the phylogenetic tree reveals that their pathogenicity may have emerged several times independently during evolution. We therefore tested these four species in a human whole-blood infection model to determine, via comprehensive dual-species RNA-sequencing analyses, which fungal infection strategies are conserved and which are recent evolutionary developments. The <i>ex vivo</i> infection progressed from initial immune cell interactions to nearly complete killing of all fungal cells. During the course of infection, we characterized important parameters of pathogen-host interactions, such as fungal survival, types of interacting immune cells, and cytokine release. On the transcriptional level, we obtained a predominantly uniform and species-independent human response governed by a strong upregulation of proinflammatory processes, which was downregulated at later time points after most of the fungal cells were killed. In stark contrast, we observed that the different fungal species pursued predominantly individual strategies and showed significantly different global transcriptome patterns. Among other findings, our functional analyses revealed that the fungal species relied on different metabolic pathways and virulence factors to survive the host-imposed stress. These data show that adaptation of <i>Candida</i> species as a response to the host is not a phylogenetic trait, but rather has likely evolved independently as a prerequisite to cause human infections.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To ensure their survival, pathogens have to adapt immediately to new environments in their hosts, for example, during the transition from the gut to the bloodstream. Here, we investigated the basis of this adaptation in a group of fungal species which are among the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections, the <i>Candida</i> species. On the basis of a human whole-blood infection model, we studied which genes and processes are active over the course of an infection in both the host and four different <i>Candida</i> pathogens. Remarkably, we found that, while the human host response during the early phase of infection is predominantly uniform, the pathogens pursue largely individual strategies and each one regulates genes involved in largely disparate processes in the blood. Our results reveal that <i>C. albicans</i>, <i>C. glabrata</i>, <i>C. parapsilosis</i>, and <i>C. tropicalis</i> all have developed individual strategies for survival in the host. This indicates that their pathogenicity in humans has evolved several times independently and that genes which are central for survival in the host for one species may be irrelevant in another.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Blood', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Cytokines', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Microbial Viability', 'Phylogeny', 'Virulence']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'BLC', 'IDAT', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbiology', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier', 'Sequence']"

We show that LSD1 inhibition in MCC disrupts the LSD1-CoREST complex leading to displacement and degradation of HMG20B (BRAF35), a poorly characterized complex member that is essential for MCC proliferation. Inhibition of LSD1 causes derepression of transcriptional master regulators of the neuronal lineage, activates a gene expression signature resembling normal Merkel cells, and induces cell cycle arrest and cell death. Our study unveils the importance of LSD1 for maintaining cellular plasticity and proliferation in MCC. There is also growing evidence that cancer cells exploit cellular plasticity and dedifferentiation programs to evade destruction by the immune system.

We find that IFN-λ-induced gene expression in B cells is steady, prolonged, and importantly, cell type specific. Furthermore, IFN-λ enhances the mTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) pathway in B cells activated by the B cell receptor (BCR/anti-IgM). Engagement of mTORC1 by BCR and IFN-λ induces cell-cycle progress in B cells. Subsequently, IFN-λ boosts the differentiation of naive B cells into plasmablasts upon activation, and the cells gain effector functions such as cytokine release (IL-6 and IL-10) and antibody production. Our study shows how IFN-λ systematically boosts the differentiation of naive B cells into plasmablasts by enhancing the mTORC1 pathway and cell-cycle progression in activated B cells.","['B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Plasma Cells']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'PlasMapper TextMap']"

The fraction of the latter cells harboring NOTCH1 amplification is expanded by chronic UVA exposure, to which CAFs are resistant. The advantage conferred by NOTCH1 amplification and overexpression can be explained by NOTCH1 ability to block the DNA damage response (DDR) and ensuing growth arrest through suppression of ATM-FOXO3a association and downstream signaling cascade.

We used both murine and human systems to uncover the mechanisms whereby GVHD induces donor pDC defects. GVHD depleted Flt3-expressing donor multipotent progenitors (MPPs) that sustained pDCs, leading to impaired generation of pDCs. MPP loss was associated with decreased amounts of MPP-producing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and oxidative stress-induced death of proliferating MPPs. Additionally, alloreactive T cells produced GM-CSF to inhibit MPP expression of Tcf4, the transcription factor essential for pDC development, subverting MPP production of pDCs. GM-CSF did not affect the maturation of pDC precursors. Notably, enhanced recovery of donor pDCs upon adoptive transfer early after allogeneic HSC transplantation repressed GVHD and restored the de novo generation of donor pDCs in recipient mice. pDCs suppressed the proliferation and expansion of activated autologous T cells via a type I IFN signaling-dependent mechanism. They also produced PD-L1 and LILRB4 to inhibit T cell production of IFN-γ.

646,33098193,"Human skin is exposed daily to environmental stressors, which cause acute damage and inflammation. Over time, this leads to morphological and visual appearance changes associated with premature ageing. Topical vitamin A derivatives such as retinol (ROL), retinyl palmitate (RPalm) and retinyl propionate (RP) have been used to reverse these changes and improve the appearance of skin. This study investigated a stoichiometric comparison of these retinoids using in vitro and ex vivo skin models. Skin biopsies were treated topically to compare skin penetration and metabolism. Treated keratinocytes were evaluated for transcriptomics profiling and hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis and treated 3D epidermal skin equivalents were stained for epidermal thickness, Ki67 and filaggrin. A retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARα) reporter cell line was used to compare retinoid activation levels. Results from ex vivo skin found that RP and ROL have higher penetration levels compared with RPalm. RP is metabolized primarily into ROL in the viable epidermis and dermis whereas ROL is esterified into RPalm and metabolized into the inactive retinoid 14-hydroxy-4,14-retro-retinol (14-HRR). RP treatment yielded higher RARα activation and HA synthesis levels than ROL whereas RPalm had a null effect.

Transient gene activation can have a lasting effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of interferon γ (IFNγ)-induced priming of human cells. We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFNγ-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFNγ-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.","['Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'DNA transcription']"
650,33115807,"Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in solid tumors and is strongly linked to hallmarks of cancer. Recent evidence has shown that hypoxia promotes local immune suppression. Type I IFN supports cytotoxic T lymphocytes by stimulating the maturation of dendritic cells and enhancing their capacity to process and present antigens. However, little is known about the relationship between hypoxia and the type I IFN pathway, which comprises the sensing of double-stranded RNA and DNA (dsRNA/dsDNA) followed by IFNα/β secretion and transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). In this study, we determined the effects of hypoxia on the type I IFN pathway in breast cancer and the mechanisms involved. In cancer cell lines and xenograft models, mRNA and protein expressions of the type I IFN pathway were downregulated under hypoxic conditions. This pathway was suppressed at each level of signaling, from the dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, the adaptor MAVS, transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and STAT1, and several ISG including RIG-I, IRF7, STAT1, and ADAR-p150. Importantly, IFN secretion was reduced under hypoxic conditions. HIF1α- and HIF2α-mediated regulation of gene expression did not explain most of the effects. However, ATAC-seq data revealed in hypoxia that peaks with STAT1 and IRF3 motifs had decreased accessibility. Collectively, these results indicate that hypoxia leads to an overall downregulation of the type I IFN pathway due to repressed transcription and lower chromatin accessibility in an HIF1/2α-independent manner, which could contribute to immunosuppression in hypoxic tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings characterize a new mechanism of immunosuppression by hypoxia via downregulation of the type I IFN pathway and its autocrine/paracrine effects on tumor growth.","['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3', 'Interferon Type I', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Tumor Hypoxia', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Tumor annotation', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
651,33125891,"A greater understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation is required for dissecting protective versus detrimental immunity to pathogens that cause chronic infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We have shown that systemic administration of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or β-glucan reprograms HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) via a type II interferon (IFN-II) or interleukin-1 (IL1) response, respectively, which confers protective trained immunity against Mtb. Here, we demonstrate that, unlike BCG or β-glucan, Mtb reprograms HSCs via an IFN-I response that suppresses myelopoiesis and impairs development of protective trained immunity to Mtb. Mechanistically, IFN-I signaling dysregulates iron metabolism, depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential, and induces cell death specifically in myeloid progenitors. Additionally, activation of the IFN-I/iron axis in HSCs impairs trained immunity to Mtb infection. These results identify an unanticipated immune evasion strategy of Mtb in the BM that controls the magnitude and intrinsic anti-microbial capacity of innate immunity to infection.","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Homeostasis', 'Immunity', 'Interferon Type I', 'Iron', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Macrophages', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Necrosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tuberculosis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Epistasis', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Reaction data', 'Mice or rats', 'Cell type accession', 'Prosite accession number', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
652,33139490,"Vertical transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV) causes severe fetal defects, but the exact pathogenic mechanism is unclear. We identified up to a 10,480-fold higher expression of viral attachment factors <i>AXL</i>, <i>GAS6</i>, and <i>PROS1</i> and a 3880-fold increase in ZIKV infectiousness/propagation in human term decidual stromal cells versus trophoblasts. Moreover, levels of viral attachment factors and ZIKV are significantly increased, whereas expression of innate immune response genes are significantly decreased, in human first trimester versus term decidual cells. ZIKV-infected decidual cell supernatants increased cytotrophoblasts infection up to 252-fold compared with directly infected cytotrophoblasts. Tizoxanide treatment efficiently inhibited Zika infection in both maternal and fetal cells. We conclude that ZIKV permissiveness, as well as innate immune responsiveness of human decidual cells, are gestational age dependent, and decidual cells augment ZIKV infection of primary human cytotrophoblast cultures, which are otherwise ZIKV resistant. Human decidual cells may act as reservoirs for trimester-dependent placental transmission of ZIKV, accounting for the higher Zika infection susceptibility and more severe fetal sequelae observed in early versus late pregnancy.

653,33147208,"Interferon β (IFN-β) is a cytokine that induces a global antiviral proteome, and regulates the adaptive immune response to infections and tumors. Its effects strongly depend on its level and timing of expression. Therefore, the transcription of its coding gene IFNB1 is strictly controlled. We have previously shown that in mice, the TRIM33 protein restrains Ifnb1 transcription in activated myeloid cells through an upstream inhibitory sequence called ICE. Here, we show that the deregulation of Ifnb1 expression observed in murine Trim33-/- macrophages correlates with abnormal looping of both ICE and the Ifnb1 gene to a 100 kb downstream region overlapping the Ptplad2/Hacd4 gene. This region is a predicted myeloid super-enhancer in which we could characterize 3 myeloid-specific active enhancers, one of which (E5) increases the response of the Ifnb1 promoter to activation. In humans, the orthologous region contains several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with decreased expression of IFNB1 in activated monocytes, and loops to the IFNB1 gene. The strongest association is found for the rs12553564 SNP, located in the E5 orthologous region. The minor allele of rs12553564 disrupts a conserved C/EBP-β binding motif, prevents binding of C/EBP-β, and abolishes the activation-induced enhancer activity of E5. Altogether, these results establish a link between a genetic variant preventing binding of a transcription factor and a higher order phenotype, and suggest that the frequent minor allele (around 30% worldwide) might be associated with phenotypes regulated by IFN-β expression in myeloid cells.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blood Buffy Coat', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Transcription Factors']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Small molecules', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Beta diversity data', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cell type accession', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
654,33148793,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) induces a profound host shutoff during lytic infection. The virion host shutoff (<i>vhs</i>) protein plays a key role in this process by efficiently cleaving host and viral mRNAs. Furthermore, the onset of viral DNA replication is accompanied by a rapid decline in host transcriptional activity. To dissect relative contributions of both mechanisms and elucidate gene-specific host transcriptional responses throughout the first 8 h of lytic HSV-1 infection, we used transcriptome sequencing of total, newly transcribed (4sU-labeled) and chromatin-associated RNA in wild-type (WT) and Δ<i>vhs</i> mutant infection of primary human fibroblasts. Following virus entry, <i>vhs</i> activity rapidly plateaued at an elimination rate of around 30% of cellular mRNAs per hour until 8 h postinfection (p.i.). In parallel, host transcriptional activity dropped to 10 to 20%. While the combined effects of both phenomena dominated infection-induced changes in total RNA, extensive gene-specific transcriptional regulation was observable in chromatin-associated RNA and was surprisingly concordant between WT and Δ<i>vhs</i> infections. Both induced strong transcriptional upregulation of a small subset of genes that were poorly expressed prior to infection but already primed by H3K4me3 histone marks at their promoters. Most interestingly, analysis of chromatin-associated RNA revealed <i>vhs</i>-nuclease-activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of at least 150 cellular genes, in particular of many integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix components. This was accompanied by a <i>vhs</i>-dependent reduction in protein levels by 8 h p.i. for many of these genes. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms that govern cellular RNA metabolism during the first 8 h of lytic HSV-1 infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The HSV-1 virion host shutoff (<i>vhs</i>) protein efficiently cleaves both host and viral mRNAs in a translation-dependent manner. In this study, we model and quantify changes in <i>vhs</i> activity, as well as virus-induced global loss of host transcriptional activity, during productive HSV-1 infection. In general, HSV-1-induced alterations in total RNA levels were dominated by these two global effects. In contrast, chromatin-associated RNA depicted gene-specific transcriptional changes. This revealed highly concordant transcriptional changes in WT and <i>Δvhs</i> infections, confirmed DUX4 as a key transcriptional regulator in HSV-1 infection, and identified <i>vhs</i>-dependent transcriptional downregulation of the integrin adhesome and extracellular matrix components. The latter explained seemingly gene-specific effects previously attributed to <i>vhs</i>-mediated mRNA degradation and resulted in a concordant loss in protein levels by 8 h p.i. for many of the respective genes.","['Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human', 'Humans', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteome', 'RNA, Viral', 'Ribonucleases', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication']","['BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Protein complex', 'EMBOSS simple format', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA central ID', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Rare diseases', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Virus annotation', 'Virus identifier']"

The origin of LAM cells is still unknown. Here, we profile a LAM lung compared to an age- and sex-matched healthy control lung as a hypothesis-generating approach to identify cell subtypes that are specific to LAM. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals novel mesenchymal and transitional alveolar epithelial states unique to LAM lung. This analysis identifies a mesenchymal cell hub coordinating the LAM disease phenotype. Mesenchymal-restricted deletion of Tsc2 in the mouse lung produces a mTORC1-driven pulmonary phenotype, with a progressive disruption of alveolar structure, a decline in pulmonary function, increase of rapamycin-sensitive expression of WNT ligands, and profound female-specific changes in mesenchymal and epithelial lung cell gene expression. Genetic inactivation of WNT signaling reverses age-dependent changes of mTORC1-driven lung phenotype, but WNT activation alone in lung mesenchyme is not sufficient for the development of mouse LAM-like phenotype. The alterations in gene expression are driven by distinctive crosstalk between mesenchymal and epithelial subsets of cells observed in mesenchymal Tsc2-deficient lungs.

Notwithstanding, the effect of other lupin components on carbohydrate metabolism, including β-conglutin protein, has received little attention. Here, we investigated the influence of the acute and chronic administration of β-conglutin on glycaemia modulation in normal and streptozotocin induced-to-diabetes rats. We analysed the liver transcriptome modulation exerted by β-conglutin in diabetes-induced rats using DNA microarrays to scout for potential molecular targets and pathways involved in this biological response. The acute administration of β-conglutin reduced the incremental area under the curve of glycaemia in normal and diabetes-induced animals. In a seven-day study with diabetic animals, glycaemia increased significantly in non-treated animals but remained unchanged in animals treated with a daily dose of β-conglutin. Total cholesterol was significantly lower at the end of the experimental period (-21.8 %, p = 0.039). The microarray and gene ontology analyses revealed several targets and pathways potentially modulated by β-conglutin treatment, including a possible down-regulation of Jun kinase activity. Moreover, our data indicate that targets related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and estrogenic activity might orchestrate these metabolic effects.

Moreover, we provide evidence that IL2 differentially affects homeostasis of iNKT subsets with iNKT17 cells engaging a unique mechanism to respond to IL2 by initiating a slow rate of proliferation.","['Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cytokines', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunosenescence', 'Interleukin-2', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells', 'Phenotype', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transcriptome', 'src-Family Kinases']","['Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Natural product identification', 'Natural language processing', 'NLP format', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'ELAND format', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Gene family report']"

Application of this approach in LPS treated mice uncovers microglia-specific transcriptome and epigenome changes in inflammatory pathways that cannot be detected with tissue-level analysis.

In particular, granules found in germ cells have been used as a paradigm to study large and dynamic granules. These germ granules contain RNA and proteins required for germline development. Here, we unexpectedly identify large granules in specific subtypes of glial cells (""glial granules"") of the adult Drosophila brain which contain polypeptides with previously characterized roles in germ cells including scaffold Tudor, Vasa, Polar granule component and Piwi family proteins. Interestingly, our super-resolution microscopy analysis shows that in the glial granules, these proteins form distinct partially overlapping clusters. Furthermore, we show that glial granule scaffold protein Tudor functions in silencing of transposable elements and in small regulatory piRNA biogenesis. Remarkably, our data indicate that the adult brain contains a small population of cells, which express both neuroblast and germ cell proteins. These distinct cells are evolutionarily conserved and expand during aging suggesting the existence of age-dependent signaling.

RNA-seq-generated transcript levels were compared as follows: (i) prfA* and WT; (ii) WT and ∆prfA and (iii) prfA* and ∆prfA. Significantly higher transcript levels in the induced WT or constitutively active PrfA* were identified for 18 genes and 2 ncRNAs in at least one of the three comparisons.

Limited understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying CPB-associated inflammation presents a significant barrier to improve clinical outcomes. To better understand these clinical issues, we performed mRNA sequencing on total circulating leukocytes from neonatal patients undergoing CPB. Our data identify myeloid cells, particularly monocytes, as the major cell type driving transcriptional responses to CPB. Furthermore, IL-8 and TNF-α were inflammatory cytokines robustly upregulated in leukocytes from both patients and piglets exposed to CPB. To delineate the molecular mechanism, we exposed THP-1 human monocytic cells to CPB-like conditions, including artificial surfaces, high shear stress, and cooling/rewarming. Shear stress was found to drive cytokine upregulation via calcium-dependent signaling pathways. We also observed that a subpopulation of THP-1 cells died via TNF-α-mediated necroptosis, which we hypothesize contributes to post-CPB inflammation. Our study identifies a shear stress-modulated molecular mechanism that drives systemic inflammation in pediatric CPB patients. These are also the first data to our knowledge to demonstrate that shear stress causes necroptosis.

We show that diverse mutations affect different aspects of protein activity but lead to shared deficiencies in neuronal DNA methylation. Heterozygous DNMT3A knockout mice mimicking DNMT3A disruption in disease display growth and behavioral alterations consistent with human phenotypes. Strikingly, in these mice, we detect global disruption of neuron-enriched non-CG DNA methylation, a binding site for the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2. Loss of this methylation leads to enhancer and gene dysregulation that overlaps with models of Rett syndrome and autism.

A total of 253 and 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in whisker follicles and the striatum, respectively. Multivariate and network analyses were performed on these DEGs to find hub genes and key pathways within the constructed network. A total of 129 and 49 genes were finally selected from the DEG sets of whisker follicles and of the striatum. Statistically significant DEGs were found to belong to the classes of genes involved in nicotine addiction, cocaine addiction, and amphetamine addiction in the striatum as well as in Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's diseases in whisker follicles. Of note, several genes and pathways including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and the synaptic vesicle cycle pathway were common between the two tissues.

YAP and WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1; also known as TAZ) regulate a large number of target genes, acting as coactivators of DNA-binding transcription factors or as negative regulators of transcription by interacting with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complexes. YAP is expressed in self-renewing embryonic stem cells (ESCs), although it is still debated whether it plays any crucial roles in the control of either stemness or differentiation. Here we show that the transient downregulation of YAP in mouse ESCs perturbs cellular homeostasis, leading to the inability to differentiate properly. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that this transient knockdown caused a genome-wide alteration of the DNA methylation remodeling that takes place during the early steps of differentiation, suggesting that the phenotype we observed might be due to the dysregulation of some of the mechanisms involved in regulation of ESC exit from pluripotency. By gene expression analysis, we identified two molecules that could have a role in the altered genome-wide methylation profile: the long noncoding RNA ephemeron, whose rapid upregulation is crucial for the transition of ESCs into epiblast, and the methyltransferase-like protein Dnmt3l, which, during the embryo development, cooperates with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to contribute to the de novo DNA methylation that governs early steps of ESC differentiation.

Seven conjunctival SCC, seven Pap and ten Ctrl were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and analyzed using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) clusters were explored and the abundance of involved cell types was quantified by xCell. Finally, a classification model was developed to distinguish SCC from Pap and Ctrl. Among the most prominent DEG in SCC a plethora of keratins were upregulated when compared to Pap and Ctrl. xCell analysis revealed an enrichment of immune cells, including activated dendritic cells and T-helper type 1 cells (Th1), in SCC when compared to Ctrl. The generated classification model could reliably discriminate between the three entities according to the expression pattern of 30 factors. This study provides a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of rare conjunctival SCC. The analysis identifies distinct keratins, as well as dendritic and Th1 cells as important mediators in SCC.

The pathological features underlying NPC are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in acidic compartments, including late endosomes and lysosomes. Due to the inaccessibility of brain tissues from human NPC patients, we developed NPC brain organoids with induced neural stem cells from NPC patient-derived fibroblasts. NPC organoids exhibit significantly reduced size and proliferative ability, which are accompanied by accumulation of cholesterol, impairment in neuronal differentiation, and autophagic flux and dysfunction of lysosomes; therefore, NPC organoids can recapitulate the main phenotypes of NPC patients. Furthermore, these pathological phenotypes observed in NPC organoids were reversed by treatment with valproic acid and HPBCD, which are known to be an effective treatment for several neurodegenerative diseases. Our data present patient-specific phenotypes in 3D organoid-based models of NPC and highlight the application of this model to drug screening in vitro.","['Autophagy', 'Biomarkers', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neural Stem Cells', 'Neurons', 'Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C', 'Organoids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Valproic Acid']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Count matrix', 'Ion counting', 'Spectral counting', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structural data', 'Structure clustering', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'Organism report', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid report']"
679,33318687,"The cohesin complex has an essential role in maintaining genome organization. However, its role in gene regulation remains largely unresolved. Here we report that the cohesin release factor WAPL creates a pool of free cohesin, in a process known as cohesin turnover, which reloads it to cell-type-specific binding sites. Paradoxically, stabilization of cohesin binding, following WAPL ablation, results in depletion of cohesin from these cell-type-specific regions, loss of gene expression and differentiation. Chromosome conformation capture experiments show that cohesin turnover is important for maintaining promoter-enhancer loops. Binding of cohesin to cell-type-specific sites is dependent on the pioneer transcription factors OCT4 (POU5F1) and SOX2, but not NANOG. We show the importance of cohesin turnover in controlling transcription and propose that a cycle of cohesin loading and off-loading, instead of static cohesin binding, mediates promoter and enhancer interactions critical for gene regulation.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Mouse clinic', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein domains', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

We use nascent transcript analysis to show that RNA polymerase II loads within 10 bp of the G/T transversion site, definitively establishing enhancer function for the region. By integrating Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis of fresh and cultured human airway epithelial cells with nuclease sensitivity data, we demonstrate that this region is in accessible chromatin that affects the expression of MUC5B. Through applying paired single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-seq to frozen tissue from IPF lungs, we extend these findings directly to disease, with results indicating that epigenetic programming of the -3 kb enhancer in IPF occurs in both MUC5B-expressing and nonexpressing lineages.

Most very preterm infants are exposed to chorioamnionitis, but short- and long-term effects of ACS treatment in this setting are not well defined. In low-resource settings, ACS increased neonatal mortality by perhaps increasing infection. We report that treatment with low-dose ACS in the setting of inflammation induced by intraamniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rhesus macaques improves lung compliance and increases surfactant production relative to either exposure alone. RNA sequencing shows that these changes are mediated by suppression of proliferation and induction of mesenchymal cellular death via TP53. The combined exposure results in a mature-like transcriptomic profile with inhibition of extracellular matrix development by suppression of collagen genes COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 and regulators of lung development FGF9 and FGF10. ACS and inflammation also suppressed signature genes associated with proliferative mesenchymal progenitors similar to the term gestation lung.

We implemented a comprehensive molecular systems biology approach, combining statistical tools, such as MicroRNA Master Regulator Analysis pipeline and Boolean modeling to integrate these biochemical processes. We demonstrated that EPA mediated molecular adaptations, leading to the inhibition of miR-34a-5p, a negative regulator of Irs2 as a master regulatory event leading to the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by insulin during the fasting-feeding transition.

684,33363531,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by infiltration of immune cells into granulomas. Previous gene expression studies using heterogeneous cell mixtures lack insight into cell-type-specific immune dysregulation. We performed the first single-cell RNA-sequencing study of sarcoidosis in peripheral immune cells in 48 patients and controls. Following unbiased clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified for 18 cell types and bioinformatically assessed for function and pathway enrichment. Our results reveal persistent activation of circulating classical monocytes with subsequent upregulation of trafficking molecules. Specifically, classical monocytes upregulated distinct markers of activation including adhesion molecules, pattern recognition receptors, and chemokine receptors, as well as enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways HMGB1, mTOR, and ephrin receptor signaling. Predictive modeling implicated TGFβ and mTOR signaling as drivers of persistent monocyte activation. Additionally, sarcoidosis T cell subsets displayed patterns of dysregulation. CD4 naïve T cells were enriched for markers of apoptosis and Th17/T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation, while effector T cells showed enrichment of anergy-related pathways. Differentially expressed genes in regulatory T cells suggested dysfunctional p53, cell death, and TNFR2 signaling. Using more sensitive technology and more precise units of measure, we identify cell-type specific, novel inflammatory and regulatory pathways. Based on our findings, we suggest a novel model involving four convergent arms of dysregulation: persistent hyperactivation of innate and adaptive immunity <i>via</i> classical monocytes and CD4 naïve T cells, regulatory T cell dysfunction, and effector T cell anergy.

In contrast, mutating key amino acids in histone deacetylase (HDAC) domain in Tcf1 resulted in CTLA4 derepression in T<sub>FH</sub> cells.

689,33411704,"The nuclear protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has diverse roles in chromatin architecture and gene regulation. Functionally, CTCF associates with thousands of genomic sites and interacts with proteins, such as cohesin, or non-coding RNAs to facilitate specific transcriptional programming. In this study, we examined CTCF during the cellular stress response in human primary cells using immune-blotting, quantitative real time-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence (ChIP-seq) analysis, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis (RIP-seq), and Airyscan confocal microscopy. Unexpectedly, we found that CTCF is exquisitely sensitive to diverse forms of stress in normal patient-derived human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). In HMECs, a subset of CTCF protein forms complexes that localize to Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SC-35)-containing nuclear speckles. Upon stress, this species of CTCF protein is rapidly downregulated by changes in protein stability, resulting in loss of CTCF from SC-35 nuclear speckles and changes in CTCF-RNA interactions. Our ChIP-seq analysis indicated that CTCF binding to genomic DNA is largely unchanged. Restoration of the stress-sensitive pool of CTCF protein abundance and re-localization to nuclear speckles can be achieved by inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation. Surprisingly, we observed the same characteristics of the stress response during neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). CTCF forms stress-sensitive complexes that localize to SC-35 nuclear speckles during a specific stage of neuronal commitment/development but not in differentiated neurons. We speculate that these particular CTCF complexes serve a role in RNA processing that may be intimately linked with specific genes in the vicinity of nuclear speckles, potentially to maintain cells in a certain differentiation state, that is dynamically regulated by environmental signals. The stress-regulated activity of CTCF is uncoupled in persistently stressed, epigenetically re-programmed ""variant"" HMECs and certain cancer cell lines.

693,33450187,"Lack of cellular differentiation is a hallmark of many human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Strategies to overcome such a differentiation blockade are an approach for treating AML. To identify targets for differentiation-based therapies, we applied an integrated cell surface-based CRISPR platform to assess genes involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of leukemia cells. Here we identify the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 as a critical regulator of AML maintenance and differentiation. Mechanistically, ZFP36L2 interacts with the 3' untranslated region of key myeloid maturation genes, including the ZFP36 paralogs, to promote their mRNA degradation and suppress terminal myeloid cell differentiation. Genetic inhibition of ZFP36L2 restores the mRNA stability of these targeted transcripts and ultimately triggers myeloid differentiation in leukemia cells. Epigenome profiling of several individuals with primary AML revealed enhancer modules near ZFP36L2 that associated with distinct AML cell states, establishing a coordinated epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanism that shapes leukemic differentiation.","['Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute']","['Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'Gene cluster', 'Clustering', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine']"

695,33500413,"Telomeres are organized into a heterochromatin structure and maintenance of silent heterochromatin is required for chromosome stability. How telomere heterochromatin is dynamically regulated in response to stimuli remains unknown. Pyruvate kinase Pyk1 forms a complex named SESAME (Serine-responsive SAM-containing Metabolic Enzyme complex) to regulate gene expression by phosphorylating histone H3T11 (H3pT11). Here, we identify a function of SESAME in regulating telomere heterochromatin structure. SESAME phosphorylates H3T11 at telomeres, which maintains SIR (silent information regulator) complex occupancy at telomeres and protects Sir2 from degradation by autophagy. Moreover, SESAME-catalyzed H3pT11 directly represses autophagy-related gene expression to further prevent autophagy-mediated Sir2 degradation. By promoting H3pT11, serine increases Sir2 protein levels and enhances telomere silencing. Loss of H3pT11 leads to reduced Sir2 and compromised telomere silencing during chronological aging. Together, our study provides insights into dynamic regulation of silent heterochromatin by histone modifications and autophagy in response to cell metabolism and aging.","['Autophagy', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Heterochromatin', 'Histones', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteolysis', 'Pyruvate Kinase', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Serine', 'Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sirtuin 2', 'Telomere']","['Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Histogram', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein cleavage sites and proteolysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Kinase name', 'Date', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Veterinary medicine', 'Marine biology', 'Sequence visualisation', 'Proteins', 'Protein interaction format', 'Gene regulation']"

As such, compounds that target HDACs or drugs that target epigenetic markers may be potential candidates for cancer therapy. This study was therefore aimed to identify a potential epidrug with low toxicity and high efficiency as anti-tumor agents. <b>Methods</b>: We first screened an epigenetic small molecule inhibitor library to screen for an epidrug for breast cancer. The candidate was identified as PCI-24781 and was characterized for half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>), for specificity to breast cancer cells, and for effects on carcinogenesis and metastatic properties of breast cancer cell lines <i>in vitro</i>. A series of in silico and <i>in vitro</i> analyses were further performed of PCI-24781 to identify and understand its target. <b>Results</b>: Screening of an epigenetic inhibitor library in MDA-MB-231 cells, a malignant cancer cell line, showed that PCI-24781 is a potential anti-tumor drug specific to breast cancer. Ca<sup>2+</sup> related pathways were identified as a potential target of PCI-24781. Further analyses showed that PCI-24781 inhibited Gαq-PLCβ3-mediated calcium signaling by activating the expression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) to reduce cell proliferation, metastasis, and differentiation, resulting in cell death in breast cancer. In addition, RGS2 depletion reversed anti-tumor effect and inhibition of calcium influx induced by PCI-24781 treatment in breast cancer cells. <b>Conclusions</b>: We have demonstrated that PCI-24781 is an effective anti-tumor therapeutic agent that targets calcium signaling by activating RGS2.

698,33506534,"In mammals, DNA methylation is associated with aging. However, age-related DNA methylation changes during phase transitions largely remain unstudied in plants. Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) requires a very long time to transition from the vegetative to the floral phase. To comprehensively investigate the association of DNA methylation with aging, we present here single-base-resolution DNA methylation profiles using both high-throughput bisulfite sequencing and single-molecule nanopore-based DNA sequencing, covering the long period of vegetative growth and transition to flowering in moso bamboo. We discovered that CHH methylation gradually accumulates from vegetative to reproductive growth in a time-dependent fashion. Differentially methylated regions, correlating with chronological aging, occurred preferentially at both transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. Genes with CG methylation changes showed an enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) categories in 'vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem'. Combining methylation data with mRNA sequencing revealed that DNA methylation in promoters, introns and exons may have different roles in regulating gene expression. Finally, circular RNA (circRNA) sequencing revealed that the flanking introns of circRNAs are hypermethylated and enriched in long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Together, the observations in this study provide insights into the dynamic DNA methylation and circRNA landscapes, correlating with chronological age, which paves the way to study further the impact of epigenetic factors on flowering in moso bamboo.","['Aging', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Flowers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Poaceae', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Plant', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","['Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Transposon prediction', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Power test', 'Primers', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'CD spectra', 'Plant biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"

Here, using multiplexed genome editing of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and transplant assays, we developed preclinical models of AEL and non-erythroid acute leukemia and describe the central role of mutational cooperativity in determining leukemia lineage. Different combination of mutations in Trp53, Bcor, Dnmt3a, Rb1, and Nfix resulted in the development of leukemia with an erythroid phenotype, accompanied by the acquisition of alterations in signaling and transcription factor genes that recapitulate human AEL by cross-species genomic analysis. Clonal expansion during tumor evolution was driven by mutational cooccurrence, with clones harboring a higher number of founder and secondary lesions (eg, mutations in signaling genes) showing greater evolutionary fitness. Mouse and human AEL exhibited deregulation of genes regulating erythroid development, notably Gata1, Klf1, and Nfe2, driven by the interaction of mutations of the epigenetic modifiers Dnmt3a and Tet2 that perturbed methylation and thus expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. The established mouse leukemias were used as a platform for drug screening. Drug sensitivity was associated with the leukemia genotype, with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor talazoparib and the demethylating agent decitabine efficacious in Trp53/Bcor-mutant AEL, CDK7/9 inhibitors in Trp53/Bcor/Dnmt3a-mutant AEL, and gemcitabine and bromodomain inhibitors in NUP98-KDM5A leukemia.

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses showed that L-Myc and c-Myc impart neuronal and non-neuroendocrine-associated transcriptional programs, respectively, both associated with distinct SCLC lineage. Genetic replacement of c-Myc with L-Myc in c-Myc-SCLC induced a neuronal state but was insufficient to induce ASCL1-SCLC.

Using lineage tracing and single-cell sequencing in EAE, we determined that the majority of the fibrotic scar is derived from proliferative CNS fibroblasts, not pericytes or infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells. Ablating proliferating fibrotic cells using cell-specific expression of herpes thymidine kinase led to an increase in oligodendrocyte lineage cells within the inflammatory lesions and a reduction in motor disability. We further identified that interferon-gamma pathway genes are enriched in CNS fibrotic cells, and the fibrotic cell-specific deletion of Ifngr1 resulted in reduced fibrotic scarring in EAE. These data delineate a framework for understanding the CNS fibrotic response.","['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Mice', 'Neutrophil Infiltration', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Spinal Cord']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain identifier', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Prosite accession number', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Information extraction', 'Dendrogram visualisation', 'Dendrograph plotting', 'ClustalW dendrogram', 'Report', 'Data', 'Sequence record']"

To eradicate LSCs, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying their heterogeneity. Here, we aimed to identify signals responsible for heterogeneity and variation of LSCs in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Monitoring expression levels of endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), a hematopoietic stem cell-related marker, was useful to detect the plasticity of AML cells. While healthy human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells robustly expressed ESAM, AML cells exhibited heterogeneous ESAM expression. Interestingly, ESAM<sup>-</sup> and ESAM<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells obtained from AML patients were mutually interconvertible in culture. KG1a and CMK, human AML clones, also represented the heterogeneity in terms of ESAM expression. Single cell culture with ESAM<sup>-</sup> or ESAM<sup>+</sup> AML clones recapitulated the phenotypic interconversion. The phenotypic alteration was regulated at the gene expression level, and RNA sequencing revealed activation of TGFβ signaling in these cells. AML cells secreted TGFβ1, which autonomously activated TGFβ pathway and induced their phenotypic variation. Surprisingly, TGFβ signaling blockade inhibited not only the variation but also the proliferation of AML cells. Therefore, autonomous activation of TGFβ signaling underlies the LSC heterogeneity, which may be a promising therapeutic target for AML.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

We demonstrate that Isw2-recruiting factors use small and previously uncharacterized epitopes, which direct Isw2 activity through highly conserved acidic residues in the Isw2 accessory protein Itc1. This interaction orients Isw2 on target nucleosomes, allowing for precise nucleosome positioning at targeted loci. Finally, we show that these critical acidic residues have been lost in the <i>Drosophila</i> lineage, potentially explaining the inconsistently characterized function of Isw2-like proteins.

704,33602783,"NSD2 is the primary oncogenic driver in t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Using SILAC-based mass spectrometry, we demonstrate a novel role of NSD2 in chromatin remodeling through its interaction with the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit SMARCA2. SMARCA2 was primarily expressed in t(4;14) myeloma cells, and its interaction with NSD2 was noncanonical and independent of the SWI/SNF complex. RNA sequencing identified PTP4A3 as a downstream target of NSD2 and mapped NSD2-SMARCA2 complex on PTP4A3 promoter. This led to a focal increase in the permissive H3K36me2 mark and transcriptional activation of PTP4A3. High levels of PTP4A3 maintained MYC expression and correlated with a 54-gene MYC signature in t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Importantly, this mechanism was druggable by targeting the bromodomain of SMARCA2 using the specific BET inhibitor PFI-3, leading to the displacement of NSD2 from PTP4A3 promoter and inhibiting t(4;14) myeloma cell viability. <i>In vivo</i>, treatment with PFI-3 reduced the growth of t(4;14) xenograft tumors. Together, our study reveals an interplay between histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodelers in the regulation of myeloma-specific genes that can be clinically intervened.

Here, we demonstrated that the histone variant H2A.Z is highly expressed in PDAC cell lines and PDAC patients and that its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. Moreover, all three H2A.Z isoforms (H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2.1, and H2A.Z.2.2) are highly expressed in PDAC cell lines and PDAC patients. Knockdown of these H2A.Z isoforms in PDAC cell lines induces a senescent phenotype, cell cycle arrest in phase G2/M, increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A/p16, SA-β-galactosidase activity and interleukin 8 production. Transcriptome analysis of H2A.Z-depleted PDAC cells showed altered gene expression in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and those that regulate cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Importantly, depletion of H2A.Z isoforms reduces the tumor size in a mouse xenograft model in vivo and sensitizes PDAC cells to gemcitabine. Overexpression of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2.1 more than H2A.Z.2.2 partially restores the oncogenic phenotype.

Here, we show that bladder cancer (BCa) cell-secreted EVs mediated intercellular communication with human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) through transmission of the long noncoding RNA ELNAT1 and promoted lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis in a SUMOylation-dependent manner in both cultured BCa cell lines and mouse models. Mechanistically, ELNAT1 induced UBC9 overexpression to catalyze the SUMOylation of hnRNPA1 at the lysine 113 residue, which mediated recognition of ELNAT1 by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and facilitated its packaging into EVs. EV-mediated ELNAT1 was specifically transmitted into HLECs and epigenetically activated SOX18 transcription to induce lymphangiogenesis. Importantly, blocking the SUMOylation of tumor cells by downregulating UBC9 expression markedly reduced lymphatic metastasis in EV-mediated, ELNAT1-treated BCa in vivo. Clinically, EV-mediated ELNAT1 was correlated with LN metastasis and a poor prognosis for patients with BCa. These findings highlight a molecular mechanism whereby the EV-mediated ELNAT1/UBC9/SOX18 regulatory axis promotes lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis in BCa in a SUMOylation-dependent manner and implicate ELNAT1 as an attractive therapeutic target for LN metastatic BCa.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Vesicles', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Sumoylation', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Data retrieval', 'Feature extraction', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Epistasis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'Coding region', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA methylation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Relation extraction', 'Binary format']"
710,33665945,"Male and female gametocytes are sexual precursor cells essential for mosquito transmission of malaria parasite. Differentiation of gametocytes into fertile gametes (known as gametogenesis) relies on the gender-specific transcription program. How the parasites establish distinct repertoires of transcription in the male and female gametocytes remains largely unknown. Here, we report that an Apetala2 family transcription factor AP2-O3 operates as a transcription repressor in the female gametocytes. AP2-O3 is specifically expressed in the female gametocytes. AP2-O3-deficient parasites produce apparently normal female gametocytes. Nevertheless, these gametocytes fail to differentiate into fully fertile female gametes, leading to developmental arrest in fertilization and early development post-fertilization. AP2-O3 disruption causes massive upregulation of transcriptionally dormant male genes and simultaneously downregulation of highly transcribed female genes in the female gametocytes. AP2-O3 targets a substantial proportion of the male genes by recognizing an 8-base DNA motif. In addition, the maternal AP2-O3 is removed after fertilization, which is required for the zygote to ookinete development. Therefore, the global transcriptional repression of the male genes in the female gametocytes is required for safeguarding female-specific transcriptome and essential for the mosquito transmission of Plasmodium.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Gametogenesis', 'Male', 'Plasmodium berghei', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Protozoan Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'MAT', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Plasmid map', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

Here, we identify Creb5 as a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in superficial zone articular chondrocytes and is required for TGF-β and EGFR signaling to induce Prg4 expression. Notably, forced expression of Creb5 in chondrocytes derived from the deep zone of the articular cartilage confers the competence for TGF-β and EGFR signals to induce Prg4 expression. Chromatin-IP and ATAC-Seq analyses have revealed that Creb5 directly binds to two Prg4 promoter-proximal regulatory elements, that display an open chromatin conformation specifically in superficial zone articular chondrocytes; and which work in combination with a more distal regulatory element to drive induction of Prg4 by TGF-β.

714,33752799,"Immunity to malaria is often considered slow to develop but this only applies to defense mechanisms that function to eliminate parasites (resistance). In contrast, immunity to severe disease can be acquired quickly and without the need for improved pathogen control (tolerance). Using <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i>, we show that a single malaria episode is sufficient to induce host adaptations that can minimise inflammation, prevent tissue damage and avert endothelium activation, a hallmark of severe disease. Importantly, monocytes are functionally reprogrammed to prevent their differentiation into inflammatory macrophages and instead promote mechanisms of stress tolerance to protect their niche. This alternative fate is not underpinned by epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow progenitors but appears to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen. Crucially, all of these adaptations operate independently of pathogen load and limit the damage caused by malaria parasites in subsequent infections. Acquired immunity to malaria therefore prioritises host fitness over pathogen clearance.","['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Host Adaptation', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Inflammation', 'Macrophages', 'Malaria', 'Malaria, Falciparum', 'Monocytes', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Plasmodium chabaudi', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Spleen']","['DNA barcoding', 'Peptide immunogenicity data', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'GEN']"
715,33766890,"Melanoma occurs as a consequence of inherited susceptibility to the disease and exposure to UV radiation (UVR) and is characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation and a high mutational load. The precise mechanisms by which UVR contributes to the development of melanoma remain poorly understood. Here we show that activation of nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3) promotes melanomagenesis through regulation of UVR sensitivity, cell-cycle progression, and circumvention of the DNA damage response (DDR). Downregulation of NCOA3 expression, either by genetic silencing or small-molecule inhibition, significantly suppressed melanoma proliferation in melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. NCOA3 silencing suppressed expression of xeroderma pigmentosum C and increased melanoma cell sensitivity to UVR. Suppression of NCOA3 expression led to activation of DDR effectors and reduced expression of cyclin B1, resulting in G<sub>2</sub>-M arrest and mitotic catastrophe. A SNP in NCOA3 (T960T) reduced NCOA3 protein expression and was associated with decreased melanoma risk, given a significantly lower prevalence in a familial melanoma cohort than in a control cohort without cancer. Overexpression of wild-type NCOA3 promoted melanocyte survival following UVR and was accompanied by increased levels of UVR-induced DNA damage, both of which were attenuated by overexpression of NCOA3 (T960T). These results describe NCOA3-regulated pathways by which melanoma can develop, with germline NCOA3 polymorphisms enabling enhanced melanocyte survival in the setting of UVR exposure, despite an increased mutational burden. They also identify NCOA3 as a novel therapeutic target for melanoma.

Here we show that MYCN activates Aurora-A on chromatin, which phosphorylates histone H3 at serine 10 in S phase, promotes the deposition of histone H3.3 and suppresses R-loop formation. Inhibition of Aurora-A induces transcription-replication conflicts and activates the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase, which limits double-strand break accumulation upon Aurora-A inhibition. Combined inhibition of Aurora-A and ATR induces rampant tumor-specific apoptosis and tumor regression in mouse models of neuroblastoma, leading to permanent eradication in a subset of mice. The therapeutic efficacy is due to both tumor cell-intrinsic and immune cell-mediated mechanisms.

717,33780446,"Mitochondria are essential for maintaining skeletal muscle metabolic homeostasis during adaptive response to a myriad of physiologic or pathophysiological stresses. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial function and contractile fiber type are concordantly regulated to ensure muscle function remain poorly understood. Evidence is emerging that the Folliculin interacting protein 1 (Fnip1) is involved in skeletal muscle fiber type specification, function, and disease. In this study, Fnip1 was specifically expressed in skeletal muscle in Fnip1-transgenic (Fnip1Tg) mice. Fnip1Tg mice were crossed with Fnip1-knockout (Fnip1KO) mice to generate Fnip1TgKO mice expressing Fnip1 only in skeletal muscle but not in other tissues. Our results indicate that, in addition to the known role in type I fiber program, FNIP1 exerts control upon muscle mitochondrial oxidative program through AMPK signaling. Indeed, basal levels of FNIP1 are sufficient to inhibit AMPK but not mTORC1 activity in skeletal muscle cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies in mice, together with assessment of primary muscle cells, demonstrated that skeletal muscle mitochondrial program is suppressed via the inhibitory actions of FNIP1 on AMPK. Surprisingly, the FNIP1 actions on type I fiber program is independent of AMPK and its downstream PGC-1α. These studies provide a vital framework for understanding the intrinsic role of FNIP1 as a crucial factor in the concerted regulation of mitochondrial function and muscle fiber type that determine muscle fitness.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria, Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal', 'Organ Specificity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress']","['protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Mitochondria', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data']"

Canine simple mCA represent relevant models of human mCA, notably also with respect to CAS. While transcriptomic changes in CAS of mCA are well described, it remains unclear to what extent these translate to the protein level. Therefore, we sought to gain insight into the proteomic changes in CAS and compare them with transcriptomic changes in the same tissue. To this end, we analyzed CAS and matched normal stroma using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and LC-MS/MS in a cohort of 14 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) canine mCAs that we had previously characterized using LCM-RNAseq. Our results reveal clear differences in protein abundance between CAS and normal stroma, which are characterized by changes in the extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton, and cytokines such as TNF. The proteomics- and RNAseq-based analyses of LCM-FFPE show a substantial degree of correlation, especially for the most deregulated targets and a comparable activation of pathways. Finally, we validate transcriptomic upregulation of LTBP2, IGFBP2, COL6A5, POSTN, FN1, COL4A1, COL12A1, PLOD2, COL4A2, and IGFBP7 in CAS on the protein level and demonstrate their adverse prognostic value for human breast cancer.

Establishing a novel mouse model that reflects the ARID1A heterozygous mutations found in the majority of human GC cases, we demonstrated that Arid1a heterozygosity facilitates tumor progression through a global loss of enhancers and subsequent suppression of the p53 and apoptosis pathways. Moreover, mouse genetic and single-cell analyses demonstrated that the homozygous deletion of Arid1a confers a competitive disadvantage through the activation of the p53 pathway, highlighting its distinct dosage-dependent roles.

727,33878299,"Estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer exhibits a strong bone tropism in metastasis. How the bone microenvironment (BME) impacts ER signaling and endocrine therapy remains poorly understood. Here, we discover that the osteogenic niche transiently and reversibly reduces ER expression and activities specifically in bone micrometastases (BMMs), leading to endocrine resistance. As BMMs progress, the ER reduction and endocrine resistance may partially recover in cancer cells away from the osteogenic niche, creating phenotypic heterogeneity in macrometastases. Using multiple approaches, including an evolving barcoding strategy, we demonstrated that this process is independent of clonal selection, and represents an EZH2-mediated epigenomic reprogramming.

729,33930311,"STAG2, a cohesin family gene, is among the most recurrently mutated genes in cancer. STAG2 loss of function (LOF) is associated with aggressive behavior in Ewing sarcoma, a childhood cancer driven by aberrant transcription induced by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene. Here, using isogenic Ewing cells, we show that, while STAG2 LOF profoundly changes the transcriptome, it does not significantly impact EWSR1-FLI1, CTCF/cohesin, or acetylated H3K27 DNA binding patterns. In contrast, it strongly alters the anchored dynamic loop extrusion process at boundary CTCF sites and dramatically decreases promoter-enhancer interactions, particularly affecting the expression of genes regulated by EWSR1-FLI1 at GGAA microsatellite neo-enhancers. Down-modulation of cis-mediated EWSR1-FLI1 activity, observed in STAG2-LOF conditions, is associated with enhanced migration and invasion properties of Ewing cells previously observed in EWSR1-FLI1<sup>low</sup> cells. Our study illuminates a process whereby STAG2-LOF fine-tunes the activity of an oncogenic transcription factor through altered CTCF-anchored loop extrusion and cis-mediated enhancer mechanisms.","['Bone Neoplasms', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Loss of Function Mutation', 'Lysine', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sarcoma, Ewing']","['Plasmid map', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Mutation ID', 'Protein function prediction', 'Analysis', 'Protein accession', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'DNA barcoding', 'Genome visualisation']"

731,33945509,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly implicated in the pathology of diabetic complications. Here, we examined the role of lncRNAs in monocyte dysfunction and inflammation associated with human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). RNA sequencing analysis of CD14+ monocytes from patients with T2D versus healthy controls revealed downregulation of antiinflammatory and antiproliferative genes, along with several lncRNAs, including a potentially novel divergent lncRNA diabetes regulated antiinflammatory RNA (DRAIR) and its nearby gene CPEB2. High glucose and palmitic acid downregulated DRAIR in cultured CD14+ monocytes, whereas antiinflammatory cytokines and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation upregulated DRAIR via KLF4 transcription factor. DRAIR overexpression increased antiinflammatory and macrophage differentiation genes but inhibited proinflammatory genes. Conversely, DRAIR knockdown attenuated antiinflammatory genes, promoted inflammatory responses, and inhibited phagocytosis. DRAIR regulated target gene expression through interaction with chromatin, as well as inhibition of the repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me2 and its corresponding methyltransferase G9a. Mouse orthologous Drair and Cpeb2 were also downregulated in peritoneal macrophages from T2D db/db mice, and Drair knockdown in nondiabetic mice enhanced proinflammatory genes in macrophages. Thus, DRAIR modulates the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes/macrophages via epigenetic mechanisms, and its downregulation in T2D may promote chronic inflammation. Augmentation of endogenous lncRNAs like DRAIR could serve as novel antiinflammatory therapies for diabetic complications.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Monocytes', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Young Adult']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Cell type accession', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'cel', 'CellML']"

To determine whether a similar BCL-2 upregulation occurs in lapatinib-treated patients, we evaluated gene expression within tumor biopsies, collected before and after lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment, from the TRIO-B-07 clinical trial (NCT#00769470). We detected BCL2 mRNA upregulation in both HER2+/ER- as well as HER2+/ER+ patient tumors treated with lapatinib or trastuzumab. To address whether mRNA expression correlated with protein expression, we evaluated pre- and post-treatment tumors for BCL-2 via immunohistochemistry. Despite BCL2 mRNA upregulation within HER2+/ER- tumors, BCL-2 protein levels were undetectable in most of the lapatinib- or trastuzumab-treated HER2+/ER- tumors. BCL-2 upregulation was evident within the majority of lapatinib-treated HER2+/ER+ tumors and was often coupled with increased ER expression and decreased proliferation. Comparable BCL-2 upregulation was not observed within the trastuzumab-treated HER2+/ER+ tumors.

ROS-mediated oxidation of host membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) generates the toxic alpha-beta carbonyl 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Although studied extensively in the context of sterile inflammation, research into 4-HNE's role during infection remains limited. Here, we found that 4-HNE is generated during bacterial infection, that it impacts growth and survival in a range of bacteria, and that the intracellular pathogen <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> induces many genes in response to 4-HNE exposure. A component of the <i>L. monocytogenes</i> 4-HNE response is the expression of the genes <i>lmo0103</i> and <i>lmo0613,</i> deemed <i>rha1</i> and <i>rha2</i> (<b>r</b>eductase of <b>h</b>ost <b>a</b>lkenals), respectively, which code for two NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that convert 4-HNE to the product 4-hydroxynonanal (4-HNA). Loss of these genes had no impact on <i>L. monocytogenes</i> bacterial burdens during murine or tissue culture infection. However, heterologous expression of <i>rha1/2</i> in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> significantly increased bacterial resistance to 4-HNE in vitro and promoted bacterial survival following phagocytosis by murine macrophages in an ROS-dependent manner. Thus, Rha1 and Rha2 are not necessary for 4-HNE resistance in <i>L. monocytogenes</i> but are sufficient to confer resistance to an otherwise sensitive organism in vitro and in host cells. Our work demonstrates that 4-HNE is a previously unappreciated component of ROS-mediated toxicity encountered by bacteria within eukaryotic hosts.","['Aldehydes', 'Animals', 'Bacillus subtilis', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phagocytosis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene name (Bacillus subtilis)', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Concentration', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Vienna RNA concentration data', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Molecular docking', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice']"

Pol IV generates short RNAs required to guide de novo methylation in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway.

Application of XRBS to single leukemia cells enabled us to evaluate genetic copy number variations and methylation variability across individual cells.

Here, we create a h2a.w null mutant via CRISPR-Cas9, h2a.w-2, to analyze the in vivo function of H2A.W. We find that H2A.W antagonizes deposition of H1 at heterochromatin and that non-CG methylation and accessibility are moderately decreased in h2a.w-2 heterochromatin. Compared to H1 loss alone, combined loss of H1 and H2A.W greatly increases accessibility and facilitates non-CG DNA methylation in heterochromatin, suggesting co-regulation of heterochromatic features by H2A.W and H1. Our results suggest that H2A.W helps maintain optimal heterochromatin accessibility and DNA methylation by promoting chromatin compaction together with H1, while also inhibiting excessive H1 incorporation.","['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Plant', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genetic Variation', 'Heterochromatin', 'Histones', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleosomes', 'Plant Leaves', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Plant biology', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Sequence variations', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Histogram', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Exome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing']"

Nonetheless, effects of tesamorelin on individual plasma proteins pertaining to these pathways are not known. Leveraging our prior randomized-controlled trial and transcriptomic approach, we performed a focused assessment of 9 plasma proteins corresponding to top leading edge genes within differentially modulated gene sets. Tesamorelin led to significant reductions in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA, log<sub>2</sub>-fold change - 0.20 ± 0.35 vs. 0.05 ± 0.34, P = 0.02), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1, - 0.35 ± 0.56 vs. - 0.05 ± 0.43, P = 0.05), and macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1, - 0.17 ± 0.21 vs. 0.02 ± 0.20, P = 0.004) versus placebo. Among tesamorelin-treated participants, reductions in plasma VEGFA (r = 0.62, P = 0.006) and CSF1 (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) correlated with a decline in NAFLD activity score.

747,34043740,"Antiviral therapeutics are a front-line defense against virally induced diseases. Because viruses frequently mutate to escape direct inhibition of viral proteins, there is interest in targeting the host proteins that the virus must co-opt to complete its replication cycle. However, a detailed understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is necessary in order to facilitate development of host-directed therapeutics. As a first step, we performed a genome-wide loss of function screen using the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E to better define the interactions between coronaviruses and host factors. We report the identification and validation of an ER-resident host protein, TMEM41B, as an essential host factor for not only HCoV-229E but also genetically distinct coronaviruses including the pandemic betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We show that the protein is required at an early, but post-receptor engagement, stage of the viral lifecycle. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that although the protein was not enriched at replication complexes, it likely contributes to viral replication complex formation via mobilization of cholesterol and other lipids to facilitate host membrane expansion and curvature. Continued study of TMEM41B and the development of approaches to prevent its function may lead to broad spectrum anti-coronavirus therapeutics.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Coronavirus 229E, Human', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Host Microbial Interactions', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid map', 'Protein interactions', 'Microbial collection', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Virus annotation', 'Virus identifier']"

749,34061819,"Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic ""basins of attraction,"" across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms', 'Phenotype', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Transcriptome']","['Plant biology', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Simulation', 'Simulation analysis', 'Computer science', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Structure processing', 'Sequence processing', 'Data handling', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Although the tumor cell is the main actor in cancer progression, it is not the only element of the disease. Cells and the matrix surrounding the tumor, called the tumor microenvironment (TME), play key roles in cancer progression. Phenotypic changes of the TME are indispensable for disease progression and a few of these transformations are produced by epigenetic changes including miRNA dysregulation. In this study, we found that a specific group of miRNAs in the liver TME produced by colon cancer called geromiRs, which are miRNAs related to the ageing process, are significantly downregulated. The three principal cell types involved in the liver TME, namely, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate (Ito) cells and Kupffer cells, were isolated from a murine hepatic metastasis model, and the miRNA and gene expression profiles were studied. From the 115 geromiRs and their associated hallmarks of aging, which we compiled from the literature, 75 were represented in the used microarrays, 26 out of them were downregulated in the TME cells during colon cancer colonization of the liver, and none of them were upregulated.

Although plants have DNA methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H = A, T, C), methylation in the symmetric CG context is particularly important for gene silencing and is very efficiently maintained through mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. Tools that can directly add CG methylation to specific loci are therefore highly desirable but are currently lacking in plants. Here we have developed two CRISPR-based CG-specific targeted DNA methylation systems for plants using a variant of the bacterial CG-specific DNA methyltransferase MQ1 with reduced activity but high specificity. We demonstrate that the methylation added by MQ1 is highly target specific and can be heritably maintained in the absence of the effector.

In this study, we aimed to develop an integrative workflow to evaluate responses to PRP in vitro, and to assess if the in vitro responses to PRP are associated with the PRP composition and clinical outcomes in patients with knee OA. To do this, we used a coculture system of macrophages and fibroblasts paired with transcriptomic analyses to comprehensively characterize the modulation of inflammatory responses by PRP in vitro. Relying on patient-reported outcomes and achievement of minimal clinically important differences in OA patients receiving PRP injections, we identified responders and non-responders to the treatment. Comparisons of PRP from these patient groups allowed us to identify differences in the composition and in vitro activity of PRP.

Here, in silico docking identified a potent STING antagonist SN-011 that binds with higher affinity to the cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-binding pocket of STING than endogenous 2'3'-cGAMP.

However, modulating macrophages has proved extremely difficult, as we still lack a complete understanding of the molecular and functional diversity of the tumour macrophage compartment. Macrophages arise from two distinct lineages. Tissue-resident macrophages self-renew locally, independent of adult haematopoiesis<sup>3-5</sup>, whereas short-lived monocyte-derived macrophages arise from adult haematopoietic stem cells, and accumulate mostly in inflamed lesions<sup>1</sup>. How these macrophage lineages contribute to the TME and cancer progression remains unclear. To explore the diversity of the macrophage compartment in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) lesions, here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of tumour-associated leukocytes. We identified distinct populations of macrophages that were enriched in human and mouse lung tumours. Using lineage tracing, we discovered that these macrophage populations differ in origin and have a distinct temporal and spatial distribution in the TME. Tissue-resident macrophages accumulate close to tumour cells early during tumour formation to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness in tumour cells, and they also induce a potent regulatory T cell response that protects tumour cells from adaptive immunity. Depletion of tissue-resident macrophages reduced the numbers and altered the phenotype of regulatory T cells, promoted the accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduced tumour invasiveness and growth. During tumour growth, tissue-resident macrophages became redistributed at the periphery of the TME, which becomes dominated by monocyte-derived macrophages in both mouse and human NSCLC.

We circumvented this issue with a well-tested strategy that expressed Δ40p53:WTp53 as a single transcript, ensuring a 2:2 tetramer stoichiometry. Human MCF10A cell lines expressing Δ40p53:WTp53, WTp53, or WTp53:WTp53 (as controls) from the native TP53 locus were examined with transcriptomics (precision nuclear run-on sequencing [PRO-seq] and RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), metabolomics, and other methods. Δ40p53:WTp53 was transcriptionally active, and, although phenotypically similar to WTp53 under normal conditions, it failed to induce growth arrest upon Nutlin-induced p53 activation. This occurred via Δ40p53:WTp53-dependent inhibition of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and subsequent failure to induce mRNA biogenesis, despite similar genomic occupancy to WTp53. A different stimulus (5-fluorouracil [5FU]) also showed Δ40p53:WTp53-specific changes in mRNA induction; however, other transcription factors (TFs; e.g., E2F2) could then drive the response, yielding similar outcomes vs. WTp53. Our results establish that Δ40p53 tempers WTp53 function to enable compensatory responses by other stimulus-specific TFs. Such modulation of WTp53 activity may be an essential physiological function for Δ40p53.

Here we show that long-range activation using CRISPR-based aTFs in human cells can be made more efficient and reliable by concurrently targeting an aTF to the target gene promoter. We used this strategy to direct target gene choice for enhancers capable of regulating more than one promoter and to achieve allele-selective activation of human genes by targeting aTFs to single-nucleotide polymorphisms embedded in distally located sequences.

763,34363355,"Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) consist of heterogeneous subpopulations that play a critical role in the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. The extracellular signals of CAFs have been attributed to the extracellular matrix, cytokines, cell surface checkpoints, and exosomes. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the CD10 transmembrane hydrolase expressed on a subset of CAFs supports tumor stemness and induces chemoresistance. Mechanistically, CD10 degenerates an antitumoral peptide termed osteogenic growth peptide (OGP). OGP restrains the expression of rate-limiting desaturase SCD1 and inhibits lipid desaturation, which is required for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CD10 significantly improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Clinically, CD10-OGP signals are associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The collective data suggest that a nexus between the niche and lipid metabolism in CSCs is a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts', 'China', 'Female', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Neprilysin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase', 'Tumor Microenvironment']","['BEAST', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Cancer type', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Regenerative medicine', 'genePred', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Tumor annotation']"
764,34365695,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that plays an essential role under nutrient starvation conditions and influences different developmental processes. We observed that seedlings of autophagy mutants (atg2, atg5, atg7, and atg9) germinated in the dark showed delayed chloroplast development following illumination. The delayed chloroplast development was characterized by a decrease in photosynthetic and chlorophyll biosynthetic proteins, lower chlorophyll content, reduced chloroplast size, and increased levels of proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis. Confirming the biological impact of these differences, photosynthetic performance was impaired in autophagy mutants 12 h post-illumination. We observed that while gene expression for photosynthetic machinery during de-etiolation was largely unaffected in atg mutants, several genes involved in photosystem assembly were transcriptionally downregulated. We also investigated if the delayed chloroplast development could be explained by lower lipid import to the chloroplast or lower triglyceride (TAG) turnover. We observed that the limitations in the chloroplast lipid import imposed by trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1 are unlikely to explain the delay in chloroplast development. However, we found that lower TAG mobility in the triacylglycerol lipase mutant sugardependent1 significantly affected de-etiolation. Moreover, we showed that lower levels of carbon resources exacerbated the slow greening phenotype whereas higher levels of carbon resources had an opposite effect. This work suggests a lack of autophagy machinery limits chloroplast development during de-etiolation, and this is exacerbated by limited lipid turnover (lipophagy) that physically or energetically restrains chloroplast development.","['Aminopeptidases', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Carbon', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Chloroplasts', 'Darkness', 'Etiolation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Light', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Photosynthesis', 'Seedlings']","['Peptides and amino acids', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate identifier', 'Protein hydropathy cluster calculation', 'Isolation report', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Light microscopy', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'medline', 'PubMed XML', 'Medline UI']"

Via its receptor (PGR) expressed in differentiated LM cells, progesterone stimulates paracrine signaling that induces proliferation of PGR-deficient LM stem cells (LSCs). Antiprogestins shrink LM but tumors regrow after treatment cessation possibly due to persisting LSCs. Using sorted primary LM cell populations, we found that the PGR gene locus and its target cistrome are hypermethylated in LSCs, inhibiting the expression of genes critical for progesterone-induced LSC differentiation. PGR knockdown shifted the transcriptome of total LM cells toward LSCs and increased global DNA methylation by regulating TET methylcytosine dioxygenases. DNA methylation inhibitor 5'-Aza activated PGR signaling, stimulated LSC differentiation, and synergized with antiprogestin to reduce tumor size in vivo.

768,34407985,"Nucleosomes composed of histones are the fundamental units around which DNA is wrapped to form chromatin. Transcriptionally active euchromatin or repressive heterochromatin is regulated in part by the addition or removal of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) by ""writer"" and ""eraser"" enzymes, respectively. Nucleosomal PTMs are recognized by a variety of ""reader"" proteins that alter gene expression accordingly. The histone tails of the evolutionarily divergent eukaryotic parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> have atypical sequences and PTMs distinct from those often considered universally conserved. Here we identify 65 predicted readers, writers, and erasers of histone acetylation and methylation encoded in the <i>T. brucei</i> genome and, by epitope tagging, systemically localize 60 of them in the parasite's bloodstream form. ChIP-seq shows that 15 candidate proteins associate with regions of RNAPII transcription initiation. Eight other proteins show a distinct distribution with specific peaks at a subset of RNAPII transcription termination regions marked by RNAPIII-transcribed tRNA and snRNA genes. Proteomic analyses identify distinct protein interaction networks comprising known chromatin regulators and novel trypanosome-specific components. Notably, several SET- and Bromo-domain protein networks suggest parallels to RNAPII promoter-associated complexes in conventional eukaryotes. Further, we identify likely components of TbSWR1 and TbNuA4 complexes whose enrichment coincides with the SWR1-C exchange substrate H2A.Z at RNAPII transcription start regions. The systematic approach used provides details of the composition and organization of the chromatin regulatory machinery in <i>T. brucei</i> and establishes a route to explore divergence from eukaryotic norms in an evolutionarily ancient but experimentally accessible eukaryote.","['Chromatin', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteomics', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Trypanosoma brucei)']"
769,34417450,"Histone lysine methylations have primarily been linked to selective recruitment of reader or effector proteins that subsequently modify chromatin regions and mediate genome functions. Here, we describe a divergent role for histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) and demonstrate that it directly facilitates chromatin openness and accessibility by disrupting chromatin folding. Thus, accumulation of H4K20me1 demarcates highly accessible chromatin at genes, and this is maintained throughout the cell cycle. In vitro, H4K20me1-containing nucleosomal arrays with nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL) of 187 and 197 are less compact than unmethylated (H4K20me0) or trimethylated (H4K20me3) arrays. Concordantly, and in contrast to trimethylated and unmethylated tails, solid-state NMR data shows that H4K20 mono-methylation changes the H4 conformational state and leads to more dynamic histone H4-tails. Notably, the increased chromatin accessibility mediated by H4K20me1 facilitates gene expression, particularly of housekeeping genes. Altogether, we show how the methylation state of a single histone H4 residue operates as a focal point in chromatin structure control. While H4K20me1 directly promotes chromatin openness at highly transcribed genes, it also serves as a stepping-stone for H4K20me3-dependent chromatin compaction.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Genes, Essential', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Conformation', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Essential dynamics', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Analysis', 'NMR', 'NMR data format', 'MRI', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein interaction format', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data<sup>3</sup> enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments<sup>4</sup>. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.","['Animals', 'Atlases as Topic', 'Brain', 'Chromatin', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Dentate Gyrus', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenome', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hippocampus', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Single-Cell Analysis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Topic', 'Tool topic', 'Study topic', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Cytometry', 'Cytoband position', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Data', 'Date', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome map', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Pathway or network', 'Pathway ID (WikiPathways)', 'Signaling pathways', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis']"
780,34619179,"Arsenic (As) contamination in groundwater is responsible for numerous adverse health outcomes among millions of people. Epigenetic alterations are among the most widely studied mechanisms of As toxicity. To understand how As exposure alters gene expression through epigenetic modifications, a systematic genome-wide study was designed to address the impact of multiple important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to As exposure on the methylome of drinking water As-exposed rural subjects from Pakistan. Urinary As levels were used to stratify subjects into low, medium and high exposure groups. Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using MeDIP in combination with NimbleGen 2.1 M Deluxe Promotor arrays. Transcriptome levels were measured using Agilent 8 × 60 K expression arrays. Genotyping of selected SNPs (As3MT, DNMT1a, ERCC2, EGFR and MTHFR) was measured and an integrated genetic risk factor for each respondent was calculated by assigning a specific value to the measured genotypes based on known risk allele numbers. To select a representative model related to As exposure we compared 9 linear mixed models comprising of model 1 (including the genetic risk factor), model 2 (without the genetic risk factor) and models with individual SNPs incorporated into the methylome data. Pathway analysis was performed using ConsensusPathDB. Model 1 comprising the integrated genetic risk factor disclosed biochemical pathways including muscle contraction, cardio-vascular diseases, ATR signaling, GPCR signaling, methionine metabolism and chromatin modification in association with hypo- and hyper-methylated gene targets. A unique pathway (direct P53 effector) was found associated with the individual DNMT1a polymorphism due to hyper-methylation of CSE1L and TRRAP. Most importantly, we provide here the first evidence of As-associated DNA methylation in relation with gene expression of ATR, ATF7IP, TPM3, UBE2J2. We report the first evidence that integrating SNPs data with methylome data generates a more representative epigenome profile and discloses a better insight in disease risks of As-exposed individuals.","['Arsenic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group D Protein']","['Cytogenetic map', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Keyword', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Enzymes', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'protein', 'Protein alignment', 'Protein data']"

However, since quantitation of the partial pressure of cellular oxygen in vivo is challenging, the extent of oxygen perturbation in situ and its cellular response remains underexplored. Using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we determine the physiological range of oxygen tension in osteoclasts of live mice. We find that oxygen tension ranges from 17.4 to 36.4 mmHg, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. Physiological normoxia thus corresponds to 5% and hypoxia to 2% oxygen in osteoclasts. Hypoxia in this range severely limits osteoclastogenesis, independent of energy metabolism and hypoxia-inducible factor activity. We observe that hypoxia decreases ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity. Tet2/3 cooperatively induces Prdm1 expression via oxygen-dependent DNA demethylation, which in turn activates NFATc1 required for osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our results reveal that TET enzymes, acting as functional oxygen sensors, regulate osteoclastogenesis within the physiological range of oxygen tension, thus opening new avenues for research on in vivo response to oxygen perturbation.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'DNA Demethylation', 'Hypoxia', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts', 'Oxygen']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'GEN']"
783,34711612,"Continuous risk of recurrence scores (CRS) based on tumor gene expression are vital prognostic tools for breast cancer. Studies have shown that Black women (BW) have higher CRS than White women (WW). Although systemic injustices contribute substantially to breast cancer disparities, evidence of biological and germline contributions is emerging. In this study, we investigated germline genetic associations with CRS and CRS disparity using approaches modeled after transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, using race-specific predictive models of tumor expression from germline genetics, we performed race-stratified (<i>N</i> = 1,043 WW, 1,083 BW) linear regressions of three CRS (ROR-S: PAM50 subtype score; proliferation score; ROR-P: ROR-S plus proliferation score) on imputed tumor genetically regulated tumor expression (GReX). Bayesian multivariate regression and adaptive shrinkage tested GReX-prioritized genes for associations with tumor PAM50 expression and subtype to elucidate patterns of germline regulation underlying GReX-CRS associations. At FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.10, 7 and 1 GReX prioritized genes among WW and BW, respectively. Among WW, CRS were positively associated with <i>MCM10</i>, <i>FAM64A</i>, <i>CCNB2</i>, and <i>MMP1</i> GReX and negatively associated with <i>VAV3</i>, <i>PCSK6</i>, and <i>GNG11</i> GReX. Among BW, higher <i>MMP1</i> GReX predicted lower proliferation score and ROR-P. GReX-prioritized gene and PAM50 tumor expression associations highlighted potential mechanisms for GReX-prioritized gene to CRS associations. Among patients with breast cancer, differential germline associations with CRS were found by race, underscoring the need for larger, diverse datasets in molecular studies of breast cancer. These findings also suggest possible germline <i>trans</i>-regulation of PAM50 tumor expression, with potential implications for CRS interpretation in clinical settings.

The mechanism of its pathogenesis, especially the functions and host targets of its effector proteins, are unknown. In order to identify putative effectors involving in S. scitamineum infection, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted based on the transcriptome profiles of both smut fungus and sugarcane using a customized microarray. A smut effector gene, termed SsPele1, showed strong co-expression with sugarcane PLANT ELICITOR PEPTIDE RECEPTOR1 (ScPEPR1), which encodes a receptor like kinase for perception of plant elicitor peptide1 (ScPep1). The relationship between SsPele1 and ScPEPR1, and the biological function of SsPele1 were characterized in this study. The SsPele1 C-terminus contains a plant elicitor peptide-like motif, by which SsPele1 interacts strongly with ScPEPR1. Strikingly, the perception of ScPep1 on ScPEPR1 is competed by SsPele1 association, leading to the suppression of ScPEPR1-mediated immune responses. Moreover, the Ustilago maydis effector UmPele1, an ortholog of SsPele1, promotes fungal virulence using the same strategy. This study reveals a novel strategy by which a fungal effector can mimic the plant elicitor peptide to complete its perception and attenuate receptor-activated immunity.","['Peptides', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Immunity', 'Saccharum', 'Ustilaginales']","['Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Plant biology', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Monosaccharide identifier']"

To explore mechanisms by which these organs communicate, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq analysis on fibroblasts from humans and mice with IBD. This analysis revealed that intestinal inflammation promoted differentiation of a subset of intestinal stromal fibroblasts into preadipocytes with innate antimicrobial host defense activity. Furthermore, this process of reactive adipogenesis was exacerbated if mouse skin was inflamed as a result of skin wounding or infection. Since hyaluronan (HA) catabolism is activated during skin injury and fibroblast-to-adipocyte differentiation is dependent on HA, we tested the hypothesis that HA fragments could alter colon fibroblast function by targeted expression of human hyaluronidase-1 in basal keratinocytes from mouse skin. Hyaluronidase expression in the skin activated intestinal stromal fibroblasts, altered the fecal microbiome, and promoted excessive reactive adipogenesis and increased inflammation in the colon after challenge with dextran sodium sulfate. The response to digested HA was dependent on expression of TLR4 by preadipocytes. Collectively, these results suggest that the association between skin inflammation and IBD may be due to recognition by mesenchymal fibroblasts in the colon of HA released during inflammation of the skin.","['Animals', 'Colitis', 'Fibroblasts', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Keratinocytes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Skin']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence masking']"

How countless partially overlapping but cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression are controlled at the genomic level remains poorly understood. Here we show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex gene regulatory systems composed of independent cell-type- and cell-stage-specific regulatory elements that reside in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Mapping enhancer-promoter interactions revealed that motor neuron enhancers are broadly distributed across the large chromatin domains. This distributed regulatory architecture is not a unique property of motor neurons but is employed throughout the nervous system. The number of regulatory elements increased dramatically during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, suggesting that acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity.","['Animals', 'Chromatin', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Motor Neurons', 'Vertebrates']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Vertebrates', 'Invertebrates']"

Circadian rhythms are disturbed in Hnf4a knockout liver and HNF4A-MODY diabetic model cells. Additionally, the epigenetic state and accessibility of the liver genome dynamically change throughout the day, synchronized with chromatin occupancy of HNF4A and clustered expression of circadian outputs.

790,34784301,"BACKGROUNDSkeletal muscle maladaptation accompanies chronic kidney disease (CKD) and negatively affects physical function. Emphasis in CKD has historically been placed on muscle fiber-intrinsic deficits, such as altered protein metabolism and atrophy. However, targeted treatment of fiber-intrinsic dysfunction has produced limited improvement, whereas alterations within the fiber-extrinsic environment have scarcely been examined.METHODSWe investigated alterations to the skeletal muscle interstitial environment with deep cellular phenotyping of biopsies from patients with CKD and age-matched controls and performed transcriptome profiling to define the molecular underpinnings of CKD-associated muscle impairments. We examined changes in muscle maladaptation following initiation of dialysis therapy for kidney failure.RESULTSPatients with CKD exhibited a progressive fibrotic muscle phenotype, which was associated with impaired regenerative capacity and lower vascular density. The severity of these deficits was strongly associated with the degree of kidney dysfunction. Consistent with these profound deficits, CKD was associated with broad alterations to the muscle transcriptome, including altered ECM organization, downregulated angiogenesis, and altered expression of pathways related to stem cell self-renewal. Remarkably, despite the seemingly advanced nature of this fibrotic transformation, dialysis treatment rescued these deficits, restoring a healthier muscle phenotype. Furthermore, after accounting for muscle atrophy, strength and endurance improved after dialysis initiation.CONCLUSIONThese data identify a dialysis-responsive muscle fibrotic phenotype in CKD and suggest the early dialysis window presents a unique opportunity of improved muscle regenerative capacity during which targeted interventions may achieve maximal impact.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT01452412FUNDINGNIH, NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center.","['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscular Diseases', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic', 'Risk Factors']","['Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'Prosite accession number', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Analysis', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Although recent studies have revealed a uniquely relaxed genome conformation in totipotent early blastomeres of both fertilized and cloned embryos, how weakened higher-order chromatin structure is functionally linked to totipotency acquisition remains elusive. Using low-input Hi-C, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, we systematically examined the dynamics of 3D genome and epigenome during pluripotent to totipotent-like state transition in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The spontaneously converted 2-cell-embryo-like cells (2CLCs) exhibited more relaxed chromatin architecture compared to ESCs, including global weakening of both enhancer-promoter interactions and TAD insulation. While the former correlated with inactivation of ESC enhancers and down-regulation of pluripotent genes, the latter might facilitate contacts between the putative new enhancers arising in 2CLCs and neighboring 2C genes. Importantly, disruption of chromatin organization by depleting CTCF or the cohesin complex promoted the ESC to 2CLC transition. Our results thus establish a critical role of 3D genome organization in totipotency acquisition.","['Animals', 'Chromatin', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein interaction format', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mouse clinic', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology']"

While BM-MSCs have high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, the cell subtypes that contribute to this heterogeneity <i>in vivo</i> in humans have not been characterized.

Loss of Daxx alters the chromatin landscape, H3.3 distribution and histone marks of haematopoietic progenitors, leading to engagement of a Pu.1-dependent transcriptional programme for myelopoiesis at the expense of B-cell differentiation. This causes neutrophilia and inflammation, predisposing mice to develop an autoinflammatory skin disease.

The expression of Letmd1 is induced in brown fat by cold exposure and by β-adrenergic activation. Letmd1-deficient mice exhibit severe cold intolerance concomitant with abnormal brown fat morphology, reduced thermogenic gene expression, and low mitochondrial content. The null mice exhibit impaired β3-adrenoreceptor-dependent thermogenesis and are prone to diet-induced obesity and defective glucose disposal.

Conversely, androgen deprivation in vitro and in vivo increases MYC expression. In parallel, global AR activity is suppressed by MYC overexpression, consistent with coactivator redistribution. These suppressive effects of AR and MYC are mitigated at shared AR/MYC binding sites, which also have markedly higher levels of H3K27 acetylation, indicating enrichment for functional enhancers.

Spermidine, a selective activator of TC45, rescues exacerbated phenotype of HSPCs in IFN-γ-treated Hemgn<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these results identify that Hemgn is a critical regulator for successful engraftment and reconstitution of HSPCs in mice through negatively regulating IFN-γ signaling. Targeted Hemgn may be used to improve conditioning regimens and engraftment during HSPCs transplantation.","['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Mice', 'Transplantation Conditioning']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Cell line report', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transition matrix']"
797,34969962,"Loss of alveolar type 2 cells (AEC2s) and the ectopic appearance of basal cells in the alveoli characterize severe lung injuries such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we demonstrate that human alveolar type 2 cells (hAEC2s), unlike murine AEC2s, transdifferentiate into basal cells in response to fibrotic signalling in the lung mesenchyme, in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell analysis of normal hAEC2s and mesenchymal cells in organoid co-cultures revealed the emergence of pathologic fibroblasts and basaloid cells previously described in IPF. Transforming growth factor-β1 and anti-bone morphogenic protein signalling in the organoids promoted transdifferentiation. Trajectory and histologic analyses of both hAEC2-derived organoids and IPF epithelium indicated that hAEC2s transdifferentiate into basal cells through alveolar-basal intermediates that accumulate in proximity to pathologic CTHRC1<sup>hi</sup>/TGFB1<sup>hi</sup> fibroblasts. Our study indicates that hAEC2 loss and expansion of alveolar metaplastic basal cells in severe human lung injuries are causally connected through an hAEC2-basal cell lineage trajectory driven by aberrant mesenchyme.","['Alveolar Epithelial Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Keratin-5', 'Mesoderm', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pulmonary Alveoli', 'Respiratory Mucosa', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Annotation track', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

799,35082446,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Helicases', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mesoderm', 'Mice', 'Myocardium', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Neurogenesis', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-6', 'Phenotype', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Stem Cells', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Protein data', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Helical net', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'MAT', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Protein report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Retention time prediction', 'Transcription']"
800,35084335,"There is mounting evidence that microbes residing in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite TMA is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.","['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hepatitis', 'Methylamines', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Random Allocation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Compound name', 'Cheminformatics', 'Chemical identifier', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Random sequence generation', 'Sequence mutation and randomisation', 'EMBL feature location']"

Here, we combined cell-type-resolved genomics and computational approaches to map crosstalk between hepatocytes and liver macrophages during fasting. We identified the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a key driver of fasting-induced reprogramming of the macrophage secretome including fasting-suppressed cytokines and showed that lack of macrophage GR impaired induction of ketogenesis during fasting as well as endotoxemia. Mechanistically, macrophage GR suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and promoted nuclear translocation of hepatocyte GR to activate a fat oxidation/ketogenesis-related gene program, cooperatively induced by GR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in hepatocytes. Together, our results demonstrate how resident liver macrophages directly influence ketogenesis in hepatocytes, thereby also outlining a strategy by which the immune system can set the metabolic tone during inflammatory disease and infection.","['Animals', 'Fasting', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Ketone Bodies', 'Liver', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PPAR alpha', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'FASTA', 'FASTQ', 'FASTG', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular docking', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Alpha diversity data', 'C-alpha trace', 'Structure alignment (protein C-alpha atoms)', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

Here, we screen a compound library for synergy with low-dose BCL-XL inhibitor A-1155463 to identify pathways that regulate sensitivity to BCL-XL inhibition and reveal that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)4 inhibition effectively sensitizes to A-1155463 both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we identify a rescue response that is activated upon BCL-XL inhibition and leads to rapid FGF2 secretion and subsequent FGFR4-mediated post-translational stabilization of MCL-1. FGFR4 inhibition prevents MCL-1 upregulation and thereby sensitizes CSCs to BCL-XL inhibition.

Calorie restriction (CR) potently extends health and lifespan, but is largely unachievable in humans, making ""CR mimetics"" of great interest. CR targets nutrient-sensing pathways centering on mTORC1. The mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, is considered a potential CR mimetic and is proven to counteract age-related muscle loss. Therefore, we tested whether rapamycin acts via similar mechanisms as CR to slow muscle aging. Here we show that long-term CR and rapamycin unexpectedly display distinct gene expression profiles in geriatric mouse skeletal muscle, despite both benefiting aging muscles. Furthermore, CR improves muscle integrity in mice with nutrient-insensitive, sustained muscle mTORC1 activity and rapamycin provides additive benefits to CR in naturally aging mouse muscles. We conclude that rapamycin and CR exert distinct, compounding effects in aging skeletal muscle, thus opening the possibility of parallel interventions to counteract muscle aging.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Sirolimus']","['Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Restriction map', 'Restriction sites', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Virology']"

Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of Crenigacestat, a selective inhibitor of NOTCH1 signaling, against the cross-talk between cancer cells and the surrounding ecosystem in an in vivo HuCCT1-xenograft model. In the present study, a transcriptomic analysis approach, validated by Western blotting and qRT-PCR on iCCA tumor masses treated with Crenigacestat, was used to study the molecular pathways responsive to drug treatment. Our results indicate that Crenigacestat significantly inhibited NOTCH1 and HES1, whereas tumor progression was not affected. In addition, the drug triggered a strong immune response and blocked neovascularization in the tumor ecosystem of the HuCCT1-xenograft model without affecting the occurrence of fibrotic reactions.

In contrast to previous findings, our data suggest that Titan mice are metabolically unhealthy obese and short-lived. Line-specific patterns of genetic invariability are in accordance with observed phenotypic traits. Titan mice also show modifications in the liver transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome linked to metabolic (dys)regulations.

In the liver, YAP activity is linked to hepatomegaly, regeneration, dedifferentiation, and aggressive tumor growth. Here we present genomic studies to address how YAP may elicit such profound biological changes in murine models. YAP bound the genome in a TEAD-dependent manner, either at loci constitutively occupied by TEAD or by pioneering enhancers, which comprised a fraction of HNF4a/FOXA-bound embryonic enhancers active during embryonic development but silent in the adult. YAP triggered transcription on promoters by recruiting BRD4, enhancing H3K122 acetylation, and promoting RNApol2 loading and pause-release. YAP also repressed HNF4a target genes by binding to their promoters and enhancers, thus preventing RNApol2 pause-release. YAP activation led to the induction of hepatocyte proliferation, accompanied by tissue remodeling, characterized by polarized macrophages, exhausted T-lymphocytes and dedifferentiation of endothelial cells into proliferative progenitors. Overall, these analyses suggest that YAP is a master regulator of liver function that reshapes the enhancer landscape to control transcription of genes involved in metabolism, proliferation, and inflammation, subverts lineage specification programs by antagonizing HNF4a and modulating the immune infiltrate and the vascular architecture of the liver.","['Animals', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4', 'Liver', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein signature']"

Using ribosome footprinting, we analyze translational changes that occur upon CHIKV infection. We show that CHIKV infection induces codon-specific reprogramming of the host translation machinery to favor the translation of viral RNA genomes over host mRNAs with an otherwise optimal codon usage. This reprogramming was mostly apparent at the endoplasmic reticulum, where CHIKV RNAs show high ribosome occupancy. Mechanistically, it involves CHIKV-induced overexpression of KIAA1456, an enzyme that modifies the wobble U34 position in the anticodon of tRNAs, which is required for proper decoding of codons that are highly enriched in CHIKV RNAs.

It arises at gene regulatory elements by epigenetic demethylation during transcriptional activation<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we show that promoters are protected from oxidative damage via a process mediated by the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA (also known as NUMA1). NuMA exhibits genomic occupancy approximately 100 bp around transcription start sites. It binds the initiating form of RNA polymerase II, pause-release factors and single-strand break repair (SSBR) components such as TDP1. The binding is increased on chromatin following oxidative damage, and TDP1 enrichment at damaged chromatin is facilitated by NuMA. Depletion of NuMA increases oxidative damage at promoters. NuMA promotes transcription by limiting the polyADP-ribosylation of RNA polymerase II, increasing its availability and release from pausing at promoters. Metabolic labelling of nascent RNA identifies genes that depend on NuMA for transcription including immediate-early response genes. Complementation of NuMA-deficient cells with a mutant that mediates binding to SSBR, or a mitotic separation-of-function mutant, restores SSBR defects.
