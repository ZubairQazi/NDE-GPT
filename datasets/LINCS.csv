Columbia LINCS Trans-Center project data,"The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is a multi-institutional, collaborative project initiated by the National Institutes of Health whose goal is to identify and categorize molecular signatures that occur when cells are exposed to agents that perturb their normal function. Understanding how perturbations affect the behavior of cells is important because it can provide insights into the causes of disease and help researchers develop new therapeutic strategies."
"LINCS Canvas Browser: interactive web app to query, browse and interrogate LINCS L1000 gene expression signatures.","For the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project many gene expression signatures using the L1000 technology have been produced. The L1000 technology is a cost-effective method to profile gene expression in large scale. LINCS Canvas Browser (LCB) is an interactive HTML5 web-based software application that facilitates querying, browsing and interrogating many of the currently available LINCS L1000 data. LCB implements two compacted layered canvases, one to visualize clustered L1000 expression data, and the other to display enrichment analysis results using 30 different gene set libraries. Clicking on an experimental condition highlights gene-sets enriched for the differentially expressed genes from the selected experiment. A search interface allows users to input gene lists and query them against over 100 000 conditions to find the top matching experiments. The tool integrates many resources for an unprecedented potential for new discoveries in systems biology and systems pharmacology. The LCB application is available at http://www.maayanlab.net/LINCS/LCB. Customized versions will be made part of the http://lincscloud.org and http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu websites."

Systematic Quality Control Analysis of LINCS Data.,"The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project provides comprehensive transcriptome profiling of human cell lines before and after chemical and genetic perturbations. Its L1000 platform utilizes 978 landmark genes to infer the transcript levels of 14,292 genes computationally. Here we conducted the L1000 data quality control analysis by using MCF7, PC3, and A375 cell lines as representative examples. Before perturbations, a promising 80% correlation in transcriptome was observed between L1000- and Affymetrix HU133A-platforms. After library-based shRNA perturbations, a moderate 30% of differentially expressed genes overlapped between any two selected controls viral vectors using the L1000 platform. The mitogen-activated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and T-cell receptor pathways were identified as the most significantly shared pathways between chemical and genetic perturbations in cancer cells. In conclusion, L1000 platform is reliable in assessing transcriptome before perturbation. Its response to perturbagens needs to be interpreted with caution. A quality control analysis pipeline of L1000 is recommended before addressing biological questions."
Compound signature detection on LINCS L1000 big data.,"The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 big data provide gene expression profiles induced by over 10?000 compounds, shRNAs, and kinase inhibitors using the L1000 platform. We developed csNMF, a systematic compound signature discovery pipeline covering from raw L1000 data processing to drug screening and mechanism generation. The csNMF pipeline demonstrated better performance than the original L1000 pipeline. The discovered compound signatures of breast cancer were consistent with the LINCS KINOMEscan data and were clinically relevant. The csNMF pipeline provided a novel and complete tool to expedite signature-based drug discovery leveraging the LINCS L1000 resources."

Drug-induced adverse events prediction with the LINCS L1000 data.,"MOTIVATION:Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a central consideration during drug development. Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features. The GE data is from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset that measured changes in GE before and after treatment of human cells with over 20 000 small-molecule compounds including most of the FDA-approved drugs. Using various benchmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover, transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action. Finally, we applied the classifier to all ?>20 000 small-molecules profiled, and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive small-molecule/ADR connections. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:The interface for the adverse event predictions for the ?>20 000 LINCS compounds is available at http://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/ CONTACT: avi.maayan@mssm.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Harnessing the biological complexity of Big Data from LINCS gene expression signatures.,"Gene expression profiling using transcriptional drug perturbations are useful for many biomedical discovery studies including drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms (MoA) and many other pharmacogenomic applications. However, limited data availability across cell types has severely hindered our capacity to progress in these areas. To fill this gap, recently, the LINCS program generated almost 1.3 million profiles for over 40,000 drug and genetic perturbations for over 70 different human cell types, including meta information about the experimental conditions and cell lines. Unfortunately, Big Data like the ones generated from the ongoing LINCS program do not enable easy insights from the data but possess considerable challenges toward their analysis. In this paper, we address some of these challenges. Specifically, first, we study the gene expression signature profiles from all cell lines and their perturbagents in order to obtain insights in the distributional characteristics of available conditions. Second, we investigate the differential expression of genes for all cell lines obtaining an understanding of condition dependent differential expression manifesting the biological complexity of perturbagents. As a result, our analysis helps the experimental design of follow-up studies, e.g., by selecting appropriate cell lines."
"Perturbational proteomic and transcriptional profiles of drug perturbations from Broad Institute LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics and Broad Institute LINCS Center for Transcriptomics (U54HG008097) (n=5,063)","The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH program which funds the generation of perturbational profiles across multiple cell and perturbation types, as well as read-outs, at a massive scale. The LINCS PCCSE uses two high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) assays to study the proteomic changes induced by drug and genetic perturbations. P100 monitors ~100 phosphorylated peptides from cellular proteins that serve as a reduced representation of the phosphoproteome. GCP monitors ~60 modified peptides from histones (e.g., methylated, acetylated, and combinations thereof) encompassing nearly every well-studied post-translational modification on the core nucleosomal histone proteins. Closely complementing these assays is the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay. The files available here contain P100, GCP, and L1000 data for 90 small-molecule perturbations in six cell lines (five cancer cell lines and a neurodevelopmental cell model). These data were generated under the auspices of the NIH LINCS Program (www.lincsproject.org). Note: Related GEO projects include a large corpus of additional L1000 data, available at GSE92742.The Platform for the L1000 data is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilonhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL20573For questions or assistance with this dataset, please email the Connectivity Map support team at: clue@broadinstitute.org
These data represent three different read-outs (phosphosignaling, chromatin modifications, and transcriptional changes) of the same 90 small-molecule perturbations in six cell lines. The duration of treatment was 3 hours for P100, 24 hours for GCP, and 6 hours for L1000. These data are available at multiple levels of processing: level 1 is fluorescence intensity (for L1000) or mass spectrometry extracted ion chromatogram traces (for P100, GCP); level 2 is gene expression or proteomic values without normalization; level 3 is normalized; and level 4 is differential (i.e., each sample is compared to all other samples on a plate)."
LINCS L1000 dataset-based repositioning of CGP-60474 as a highly potent anti-endotoxemic agent.,"Sepsis is one of the most common clinical syndromes that causes death and disability. Although many studies have developed drugs for sepsis treatment, none have decreased the mortality rate. The aim of this study was to identify a novel treatment option for sepsis using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000 perturbation dataset based on an in vitro and in vivo sepsis model. Sepsis-related microarray studies of early-stage inflammatory processes in patients and innate immune cells were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository and used for candidate drug selection based on the LINCS L1000 perturbation dataset. The anti-inflammatory effects of the selected candidate drugs were analyzed using activated macrophage cell lines. CGP-60474, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, was the most potent drug. It alleviated tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in activated macrophages by downregulating the NF-?B activity, and it reduced the mortality rate in LPS induced endotoxemia mice. This study shows that CGP-60474 could be a potential therapeutic candidate to attenuate the endotoxemic process. Additionally, the virtual screening strategy using the LINCS L1000 perturbation dataset could be a cost and time effective tool in the early stages of drug development."
l1kdeconv: an R package for peak calling analysis with LINCS L1000 data.,"BACKGROUND:LINCS L1000 is a high-throughput technology that allows gene expression measurement in a large number of assays. However, to fit the measurements of ~1000 genes in the ~500 color channels of LINCS L1000, every two landmark genes are designed to share a single channel. Thus, a deconvolution step is required to infer the expression values of each gene. Any errors in this step can be propagated adversely to the downstream analyses. RESULTS:We presented a LINCS L1000 data peak calling R package l1kdeconv based on a new outlier detection method and an aggregate Gaussian mixture model (AGMM). Upon the remove of outliers and the borrowing information among similar samples, l1kdeconv showed more stable and better performance than methods commonly used in LINCS L1000 data deconvolution. CONCLUSIONS:Based on the benchmark using both simulated data and real data, the l1kdeconv package achieved more stable results than the commonly used LINCS L1000 data deconvolution methods."

"Ontological representation, integration, and analysis of LINCS cell line cells and their cellular responses.","BACKGROUND:Aiming to understand cellular responses to different perturbations, the NIH Common Fund Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program involves many institutes and laboratories working on over a thousand cell lines. The community-based Cell Line Ontology (CLO) is selected as the default ontology for LINCS cell line representation and integration. RESULTS:CLO has consistently represented all 1097 LINCS cell lines and included information extracted from the LINCS Data Portal and ChEMBL. Using MCF 10A cell line cells as an example, we demonstrated how to ontologically model LINCS cellular signatures such as their non-tumorigenic epithelial cell type, three-dimensional growth, latrunculin-A-induced actin depolymerization and apoptosis, and cell line transfection. A CLO subset view of LINCS cell lines, named LINCS-CLOview, was generated to support systematic LINCS cell line analysis and queries. In summary, LINCS cell lines are currently associated with 43 cell types, 131 tissues and organs, and 121 cancer types. The LINCS-CLO view information can be queried using SPARQL scripts. CONCLUSIONS:CLO was used to support ontological representation, integration, and analysis of over a thousand LINCS cell line cells and their cellular responses."

P100 aggregated data - Chemical perturbations,"The P100 assay is a mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics assay that detects and quantifies a representative set of ~100 phosphopeptide probes that are present in a wide range of cell types and have been demonstrated to be modulated via perturbations.  Briefly, phosphopeptides are enriched via an automated protocol from proteins derived from cell pellets that have been perturbed by various reagents.  These peptides are mixed with a set of isotopically labeled internal standards that correspond to the analytes in the P100 assay.  This mixture is introduced into a mass spectrometer using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (LCMS) and subjected to an analysis method specific for quantification of the P100 analytes.  The behavior of more than 1000 unique phosphosites may be imputed from the profiles of the P100 analytes.  The resulting profiles are suitable for molecular signature generation, querying of signatures across cell perturbations and types, and modeling of response networks in cellular systems."

Domain-Specific Language domain analysis and evaluation: a systematic literature review,"In order to successfully implement Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), it is needed to systematically define and to support its development process; namely its Evaluation and the Domain Analysis phase. For that purpose, the studies were systematically selected from the most relevant venues that focus on the implementation of DSLs, in order to get insight if and how these development phases were performed. The special focus was given to the human-machine DSLs (excluding the machine-machine languages), the involvement of its end-users in the development process and the evaluation of DSLs usability, i.e. quality in use of DSLs. 
Preliminary results give us a notion that there is increased the state of practice of performing the evaluation of the DSLs, mostly including usability concerns, at least after its implementation. Generally, the quality of the reviewed studies was high. On another hand, rarely the assessments are done during domain analysis, which in general is not reporting inclusion of end-users or consideration of different use-cases, although the majority of studies refer to target non-programmers and to contribute easy in use. 
We did collect the valuable body of primary studies that are giving us answers to our research questions, however, to raise the credibility of the conclusions we should extend the analysis to other venues. Also, as we get insights into the categorization of practices we could specify more concretely answers that would give us means to perform more detailed meta-analysis. "

Deep Learning Benchmarks on L1000 Gene Expression Data.,"Gene expression data can offer deep, physiological insights beyond the static coding of the genome alone. We believe that realizing this potential requires specialized, high-capacity machine learning methods capable of using underlying biological structure, but the development of such models is hampered by the lack of published benchmark tasks and well characterized baselines. In this work, we establish such benchmarks and baselines by profiling many classifiers against biologically motivated tasks on two curated views of a large, public gene expression dataset (the LINCS corpus) and one privately produced dataset. We provide these two curated views of the public LINCS dataset and our benchmark tasks to enable direct comparisons to future methodological work and help spur deep learning method development on this modality. In addition to profiling a battery of traditional classifiers, including linear models, random forests, decision trees, K nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers, and feed-forward artificial neural networks (FF-ANNs), we also test a method novel to this data modality: graph convolugtional neural networks (GCNNs), which allow us to incorporate prior biological domain knowledge. We find that GCNNs can be highly performant, with large datasets, whereas FF-ANNs consistently perform well. Non-neural classifiers are dominated by linear models and KNN classifiers."

Viability and apoptosis measured by imaging in BRAF(V600E/D) melanoma cell lines following treatment with combinations of two compounds (viability/apoptosis dataset 1 of 2),"The dose response of human melanoma cell lines in response to Vemurafenib in combination with a second compound was measured at 72 hr to determine their effects on apoptosis and viability. Cells were treated in 3 replicates using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) D300 Digital Dispenser with 4 doses of Vemurafenib (1:3.16 dilution ratios) and 1 or 3 doses of a second compound for 72 hr. To score viability and apoptosis, a dye-based imaging assay was used. The cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33342 was used to mark all nuclei, and DEVD-NucView488 Caspase-3 substrate was used to mark the nuclei of cells undergoing apoptosis (i.e., in which caspase 3 is active)."

P100 aggregated data - CRISPR perturbations,"The P100 assay is a mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics assay that detects and quantifies a representative set of ~100 phosphopeptide probes that are present in a wide range of cell types and have been demonstrated to be modulated via perturbations.  Briefly, phosphopeptides are enriched via an automated protocol from proteins derived from cell pellets that have been perturbed by various reagents.  These peptides are mixed with a set of isotopically labeled internal standards that correspond to the analytes in the P100 assay.  This mixture is introduced into a mass spectrometer using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (LCMS) and subjected to an analysis method specific for quantification of the P100 analytes.  The behavior of more than 1000 unique phosphosites may be imputed from the profiles of the P100 analytes.  The resulting profiles are suitable for molecular signature generation, querying of signatures across cell perturbations and types, and modeling of response networks in cellular systems."

PLX4032 KiNativ -- dose response experiment,"The KiNativ assay platform is based on the use of biotinylated acyl phosphates of ATP or ADP that act as probes by reacting with protein kinases on conserved lysine residues in the ATP binding pocket to covalently attach a biotin moiety.  Using these probes, cell lysates treated with a kinase inhibitor can be labeled with BHAcATP or BHAcADP, with kinases inhibited by the compound of interest exhibiting reduced or no labeling.  This is followed by digestion with trypsin, isolation of biotinylated peptides, and analysis by mass spectrometry to determine the extent of labeling of peptides from each kinase."

PI3K inhibitors protect against glucocorticoid-induced skin atrophy.,"BACKGROUND:Skin atrophy is a major adverse effect of topical glucocorticoids. We recently reported that REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage 1) and FKBP51 (FK506 binding protein 5), negative regulators of mTOR/Akt signaling, are induced by glucocorticoids in mouse and human skin and are central drivers of steroid skin atrophy. Thus, we hypothesized that REDD1/FKBP51 inhibitors could protect skin against catabolic effects of glucocorticoids. METHODS:Using drug repurposing approach, we screened LINCS library (http://lincsproject.org/LINCS/) to identify repressors of REDD1/FKBP51 expression. Candidate compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit glucocorticoid-induced REDD1/FKBP51 expression in human primary/immortalized keratinocytes and in mouse skin. Reporter gene expression, microarray, and chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to evaluate effect of these inhibitors on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling. FINDINGS:Bioinformatics analysis unexpectedly identified phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR/Akt inhibitors as a pharmacological class of REDD1/FKBP51 repressors. Selected PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors-Wortmannin (WM), LY294002, AZD8055, and two others indeed blocked REDD1/FKBP51expression in human keratinocytes. PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors also modified global effect of glucocorticoids on trascriptome, shifting it towards therapeutically important transrepression; negatively impacted GR phosphorylation; nuclear translocation; and GR loading on REDD1/FKBP51 gene promoters. Further, topical application of LY294002 together with glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA) protected mice against FA-induced proliferative block and skin atrophy but did not alter the anti-inflammatory activity of FA in ear edema test. INTERPRETATION:Our results built a strong foundation for development of safer GR-targeted therapies for inflammatory skin diseases using combination of glucocorticoids with PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors. FUND: Work is supported by NIH grants R01GM112945, R01AI125366, and HESI-THRIVE foundation."
FOXM1 functions collaboratively with PLAU to promote gastric cancer progression.,"Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the main mortality cause worldwide. Previously, we found Forkhead box protein (FOXM1) or Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) are independent prognostic markers of GC. This study aims to explore the combining prognostic efficacy and the potential insights underlying additive effect of FOXM1 to PLAU in GC progression through in-silico analyses. Method: The expression of FOXM1 and PLAU were profiled in 33 cancer types using public data. A merged GC expression dataset containing 598 samples was used for evaluating prognostic significance of FOXM1/PLAU. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying FOXM1/PLAU promoted GC progression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used for analyzing the association between FOXM1/PLAU and tumor immune infiltration. Genomic and proteomic differences between FOXM1+PLAU+ and FOXM1-PLAU- groups were also computed using TCGA GC data. Drugs targeting FOXM1/PLAU associated gene expression pattern was analyzed using LINCs database. Results: FOXM1 and PLAU are overexpressed in 17/33 cancer types including GC. Kaplan-Meier analyses indicate that the FOXM1+PLAU+ subgroup have the worst prognosis, while FOXM1-PLAU- subgroup have the best survival. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that FOXM1+PLAU+ associated genes are enriched in TGF-beta, DNA repair and drug resistance signaling pathways; FOXM1 and PLAU expression are negatively correlated with tumor immune infiltration. Genomic and proteomic differences between FOXM1+PLAU+ and FOXM1-PLAU- groups were presented. Data mining from LINCs suggested several chemicals or drugs that could target the gene expression pattern of FOXM1+PLAU+ patients. Conclusion: FOXM1+PLAU+ can serve as effective prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for GC. Due to the additive effect of these two genes, screening for drugs or chemicals that targeting the expression patterns PLAU+FOXM1+ subgroup may exert important clinical impact on GC management."

Datasets Used in Evaluation Of RNAi And CRISPR Technologies By Large Scale Gene Expression Profiling In The Connectivity Map,"This GEO Series contains datasets used in the paper ""Evaluation Of RNAi And CRISPR Technologies By Large Scale Gene Expression Profiling In The Connectivity Map"".  The application of RNA interference (RNAi) to mammalian cells has provided the means to perform phenotypic screens to determine the functions of genes. Although RNAi has revolutionized loss of function genetic experiments, it has been difficult to systematically assess the prevalence and consequences of off-target effects. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) represents an unprecedented resource to study the gene expression consequences of expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Analysis of signatures for over 13,000 shRNAs applied in 9 cell lines revealed that miRNA-like off-target effects of RNAi are far stronger and more pervasive than generally appreciated. We show that mitigating off-target effects is feasible in these datasets via computational methodologies to produce a Consensus Gene Signature (CGS). In addition, we compared RNAi technology to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based knockout by analysis of 373 sgRNAs in 6 cells lines, and show that the on-target efficacies are comparable, but CRISPR technology is far less susceptible to systematic off-target effects. These results will help guide the proper use and analysis of loss-of-function reagents for the determination of gene function.  Note: Related GEO projects include a large corpus of additional L1000 data, available at GSE92742.The Platform is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilonhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL20573For questions or assistance with this dataset, please email the CMap support team at: clue@broadinstitute.org
The datasets in this Series were generated as part of the LINCS project, which aims to enable a functional understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents. The Broad Institute LINCS Center for Transcriptomics contributes to this collaborative effort by application of the Connectivity Map concept. In brief, the study design involves the generation of a compendium of transcriptional expression data from cultured human cells treated with small-molecule and genetic loss/gain of function perturbagens. These measurements are made using the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay that enables data generation at an unprecedented scale.  The data provided here include Levels 4 and 5, as well as additional data described in the README:  Level 4 (Z-SCORES) - signatures with differentially expressed genes computed by robust z-scores for each profile relative to control (PC relative to plate population as control; VC relative to vehicle control). Level 5 (SIG) consists of the replicates, usually 3 per treatment, aggregated into a single differential expression vector derived from the weighted averages of the individual replicates.

"A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 Platform and the First 1,000,000 Profiles.","We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io."
Measuring Cancer Drug Sensitivity and Resistance in Cultured Cells.,"Measuring the potencies of small-molecule drugs in cell lines is a critical aspect of preclinical pharmacology. Such experiments are also prototypical of high-throughput experiments in multi-well plates. The procedure is simple in principle, but many unrecognized factors can affect the results, potentially making data unreliable. The procedures for measuring drug response described here were developed by the NIH LINCS program to improve reproducibility. Key features include maximizing uniform cell growth during the assay period, accounting for the effects of cell density on response, and correcting sensitivity measures for differences in proliferation rates. Two related protocols are described: one involves an endpoint measure well-suited to large-scale studies and the second is a time-dependent measurement that reveals changes in response over time. The methods can be adapted to other types of plate-based experiments. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."
On transformative adaptive activation functions in neural networks for gene expression inference.,"Gene expression profiling was made more cost-effective by the NIH LINCS program that profiles only ?1, 000 selected landmark genes and uses them to reconstruct the whole profile. The D-GEX method employs neural networks to infer the entire profile. However, the original D-GEX can be significantly improved. We propose a novel transformative adaptive activation function that improves the gene expression inference even further and which generalizes several existing adaptive activation functions. Our improved neural network achieves an average mean absolute error of 0.1340, which is a significant improvement over our reimplementation of the original D-GEX, which achieves an average mean absolute error of 0.1637. The proposed transformative adaptive function enables a significantly more accurate reconstruction of the full gene expression profiles with only a small increase in the complexity of the model and its training procedure compared to other methods."

The Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to find associations between genomic features and gene expression levels. As part of this project, aliquots of mRNA obtained from 3,176 patient-derived samples from 30 tissue types were profiled on two contemporary gene expression platforms; RNAseq and L1000, a high-throughput gene-expression assay that enables data generation at an unprecedented scale. In L1000, the data are processed through a computational system that converts raw fluorescence intensities into normalized expression profiles generating level 3 (Q2NORM) - gene expression profiles of both directly measured landmark transcripts plus inferred genes. Normalization is done using invariant set scaling followed by quantile normalization. The RNAseq data were collected using Illumina TrueSeq RNA sequencing and converted into reads per kilobase-million (RPKM) units. These RPKM data and underlying read count files are available via the GTEx portal (http://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). In this series, the RPKM data were also log2-scaled and quantile normalized as a cohort."

Abstract
Context: The OutSystems Platform is a development environment composed of several DSLs, used to specify, quickly build and validate web and mobile applications. The DSLs allow users to model different perspectives such as interfaces and data models, define custom business logic and construct process models.
Problem: TheDSL for process modelling (Business Process Technology (BPT)), has a low adoption rate and is perceived as having usability problems hampering its adoption. This is problematic given the language maintenance costs.
Method: We used a combination of interviews, a critical review of BPT using the “Physics of Notation” and empirical evaluations of BPT using the System Usability Scale (SUS)and the NASA Task Load indeX (TLX), to develop a new version ofBPT, taking these inputs and Outsystems’ engineers culture into account.
Results: Evaluations conducted with 25 professional soft-ware engineers showed an increase of the semantic transparency on the new version, from 31% to 69%, an increase in the correctness of responses, from 51% to 89%, an increase in the SUS score, from 42.25 to 64.78, and a decrease of the TLX score, from 36.50 to 20.78. These differences were statistically significant.
Conclusions: These results suggest the new version of BPT significantly improved the developer experience of the previous version. The end users background with OutSystems had a relevant impact on the final concrete syntax choices and achieved usability indicators.

New ways to boost molecular dynamics simulations.,"We describe a set of algorithms that allow to simulate dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, a common benchmark) with the AMBER all-atom force field at 160 nanoseconds/day on a single Intel Core i7 5960X CPU (no graphics processing unit (GPU), 23,786 atoms, particle mesh Ewald (PME), 8.0 Å cutoff, correct atom masses, reproducible trajectory, CPU with 3.6 GHz, no turbo boost, 8 AVX registers). The new features include a mixed multiple time-step algorithm (reaching 5 fs), a tuned version of LINCS to constrain bond angles, the fusion of pair list creation and force calculation, pressure coupling with a ""densostat,"" and exploitation of new CPU instruction sets like AVX2. The impact of Intel's new transactional memory, atomic instructions, and sloppy pair lists is also analyzed. The algorithms map well to GPUs and can automatically handle most Protein Data Bank (PDB) files including ligands. An implementation is available as part of the YASARA molecular modeling and simulation program from www.YASARA.org."
HG-6-64-01 KiNativ -- single dose experiment,"The KiNativ assay platform is based on the use of biotinylated acyl phosphates of ATP or ADP that act as probes by reacting with protein kinases on conserved lysine residues in the ATP binding pocket to covalently attach a biotin moiety.  Using these probes, cell lysates treated with a kinase inhibitor can be labeled with BHAcATP or BHAcADP, with kinases inhibited by the compound of interest exhibiting reduced or no labeling.  This is followed by digestion with trypsin, isolation of biotinylated peptides, and analysis by mass spectrometry to determine the extent of labeling of peptides from each kinase."

Drug/Cell-line Browser: interactive canvas visualization of cancer drug/cell-line viability assay datasets.,"Recently, several high profile studies collected cell viability data from panels of cancer cell lines treated with many drugs applied at different concentrations. Such drug sensitivity data for cancer cell lines provide suggestive treatments for different types and subtypes of cancer. Visualization of these datasets can reveal patterns that may not be obvious by examining the data without such efforts. Here we introduce Drug/Cell-line Browser (DCB), an online interactive HTML5 data visualization tool for interacting with three of the recently published datasets of cancer cell lines/drug-viability studies. DCB uses clustering and canvas visualization of the drugs and the cell lines, as well as a bar graph that summarizes drug effectiveness for the tissue of origin or the cancer subtypes for single or multiple drugs. DCB can help in understanding drug response patterns and prioritizing drug/cancer cell line interactions by tissue of origin or cancer subtype.DCB is an open source Web-based tool that is freely available at: http://www.maayanlab.net/LINCS/DCB CONTACT: avi.maayan@mssm.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
Holistic optimization of an RNA-seq workflow for multi-threaded environments.,"SUMMARY:For many next generation-sequencing pipelines, the most computationally intensive step is the alignment of reads to a reference sequence. As a result, alignment software such as the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner is optimized for speed and is often executed in parallel on the cloud. However, there are other less demanding steps that can also be optimized to significantly increase the speed especially when using many threads. We demonstrate this using a unique molecular identifier RNA-sequencing pipeline consisting of 3 steps: split, align, and merge. Optimization of all three steps yields a 40% increase in speed when executed using a single thread. However, when executed using 16 threads, we observe a 4-fold improvement over the original parallel implementation and more than an 8-fold improvement over the original single-threaded implementation. In contrast, optimizing only the alignment step results in just a 13% improvement over the original parallel workflow using 16 threads.

Connectivity Analyses of Bioenergetic Changes in Schizophrenia: Identification of Novel Treatments.,"We utilized a cell-level approach to examine glycolytic pathways in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia (n =?16) and control (n =?16) and found decreased mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes. To replicate these novel bioenergetic findings, we probed independent datasets for bioenergetic targets and found similar abnormalities. Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of ""reversing"" the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens, may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases."
Transcriptomic profiling of human hippocampal progenitor cells treated with antidepressants and its application in drug repositioning.,"Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are ineffective in a significant proportion of patients, and the identification of new antidepressant compounds has been difficult. 'Connectivity mapping' is a method that can be used to identify drugs that elicit similar downstream effects on mRNA levels when compared to current treatments, and thus may point towards possible repositioning opportunities. We investigated genome-wide transcriptomic changes to human hippocampal progenitor cells treated with therapeutically relevant concentrations of a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram). We identified mRNA changes common to both drugs to create an 'antidepressant mRNA signature'. We used this signature to probe the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) and to identify other compounds that elicit similar changes to mRNA in neural progenitor cells. Results from LINCS revealed that the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine elicited mRNA changes most similar to our mRNA signature, and we identified W-7 and vorinostat as functionally relevant drug candidates, which may have repositioning potential. Our results are encouraging and represent the first attempt to use connectivity mapping for drug repositioning in MDD."
Computational Drug Repositioning for Gastric Cancer using Reversal Gene Expression Profiles.,"Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) often produces poor outcomes. Moreover, predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases, respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, selumetinib, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile, GC-related genes such as PLOD3, COL4A1, UBE2C, MIF, and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs. These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug candidates that can be used to treat GC."
Centralized scientific communities are less likely to generate replicable results.,"Concerns have been expressed about the robustness of experimental findings in several areas of science, but these matters have not been evaluated at scale. Here we identify a large sample of published drug-gene interaction claims curated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (for example, benzo(a)pyrene decreases expression of SLC22A3) and evaluate these claims by connecting them with high-throughput experiments from the LINCS L1000 program. Our sample included 60,159 supporting findings and 4253 opposing findings about 51,292 drug-gene interaction claims in 3363 scientific articles. We show that claims reported in a single paper replicate 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9-21.2%) more frequently than expected, while claims reported in multiple papers replicate 45.5% (95% CI, 21.8-74.2%) more frequently than expected. We also analyze the subsample of interactions with two or more published findings (2493 claims; 6272 supporting findings; 339 opposing findings; 1282 research articles), and show that centralized scientific communities, which use similar methods and involve shared authors who contribute to many articles, propagate less replicable claims than decentralized communities, which use more diverse methods and contain more independent teams. Our findings suggest how policies that foster decentralized collaboration will increase the robustness of scientific findings in biomedical research."
In Vitro and In Vivo Pipeline for Validation of Disease-Modifying Effects of Systems Biology-Derived Network Treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury-Lessons Learned.,"We developed a pipeline for the discovery of transcriptomics-derived disease-modifying therapies and used it to validate treatments in vitro and in vivo that could be repurposed for TBI treatment. Desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, sirolimus and trimipramine, identified by in silico LINCS analysis as candidate treatments modulating the TBI-induced transcriptomics networks, were tested in neuron-BV2 microglial co-cultures, using tumour necrosis factor ? as a monitoring biomarker for neuroinflammation, nitrite for nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity and microtubule associated protein 2-based immunostaining for neuronal survival. Based on (a) therapeutic time window in silico, (b) blood-brain barrier penetration and water solubility, (c) anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro (p < 0.05) and (d) target engagement of Nrf2 target genes (p < 0.05), desmethylclomipramine was validated in a lateral fluid-percussion model of TBI in rats. Despite the favourable in silico and in vitro outcomes, in vivo assessment of clomipramine, which metabolizes to desmethylclomipramine, failed to demonstrate favourable effects on motor and memory tests. In fact, clomipramine treatment worsened the composite neuroscore (p < 0.05). Weight loss (p < 0.05) and prolonged upregulation of plasma cytokines (p < 0.05) may have contributed to the worsened somatomotor outcome. Our pipeline provides a rational stepwise procedure for evaluating favourable and unfavourable effects of systems-biology discovered compounds that modulate post-TBI transcriptomics."
Deep Learning Applications for Predicting Pharmacological Properties of Drugs and Drug Repurposing Using Transcriptomic Data.,"Deep learning is rapidly advancing many areas of science and technology with multiple success stories in image, text, voice and video recognition, robotics, and autonomous driving. In this paper we demonstrate how deep neural networks (DNN) trained on large transcriptional response data sets can classify various drugs to therapeutic categories solely based on their transcriptional profiles. We used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines from the LINCS Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH. To train the DNN, we utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled data set of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours. In both pathway and gene level classification, DNN achieved high classification accuracy and convincingly outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) model on every multiclass classification problem, however, models based on pathway level data performed significantly better. For the first time we demonstrate a deep learning neural net trained on transcriptomic data to recognize pharmacological properties of multiple drugs across different biological systems and conditions. We also propose using deep neural net confusion matrices for drug repositioning. This work is a proof of principle for applying deep learning to drug discovery and development."
Transcriptional profiling of LS1034 cells treated with tepoxalin,"LS1034 colorectal cancer cells were treated with DMSO vehicle control or 12 uM tepoxalin for 6 hours.Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have been found on occasion, but such discoveries have been serendipitous and rare. To fully discover activity against multiple tumor types, resource-intensive screening across hundreds of cancer cell lines is needed. We sought to create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we used PRISM, which involves the molecular barcoding of each cell line, followed by pooling of the barcoded lines. Relative barcode abundance following drug treatment versus controls thus reflects cell viability following drug treatment. We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Mechanistic follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms. These results illustrate the potential of the PRISM drug repurposing resource as a starting point for new oncology therapeutic development.

Inhibition of the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor with atracurium activates FOXO/DAF-16-induced longevity (RNA-seq),"Transcriptome-based drug screening is emerging as a powerful tool to identify geroprotective compounds to intervene in age-related disease. We hypothesized that, by mimicking the transcriptional signature of the highly conserved longevity intervention of FOXO3 (daf-16 in worms) overexpression, we could identify and repurpose compounds with similar downstream effects to increase longevity. Our in silico screen, utilizing the LINCS transcriptome database of genetic and compound interventions, identified several FDA-approved compounds that activate FOXO downstream targets in mammalian cells. These included the neuromuscular blocker atracurium, which also robustly extends both lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans. This longevity is dependent on both daf-16 signaling and inhibition of the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor. Other neuromuscular blockers tubocurarine and pancuronium caused similar healthspan benefits. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity to mimic genetic lifespan interventions with drugs, and in doing so, reveal that the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor regulates the highly conserved FOXO/DAF-16 longevity pathway. Overall design: 4 samples each of C. elegans treated for 24 hours from larval stage 4 to day 1 of adulthood with 50 µM atracurium besylate or water vehicle controls"
Systematically studying kinase inhibitor induced signaling network signatures by integrating both therapeutic and side effects.,"Substantial effort in recent years has been devoted to analyzing data based large-scale biological networks, which provide valuable insight into the topologies of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific ligands or compounds. In this work, we proposed a novel strategy to investigate kinase inhibitor induced pathway signatures by integrating multiplex data in Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), e.g. KINOMEscan data and cell proliferation/mitosis imaging data. Using this strategy, we first established a PC9 cell line specific pathway model to investigate the pathway signatures in PC9 cell line when perturbed by a small molecule kinase inhibitor GW843682. This specific pathway revealed the role of PI3K/AKT in modulating the cell proliferation process and the absence of two anti-proliferation links, which indicated a potential mechanism of abnormal expansion in PC9 cell number. Incorporating the pathway model for side effects on primary human hepatocytes, it was used to screen 27 kinase inhibitors in LINCS database and PF02341066, known as Crizotinib, was finally suggested with an optimal concentration 4.6 uM to suppress PC9 cancer cell expansion while avoiding severe damage to primary human hepatocytes. Drug combination analysis revealed that the synergistic effect region can be predicted straightforwardly based on a threshold which is an inherent property of each kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, this integration strategy can be easily extended to other specific cell lines to be a powerful tool for drug screen before clinical trials."

Transcriptomics-Based Drug Repurposing Approach Identifies Novel Drugs against Sorafenib-Resistant Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently diagnosed in patients with late-stage disease who are ineligible for curative surgical therapies. The majority of patients become resistant to sorafenib, the only approved first-line therapy for advanced cancer, underscoring the need for newer, more effective drugs. The purpose of this study is to expedite identification of novel drugs against sorafenib resistant (SR)-HCC. Methods: We employed a transcriptomics-based drug repurposing method termed connectivity mapping using gene signatures from in vitro-derived SR Huh7 HCC cells. For proof of concept validation, we focused on drugs that were FDA-approved or under clinical investigation and prioritized two anti-neoplastic agents (dasatinib and fostamatinib) with targets associated with HCC. We also prospectively validated predicted gene expression changes in drug-treated SR Huh7 cells as well as identified and validated the targets of Fostamatinib in HCC. Results: Dasatinib specifically reduced the viability of SR-HCC cells that correlated with up-regulated activity of SRC family kinases, its targets, in our SR-HCC model. However, fostamatinib was able to inhibit both parental and SR HCC cells in vitro and in xenograft models. Ingenuity pathway analysis of fostamatinib gene expression signature from LINCS predicted JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK pathways as potential targets of fostamatinib that were validated by Western blot analysis. Fostamatinib treatment reversed the expression of genes that were deregulated in SR HCC. Conclusion: We provide proof of concept evidence for the validity of this drug repurposing approach for SR-HCC with implications for personalized medicine."

Transcriptomics-based drug repurposing approach identifies novel drugs against sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently diagnosed in patients with late-stage disease who are ineligible for curative surgical therapies. Furthermore, the majority of patients become resistant to sorafenib. Recently, computational methods for drug repurposing have shown great promise to accelerate the discovery of new uses for existing drugs. In order to identify novel drugs for use against sorafenib resistant (SR)-HCC, we employed a transcriptomics-based drug repurposing method termed connectivity mapping. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of available in vitro and in vivo gene signatures of (SR)-HCC, and generated our own in vitro model using the Huh7 HCC cell line. We compared coverage of SR-HCC gene signatures across seven patient-derived HCC gene expression datasets, and observed that patients harboring the Huh7 SR-HCC gene signature had significantly reduced survival. Utilizing the Huh7 SR-HCC gene signature, we applied connectivity mapping to drug-induced gene expression profiles (n= 3,740 drugs) in the HepG2 HCC cell line from the LINCS database in order to find drugs that could oppose sorafenib resistance. We validated the use of two non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and fostamatinib, to reduce viability of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and confirmed up-regulated activity of Src family kinases, the targets of dasatinib, in our SR-HCC models. We prospectively validated predicted gene expression changes in fostamatinib treated Huh7-SR via RNA-seq analysis. Overall design: Gene expression profiles of Huh7-SR hepatocellular carcinoma cells resistant to sorafenib were generated by RNAseq (Illumina HiSeq 4000) following treatment with fostamatinib and vehicle control."

Transcriptional profiling of SF295 cells following MTF1 knockout by CRISPR/Cas9,"SF295 glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the MTF1 (metal regulatory transcription factor 1) gene or non-targeted control (GFP). Two guides targeting MTF1 and one guide targeting GFP were cloned into the pXPR_023 all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 vector. SF295 cells were transduced by lentiviral infection and selected using puromycin. Following selection, RNA was harvested from cell lines growing in culture. Wild-type SF295 cells were also included as a control.Anti-cancer uses of non-oncology drugs have been found on occasion, but such discoveries have been serendipitous and rare. To fully discover activity against multiple tumor types, resource-intensive screening across hundreds of cancer cell lines is needed. We sought to create a public resource containing the growth inhibitory activity of 4,518 drugs tested across 578 human cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we used PRISM, which involves the molecular barcoding of each cell line, followed by pooling of the barcoded lines. Relative barcode abundance following drug treatment versus controls thus reflects cell viability following drug treatment. We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Mechanistic follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms. These results illustrate the potential of the PRISM drug repurposing resource as a starting point for new oncology therapeutic development.
Eleven biological samples are included in the study. SF295 wild-type cells (control, duplicate), SF295 GFP sg1 (non-targeting guide control, triplicate), SF295 MTF1 sg1 (triplicate), and SF295 MTF1 sg2 (triplicate)."

"Gene expression data of four cancer cell lines (A375, A549, MCF7, and PC3) treated with KR-37524","KR-37524, known as a Urotensin-II receptor antagonist, has low usability due to its low affinity. For this reason, gene expression information was obtained by treating KR-37524 in four cell cancer cell lines to find a new target. The change in gene expression profile was measured and compared with the LINCS L1000 database and used to find a new target.
Six sheets of each cell line were seeded in a 60mm dish and incubated for 24 hours. After 24 hours, DMSO and KR-37524 were diluted 1000-fold in medium and the cells were treated. After 6 hours, the medium was removed and cells were obtained by treatment with 1ml of TRIzol. Cells were disrupted by pipetting and stored in a deep freezer."
STL427944 suppresses FOXM1 via nuclear export and subsequent autophagic degradation,"FOXM1 transcription factor is an oncogene and a crucial regulator of cancer chemoresistance. Existing pharmacological FOXM1 inhibitors attenuate resistance of cancer cells to treatment but exhibit insufficient specificity. We performed in silico screening of small molecules from NIH LINCS database to identify STL427944 compound that suppresses FOXM1 through a novel two-step mechanism. STL427944 treatment induces relocalization of nuclear FOXM1 protein to cytoplasm, where it is subsequently degraded in an autophagosome-dependent manner. Human cancer cells treated with STL427944 exhibit increased sensitivity to cytotoxic effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Transcriptome-based analysis of STL427944-induced gene expression changes revealed prominent suppression of gene signatures characteristic for FOXM1 and its downstream targets but no significant changes in other important regulatory pathways, thereby suggesting high selectivity of STL427944 towards FOXM1. We expect that STL427944 or its derivatives may be used in combination with different chemotherapeutical drugs to overcome tumor chemoresistance and improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Overall design: For each experimental model and condition, two biological replicates were analyzed. Control samples were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO), with vehicle percentage not exceeding 0.3%."
"Analysis of Post-TBI Gene Expression Signature Reveals Tubulins, NFE2L2, NFkB, CD44, and S100A4 as Treatment Targets for Traumatic Brain Injury","TBI was induced with lateral fluid-percussion injury in adult male rats. Genome-wide RNA-seq of the perilesional cortex, ipsilateral thalamus and dorsal hippocampus was performed at 3 months post-TBI. The data highlighted chronic transcriptional changes, particularly, in the perilesional cortex and thalamus. Genes showing a significantly altered expression both in the cortex and thalamus were submitted to the LINCS web query to identify novel pharmacotherapies to improve post-TBI outcome. Overall design: TBI was induced to 5 rats, 5 sham operated served as a controls."
Modulating membrane fluidity corrects Batten disease phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are a class of inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material. The most common neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis has juvenile onset with rapid onset blindness and progressive degeneration of cognitive processes. The juvenile form is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes the protein CLN3. While mouse models of Cln3 deficiency show mild disease phenotypes, it is apparent from patient tissue- and cell-based studies that its loss impacts many cellular processes. Using Cln3 deficient mice, we previously described defects in mouse brain endothelial cells and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Here we expand on this to other components of the BBB and show that Cln3 deficient mice have increased astrocyte endfeet area. Interestingly, this phenotype is corrected by treatment with a commonly used GAP junction inhibitor, carbenoxolone (CBX). In addition to its action on GAP junctions, CBX has also been proposed to alter lipid microdomains. In this work, we show that CBX modifies lipid microdomains and corrects membrane fluidity alterations in Cln3 deficient endothelial cells, which in turn improves defects in endocytosis, caveolin-1 distribution at the plasma membrane, and Cdc42 activity. In further work using the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we discovered other small molecules whose impact was similar to CBX in that they improved Cln3-deficient cell phenotypes. Moreover, Cln3 deficient mice treated orally with CBX exhibited recovery of impaired BBB responses and reduced autofluorescence. CBX and the compounds identified by LINCS, many of which have been used in humans or approved for other indications, may find therapeutic benefit in children suffering from CLN3 deficiency through mechanisms independent of their original intended use."

SigMat: a classification scheme for gene signature matching.,"Motivation:Several large-scale efforts have been made to collect gene expression signatures from a variety of biological conditions, such as response of cell lines to treatment with drugs, or tumor samples with different characteristics. These gene signature collections are utilized through bioinformatics tools for 'signature matching', whereby a researcher studying an expression profile can identify previously cataloged biological conditions most related to their profile. Signature matching tools typically retrieve from the collection the signature that has highest similarity to the user-provided profile. Alternatively, classification models may be applied where each biological condition in the signature collection is a class label; however, such models are trained on the collection of available signatures and may not generalize to the novel cellular context or cell line of the researcher's expression profile. Results:We present an advanced multi-way classification algorithm for signature matching, called SigMat, that is trained on a large signature collection from a well-studied cellular context, but can also classify signatures from other cell types by relying on an additional, small collection of signatures representing the target cell type. It uses these 'tuning data' to learn two additional parameters that help adapt its predictions for other cellular contexts. SigMat outperforms other similarity scores and classification methods in identifying the correct label of a query expression profile from as many as 244 or 500 candidate classes (drug treatments) cataloged by the LINCS L1000 project. SigMat retains its high accuracy in cross-cell line applications even when the amount of tuning data is severely limited. Availability and implementation:SigMat is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JinfengXiao/SigMat. Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Effects of mannose-binding lectin on pulmonary gene expression and innate immune inflammatory response to ozone.,"Ozone is a common, potent oxidant pollutant in industrialized nations. Ozone exposure causes airway hyperreactivity, lung hyperpermeability, inflammation, and cell damage in humans and laboratory animals, and exposure to ozone has been associated with exacerbation of asthma, altered lung function, and mortality. The mechanisms of ozone-induced lung injury and differential susceptibility are not fully understood. Ozone-induced lung inflammation is mediated, in part, by the innate immune system. We hypothesized that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an innate immunity serum protein, contributes to the proinflammatory events caused by ozone-mediated activation of the innate immune system. Wild-type (Mbl(+/+)) and MBL-deficient (Mbl(-/-)) mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for up to 72 h, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was examined for inflammatory markers. Mean numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils and levels of the neutrophil attractants C-X-C motif chemokines 2 [Cxcl2 (major intrinsic protein 2)] and 5 [Cxcl5 (limb expression, LIX)] in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly lower in Mbl(-/-) than Mbl(+/+) mice exposed to ozone. Using genome-wide mRNA microarray analyses, we identified significant differences in transcript response profiles and networks at baseline [e.g., nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response] and after exposure (e.g., humoral immune response) between Mbl(+/+) and Mbl(-/-) mice. The microarray data were further analyzed to discover several informative differential response patterns and subsequent gene sets, including the antimicrobial response and the inflammatory response. We also used the lists of gene transcripts to search the LINCS L1000CDS(2) data sets to identify agents that are predicted to perturb ozone-induced changes in gene transcripts and inflammation. These novel findings demonstrate that targeted deletion of Mbl caused differential levels of inflammation-related gene sets at baseline and after exposure to ozone and significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, thus indicating an important innate immunomodulatory role of the gene in this model."
Drug Gene Budger (DGB): an application for ranking drugs to modulate a specific gene based on transcriptomic signatures.,"SUMMARY:Mechanistic molecular studies in biomedical research often discover important genes that are aberrantly over- or under-expressed in disease. However, manipulating these genes in an attempt to improve the disease state is challenging. Herein, we reveal Drug Gene Budger (DGB), a web-based and mobile application developed to assist investigators in order to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to maximally influence the expression of their target gene of interest. With DGB, users can enter a gene symbol along with the wish to up-regulate or down-regulate its expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of small molecules that have been experimentally determined to produce the desired expression effect. The table includes log-transformed fold change, P-value and q-value for each small molecule, reporting the significance of differential expression as determined by the limma method. Relevant links are provided to further explore knowledge about the target gene, the small molecule and the source of evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene was derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures extracted from the LINCS L1000 dataset, the original Connectivity Map (CMap) dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DGB also presents a specificity measure for a drug-gene connection based on the number of genes a drug modulates. DGB provides a useful preliminary technique for identifying small molecules that can target the expression of a single gene in human cells and tissues. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:The application is freely available on the web at http://DGB.cloud and as a mobile phone application on iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drug-gene-budger/id1243580241? mt=8 and Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details? id=com.drgenebudger.

Screening of Drug Repositioning Candidates for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Purpose: Most prostate cancers (PCs) initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but eventually many PC patients develop castration resistant PC (CRPC). Currently, available drugs that have been approved for the treatment of CRPC patients are limited. Computational drug repositioning methods using public databases represent a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. The purpose of the present study is to predict drug candidates that can treat CRPC using a computational method that integrates publicly available gene expression data of tumors from CRPC patients, drug-induced gene expression data and drug response activity data. Methods: Gene expression data from tumoral and normal or benign prostate tissue samples in CRPC patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CRPC were determined with a meta-signature analysis by a metaDE R package. Additionally, drug activity data were downloaded from the ChEMBL database. Furthermore, the drug-induced gene expression data were downloaded from the LINCS database. The reversal relationship between the CRPC and drug gene expression signatures as the Reverse Gene Expression Scores (RGES) were computed. Drug candidates to treat CRPC were predicted using summarized scores (sRGES). Additionally, synergic effects of drug combinations were predicted with a Target Inhibition interaction using the Minimization and Maximization Averaging (TIMMA) algorithm. Results: The drug candidates of sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for the treatment of CRPC. Meanwhile, CRPC-related genes, in this case MYL9, E2F2, APOE, and ZFP36, were identified as having gene expression data that can be reversed by these drugs. Additionally, lenalidomide in combination with pazopanib was predicted to be most potent for CRPC. Conclusion: These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug and drug combination candidates that can be used to treat CRPC."
Translating in vitro CFTR rescue into small molecule correctors for cystic fibrosis using the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures drug discovery platform,"Cystic fibrosis is a lethal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The common delF508-CFTR mutation results in protein misfolding and proteasomal degradation. If delF508-CFTR trafficks to the cell surface, its anion channel function may be partially restored. Several in vitro strategies can partially correct delF508-CFTR trafficking and function, including low-temperature, small molecules, overexpression of miR-138, or knockdown of SIN3A. The challenge remains to translate such interventions into therapies and to understand their mechanisms. One approach for connecting such interventions to small molecule therapies that has previously succeeded for cystic fibrosis and other diseases is via mRNA expression profiling and iterative searches of small molecules with similar expression signatures. Here, we query the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) using transcriptomic signatures from previously generated CF expression data, including RNAi- and low temperature-based rescue signatures. This LINCS in silico screen prioritized 135 small molecules that mimicked our rescue interventions based on their genome-wide transcriptional perturbations. Functional screens of these small molecules identified nine compounds that partially restored delF508-CFTR function, as assessed by cAMP-activated chloride conductance. Of these, XL147 rescued delF508-CFTR function in primary CF airway epithelia, while also showing cooperativity when administered with C18. Improved CF corrector therapies are greatly needed and this integrative drug prioritization approach offers a novel method to both identify small molecules that may rescue delF508-CFTR function and identify gene networks underlying such rescue."
Transcriptomic metaanalyses of autistic brains reveals shared gene expression and biological pathway abnormalities with cancer.,"Background:Epidemiological and clinical evidence points to cancer as a comorbidity in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A significant overlap of genes and biological processes between both diseases has also been reported. Methods:Here, for the first time, we compared the gene expression profiles of ASD frontal cortex tissues and 22 cancer types obtained by differential expression meta-analysis and report gene, pathway, and drug set-based overlaps between them. Results:Four cancer types (brain, thyroid, kidney, and pancreatic cancers) presented a significant overlap in gene expression deregulations in the same direction as ASD whereas two cancer types (lung and prostate cancers) showed differential expression profiles significantly deregulated in the opposite direction from ASD. Functional enrichment and LINCS L1000 based drug set enrichment analyses revealed the implication of several biological processes and pathways that were affected jointly in both diseases, including impairments of the immune system, and impairments in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis among others. Our data also suggest that brain and kidney cancer have patterns of transcriptomic dysregulation in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR axis that are similar to those found in ASD. Conclusions:Comparisons of ASD and cancer differential gene expression meta-analysis results suggest that brain, kidney, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers are candidates for direct comorbid associations with ASD. On the other hand, lung and prostate cancers are candidates for inverse comorbid associations with ASD. Joint perturbations in a set of specific biological processes underlie these associations which include several pathways previously implicated in both cancer and ASD encompassing immune system alterations, impairments of energy metabolism, cell cycle, and signaling through PI3K and G protein-coupled receptors among others. These findings could help to explain epidemiological observations pointing towards direct and inverse comorbid associations between ASD and specific cancer types and depict a complex scenario regarding the molecular patterns of association between ASD and cancer."
LINCS-NeuroLINCS,"""The NeuroLINCS Center is part of the NIH Common Fund''s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize how a variety of human cells, tissues and the entire organism respond to perturbations by drugs and other molecular factors.

Inhibition of the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor with atracurium activates FOXO/DAF-16-induced longevity (RNA-seq),"Transcriptome-based drug screening is emerging as a powerful tool to identify geroprotective compounds to intervene in age-related disease. We hypothesized that, by mimicking the transcriptional signature of the highly conserved longevity intervention of FOXO3 (daf-16 in worms) overexpression, we could identify and repurpose compounds with similar downstream effects to increase longevity. Our in silico screen, utilizing the LINCS transcriptome database of genetic and compound interventions, identified several FDA-approved compounds that activate FOXO downstream targets in mammalian cells. These included the neuromuscular blocker atracurium, which also robustly extends both lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans. This longevity is dependent on both daf-16 signaling and inhibition of the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor. Other neuromuscular blockers tubocurarine and pancuronium caused similar healthspan benefits. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity to mimic genetic lifespan interventions with drugs, and in doing so, reveal that the neuromuscular acetylcholine receptor regulates the highly conserved FOXO/DAF-16 longevity pathway.

Regulation of TROP2 expression in breast cancer,"Expression of genes highly correlated with TACSTD2 expression in breast tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and found that 29 genes were overlapping between in 18 breast cancer samples and matching PDXs.  Among these genes, TACSTD2 expression strongly correlated with expression of epithelial marker CDH1 (E-Cadherin) (r2=0.823; p<0.001).  Expression of TACSTD2 was then compared to expression of CDH1 in breast cancer cell lines from The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (N = 51) and The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) (N = 35).  There was also a significant correlation between TACSTD2 and CDH1 in both CCLE (r2=0.564, p < 0.001) and LINCS (r2= 0.755; p < 0.001).

Multi-omics Analysis reveals novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises the majority (~85%) of all lung tumors, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) being the most frequently diagnosed histological subtypes. Currently, multi-modal omics profiles had been carried out in NSCLC, but no studies reported yet a systems biology approach to provide a complete picture of molecular perturbations specifically for LUAD and LUSC.
In this study, we integrated transcriptomics, metabolomics and adducteomics for the first time to analyze 30 paired human lung tumors and adjacent noncancerous tissues. We portrayed unique metabolite related gene signatures to distinguish LUAD from LUSC and several altered pathways aberrantly expressed at both transcriptional and metabolic levels. Additionally, the integration studies revealed a 28-metabolite gene signature in TCGA-LUAD cohort and demonstrated a significant association with survival, especially for 6 metabolite related genes as therapeutic targets. To further explore, we identified AZD-6482, a clinical trial drug from LINCS/connectivity map and found that it significantly inhibited 3 genes from the 28-gene signature. By integrating adducteomics, we found a differential expression of 307 genes correlated with 6 DNA adducts in LUSC although LUAD did not show much correlation. We found that γ-hydroxy-propanodeoxyguanosine (γ-OH-PdG) is the major DNA adduct formed in LUSC, but not in adjacent noncancerous tissue and significantly correlated with 295 modulated genes as well. We also have identified aberrant signaling pathways for each specific DNA adducts in LUSC compared to adjacent normal. Overall, we have provided a broad picture of integration of omics that can distinguish LUAD and LUSC, prediction of patient survival and identification of therapeutic targets and anticancer drugs. Ultimately, genes modulated by DNA adducts in LUSC could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for cigarette smoke induced lung cancer."
Encoding growth factor identity in the temporal dynamics of FoxO3 under the combinatorial control of ERK and AKT Kinases,"Sampattavanich et al., Cell Systems (2018)

This data repository provides raw datasets for accompanying the paper, ""Encoding growth factor identity in the temporal dynamics of FoxO3 under combinatorial regulation by ERK and Akt"" by Sampattavanich et al., Cell Systems (2018)

Synopsis:
Forkhead box O3 transcription factor (FoxO3) functions as an integrative node for diverse upstream signaling networks, and has been implicated in a number of biological processes including cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cell migration and cell metabolism. Regulators of FoxO3, including phosphorylation, energy stress, genotoxic stress, and cytokines, control its abundance, subcellular localization and DNA-binding capacity. In this paper we study how the identities and concentrations of growth factors are encoded in the dynamics of FoxO3 activation. Transcription factors like FoxO3 often switch between on and off states repeatedly over the course of a 12-24 hours period. Immunoblotting and similar methods can obscure this switching behavior due to asynchronicity between cells. In contrast, our use of time-lapse microscopy of fluorescent reporter proteins reveals that FoxO3 exhibits complex low wavelength and pulsatile translocation dynamics responsive to combinatorial control by ERK and Akt with the potential to encode the identities and concentrations of multiple extracellular growth factors.

Paper accepted for publication in the 6th International Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2018)
 
Abstract 
 Context: A significant effort has been devoted to the design and implementation of various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) for the software agents domain.
Problem: Language usability is often tackled in an ad-hoc way, with the collection of anecdotal evidence supporting the process. However, usability plays an important role in the productivity, learnability and, ultimately, in the adoption of a MAS DSML by agent developers.
Method: In this paper, we apply the principles of The “Physics” of Notations (PoN) to improve the visual notation of a MAS DSML, called SEA_ML and evaluate the result in terms of usability.
Results: The evolved version of the language, SEA_ML++, was perceived as significantly improved in terms of icons comprehensibility, adequacy and usability, as a direct result of employing the principles of PoN. However, users were not significantly more efficient and effective with SEA_ML++, suggesting these two properties were not chiefly constrained by the identified shortcomings of the SEA_ML concrete syntax.
Study Participants
Summary. This evaluation is comprised of a set of studies, each with its own subset of participants. No participants were involved in more than one study.

Symbol selection study (25 participants)
Concrete syntax evaluation experiment (24 + 12 participants)

Participants in the symbol selection study. The symbol selection experiment had 25 participants, 20 males, 5 females, all trained in Computer Science. Of these, 5 had completed their MSc, 16 their BSc and 4 were undergraduate Computer Science students at UNL. 11 had learned about MAS in the context of a course (although not using any of the particular languages in this experiment). The remaining 14 were not familiar with MAS. 9 participants had learned about the semantic web in the context of a course, 9 had only informal knowledge about it and the remaining 7 were not familiar with the semantic web.
More details concerning the development of the SEA_ML++ version of SEA_ML can be found in: SEA_MLPoN.pdf .
Participants in the concrete syntax evaluation experiment. This evaluation experiment was run as a pair of replicated studies. The first replica was run in Universidade Nova de Lisboa, in Portugal. The second replica was run in the International Computer Institute, Ege University, Izmir, in Turkey.

UNL evaluation. At UNL we had 24 participants, including 19 males and 5 females, all trained in Computer Science. Of these, 8 have completed their MSc, 15 their BSc and 1 is an undergraduate Computer Science student. 12 of them had learned about MAS in the context of a course (although not using any of the particular languages in this experiment), and 1 had only informal knowledge about MAS. The remaining 11 were not familiar with MAS. 14 participants had learned about semantic web in the context of a course, 5 had informal knowledge about it, while 4 were not familiar with the semantic web. 
EGE evaluation. At Ege University, we had 12 participants, all Computer Science graduate students who had learned about MAS in the context of a course.

 
Case studies
Music Trader. In this case study, participants are requested to develop a system that allows agents to trade their music albums without using any currency. Agents want to trade their music albums for other albums, with this trade being made on an N to N basis (Agent A wants to trade the album A1 for the album B1 from Agent B and vice versa). Agents are not able to trade more than one album for only one album.)
Expert Finding. In this case study, participants are requested to develop a system that allows agents to find information about other agents that they are searching for in order to communicate with them. Agents have some information about the other agent they are looking for (they are family related or were friends at the past), which is crucial in order to find the correct SemanticWeb Service to search the right person. The communication between agents can be made through Social Networks, E-Mail, VoIP or Phone Call. This case study is an adaptation of the case study ""Expert Finding"" for an evaluation of SEA_ML.
Exercises
Each case study presents the participants with 2 different exercises (4 exercises in total). Each exercise has a description that defines all variables of the system to be modeled. For each exercise, an incomplete version of this system is presented. Participants should read the description that is provided to them and compare to the model they have in hands. When the participant thinks the model is according to the description, the exercise is complete, passing to an inquiry about the system they have modeled and afterward to the next exercise. Each exercise should take around 10 minutes to be completed. The total experiment should take around 40 minutes.
A short description of each exercise is as follows:
1. Music Trader: Exercise 1 — In this exercise, the participants will be modeling the M.A.S viewpoint. An environment and one customer are missing from the original model. A model is presented to the participant for this exercise (either in SEA_ML or in SEA_ML++).
2. Music Trader: Exercise 2 — In this exercise, the participants will be modeling the Agent-SWS viewpoint. A SS_RegisterPlan is missing from the original model. A model is presented to the participant for this exercise (either in SEA_ML or in SEA_ML++).
3. Expert Finding: Exercise 1 — In this exercise, the participants will be modeling the Agent Internal viewpoint. A goal, a belief and a behavior (and its respective connections) are missing from the original model. A model is presented to the participant for this exercise (either in SEA_ML or in SEA_ML++).
4. Expert Finding: Exercise 2—In this exercise, the participants will be modeling the Ontology viewpoint. A fact and a semantic web organization are missing from the original model. A model is presented to the participant for this exercise (either in SEA_ML or in SEA_ML++).
 
How does the usage of SEA_ML vs SEA_ML++ affect the effectiveness and efficiency of developers?
Summary. We briefly present the data analysis for comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of developers with the case studies, using SEA_ML and SEA_ML++. The data collection was performed in two replicate experiments: one conducted in Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the other in EGE University. The tasks and experimental design were identical and planned so that we are able to aggregate the results. In the end, we outline how the data collected in each of these replications compares with each other.
Descriptive statistics. We start by presenting the descriptive statistics for the correctness and duration of the task. The correction is measured as the percentage of elements correctly identified by participants in our case studies. The duration measures how long it took them to perform the task (see CorrectnessEfficiencyDescriptives.pdf). 
Normality tests. We conducted a Kolmogorov-Smirnov and a Shapiro-Wilk tests to check for normality. Neither the correctness nor the duration have a normal distribution, p < 0.001 (see CorrectnessEfficiencyNormality.pdf).
Hypothesis testing. Our null hypotheses are that:

Using SEA_ML and SEA_ML++ has no impact in the correctness of the answers provided by our participants.
Using SEA_ML and SEA_ML++ has no impact in the duration of the tasks performed by our participants.

We summarize the main descriptive statistics here. We note a slight increase from .8021 to .8368 in the achieved correctness and a slight decrease in the mean time to complete the tasks, from 14m48s to 13m20s (see CorrectnessEfficiencySummary.pdf).
We can visually compare the distributions of correctness and duration, depending on the particular version of the language. Concerning correctness, as we can observe, the mode is 1.00 for both languages, although the distribution seems to be more skewed towards the highest rank. The values below 1.00 are considered extreme values, for SEA_ML++, meaning they are relatively scarce. It was relatively infrequent not to obtain maximum correctness with SEA_ML++ (see CorrectnessBoxplot.pdf).
Concerning duration, the distributions are even more similar (see EfficiencyBoxplot.pdf). 
In order to assess whether there is any statistically significant difference between correctness using SEA_ML vs SEA_ML++ and between duration, again using SEA_ML vs SEA_ML++, we conducted a Welch T test, which is robust to deviations from normality, unequal sample sizes and does not assume equal variances of the compared variables (see WelchTTestCorrectnessEfficiency.pdf).
The correctness does not differ significantly, according to Welch’s t-test, t(141.968) = .417, p=.519 from the SEA_ML (M = .80,  SD = .32) to the SEA_ML++ (M = .84, SD = .32) concrete syntax. These results suggest that there was no difference between the two concrete syntaxes, in terms of complexity.
The duration does not differ significantly, according to Welch’s t-test, t(122.030) = 1.180, p = .280 from the SEA_ML (M = 14 : 48, SD = 09 : 32) to SEA_ML++ (M = 13 : 20, SD = 06 : 12) concrete syntax. These results suggest that there was no difference between the two concrete syntaxes, in terms of duration.
Conclusions
The slight differences are not statistically significant. We found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that using SEA_ML++ instead of SEA_ML leads to more correct models. Likewise, we also did not find evidence supporting the hypothesis that using SEA_ML++ instead of SEA_ML will make practitioners reduce the duration of this task.

TRANSCRIPT drug repurposing dataset,"Version 2.0.0 (05/29/2023)
This is a drug repurposing dataset under MIT licence, compiled by Dr. Clémence Réda <clemence.reda@uni-rostock.de> at Universität Rostock, comprising a drug-disease association matrix, and several drug-drug and disease-disease similarity matrices. It only uses transcriptomic data (i.e., gene activity/expression). The sparsity number is the percentage of nonzero values in the association matrix.
# drugs | # diseases | Sparsity number | # positive associations | # negative associations | # genes
------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------
204     | 116        | 0.44%           | 401                     | 11                      | 12,096
All drugs (resp., diseases) are associated with a gene expression feature vector of length 12,096 (that is, all drugs and diseases in the feature matrices appear in the association matrix, and vice versa).
----------
This dataset consists of three .CSV files:
* Drug-Disease Association Matrix
1. ""ratings_mat.csv""
This matrix contains values in {-1,0,1} where -1 stands for a negative association (i.e., the drug failed for some reason to treat the considered disease: e.g., lack of accrual in the associated clinical trial, or proven toxicity), 1 for a positive association (i.e., the drug was shown to treat the disease), and 0 for unknown associated status. The columns are diseases, identified by their MedGen Concept ID, whereas rows are drugs, identified by their DrugBank IDs or PubChem CIDs.
* Drug Feature Matrix
1. ""items.csv""
This matrix has drugs in its columns, identified by their DrugBank IDs or PubChem CIDs, and genes in its rows, identified by their HUGO Gene Symbol. Genewise transcriptomic variation induced by drug treatment, from the CREEDS or the LINCS L1000 databases.
* Disease Feature Matrix
1. ""users.csv""
This matrix has diseases in its columns, identified by their MedGen Concept IDs, and genes in its rows, identified by their HUGO Gene Symbol. Genewise transcriptomic variation induced by the disease, from the CREEDS database.
----------

STL427944 suppresses FOXM1 via nuclear export and subsequent autophagic degradation,"FOXM1 transcription factor is an oncogene and a crucial regulator of cancer chemoresistance. Existing pharmacological FOXM1 inhibitors attenuate resistance of cancer cells to treatment but exhibit insufficient specificity. We performed in silico screening of small molecules from NIH LINCS database to identify STL427944 compound that suppresses FOXM1 through a novel two-step mechanism. STL427944 treatment induces relocalization of nuclear FOXM1 protein to cytoplasm, where it is subsequently degraded in an autophagosome-dependent manner. Human cancer cells treated with STL427944 exhibit increased sensitivity to cytotoxic effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Transcriptome-based analysis of STL427944-induced gene expression changes revealed prominent suppression of gene signatures characteristic for FOXM1 and its downstream targets but no significant changes in other important regulatory pathways, thereby suggesting high selectivity of STL427944 towards FOXM1. We expect that STL427944 or its derivatives may be used in combination with different chemotherapeutical drugs to overcome tumor chemoresistance and improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy.
For each experimental model and condition, two biological replicates were analyzed. Control samples were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO), with vehicle percentage not exceeding 0.3%."
Data from: Gut microbiome critically impacts PCB-induced changes in metabolic fingerprints and the hepatic transcriptome in mice,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitously detected in the environment and have been linked to metabolic diseases. The liver serves as a central hub for the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. Gut dysbiosis is recognized as a critical regulator of disease susceptibility, however, little is known regarding how PCBs and gut microbiome interact to modulate the interface between xenobiotic and intermediary metabolism. We hypothesized that the gut microbiome regulates PCBs-mediated changes in the metabolic fingerprints and hepatic transcriptome. Ninety-day-old female conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to the PCB Fox River Mixture (synthetic PCB mixture, 6 or 30 mg/kg) or corn oil (vehicle control, 10 ml/kg), once daily for 3 consecutive days. Organs were collected 24 hours after the final dose. RNA-Seq was conducted on liver, and endogenous aqueous metabolites (amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides) were measured in liver and serum by LC-MS. The primary factor in clustering the transcriptomic and metabolomic signatures within the same exposure was by enterotype. The numbers of PCB-regulated genes were higher in CV than in GF conditions. The prototypical target genes of the major xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors AhR, PXR, and CAR were more readily up-regulated by PCBs in CV than in GF conditions, indicating the effect of PCBs on the hepatic transcriptome act partly through the gut microbiome. Xenobiotic and steroid metabolism pathways were up-regulated, whereas response to incorrect proteins pathway was down-regulated by PCBs in a gut microbiome-dependent manner. At the high PCB dose, NADP and arginine appear to interact with drug-metabolizing enzymes (Cyp1-3 family, DhcR7, and Nqo1), which are highly correlated with Anaerotruncus and Roseburia in CV mice, providing a novel explanation of gut-liver interaction in toxicant exposures. In GF exposure groups, hepatic glucose was down-regulated, whereas fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate were up-regulated, indicating increased glucose utilization potentiated by lack of gut microbiota. Through querying the LINCS L1000 chemical database, Enrichr predicted that therapeutic drugs targeting the anti-inflammatory and ER stress pathways are potential remedies to mitigate PCB toxicity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that habitation of the gut microbiota drives PCBs-mediated hepatic responses, possibly due to crosstalk between gut and liver. "
