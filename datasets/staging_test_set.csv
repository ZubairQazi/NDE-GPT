33333024,"We performed genome-wide CRISPR KO screens in human Huh7.5.1 cells to select for mutations that render host cells resistant to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E and OC43.","The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that cause disease in humans ranging from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding host factors common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinases and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle and the development of host-directed therapies.","['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects', 'COVID-19/*genetics/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Common Cold/genetics/virology', 'Coronavirus/classification/*physiology', 'Coronavirus Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis', 'SARS-CoV-2/*physiology', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Internalization/drug effects', 'Virus Replication']","['cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Synthetic biology', 'Pathway ID (Panther)', 'Panther Pathways entry format', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'CWL', 'Genbank common name', 'RNAVirusDB ID', 'Virus identifier', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Virus annotation', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'DNA replication and recombination']"
29116155,"CRISPR-cas9 mutagenesis plasmid Tn916 oriT plasmid pKM126, complete sequence","Clostridium difficile is a significant concern as a nosocomial pathogen, and genetic tools are important when analyzing the physiology of such organisms so that the underlying physiology/pathogenesis of the organisms can be studied. Here, we used TargeTron to investigate the role of selenoproteins in C. difficile Stickland metabolism and found that a TargeTron insertion into selD, encoding the selenophosphate synthetase that is essential for the specific incorporation of selenium into selenoproteins, results in a significant growth defect and a global loss of selenium incorporation. However, because of potential polar effects of the TargeTron insertion, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis system for C. difficile. This system rapidly and efficiently introduces site-specific mutations into the C. difficile genome (20-50% mutation frequency). The selD CRISPR deletion mutant had a growth defect in protein-rich medium and mimicked the phenotype of a generated TargeTron selD mutation. Our findings suggest that Stickland metabolism could be a target for future antibiotic therapies and that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can introduce rapid and efficient modifications into the C. difficile genome.","['CRISPR-Associated Protein 9', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Clostridioides difficile/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Editing/*methods', 'Genes, Bacterial/genetics', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Selenium/metabolism', 'Selenoproteins/genetics/*metabolism']","['protein', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'System metadata', 'STRIDE log file', 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'Editing', 'Sequence editing', 'Training material', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'geneseq', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Keyword', 'selex', 'selex sequence format', 'Proteins', 'Lipoproteins', 'Immunoproteins and antigens']"
33199862,"We developed Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype (TRIP) screening, and applied it to find new mediators of drug susceptibility in M. tuberculosis (MTB). The TRIP screen exploits a library of 207 Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains, representing 97% of annotated MTB regulators. Each TFI strain is engineered for conditional induction of a single MTB TF and expression of its associated regulon. We chemically-trigger induction of the pooled library grown in absence and presence of the first-line anti-TB drug isoniazid, and we quantify the proportion of each TFI strain in the pool by next-generation sequencing to identify regulatory adaptations that alter fitness under these conditions.","Transposon-based strategies provide a powerful and unbiased way to study the bacterial stress response<sup>1-8</sup>, but these approaches cannot fully capture the complexities of network-based behaviour. Here, we present a network-based genetic screening approach: the transcriptional regulator-induced phenotype (TRIP) screen, which we used to identify previously uncharacterized network adaptations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid (INH). We found regulators that alter INH susceptibility when induced, several of which could not be identified by standard gene disruption approaches. We then focused on a specific regulator, mce3R, which potentiated INH activity when induced. We compared mce3R-regulated genes with baseline INH transcriptional responses and implicated the gene ctpD (Rv1469) as a putative INH effector. Evaluating a ctpD disruption mutant demonstrated a previously unknown role for this gene in INH susceptibility. Integrating TRIP screening with network information can uncover sophisticated molecular response programs.","['Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Isoniazid/*pharmacology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Stress, Physiological/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']","['Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
28506317,"Gut microbiota play a key role in maintaining homeostasis in the human gut and alterations in the gut microbial ecosystem predispose to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and gut inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor can restore gut microbial diversity and pathogen colonization resistance and is being investigated for its ability to improve inflammatory gut conditions such as IBD. In this study, we investigated changes in gut microbiota following FMT in 38 patients with CDI with or without underlying IBD. Following FMT that successfully treated CDI, there was a significant change in gut microbial composition towards the donor microbiota and an overall increase in microbial diversity consistent with previous studies. FMT was successful in treating CDI using a diverse set of donors and varying degrees of donor stool engraftment suggesting donor type and degree of engraftment were not key for successful FMT treatment of CDI. However, in patients with underlying IBD, there was significantly lower expansion of new taxa and higher proportion of original community and more CDI relapses after FMT during a 24-month follow up. Moreover, the need for therapy for IBD did not change following FMT. These results suggest that changes in gut microbial landscape may be important for long term success of CDI treatment in patients with underlying IBD and potentially for improvement of underlying pathophysiology in IBD.

24939885,"Within the last decade, C. difficile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the leading cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization resistance against C. difficile, is a known risk factor in C. difficile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difficile remains difficult to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method for some patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Our results provide insight into the structural and potential metabolic changes that occur following FMT, which may aid in the development of new treatment methods for C. difficile infection.","Clostridium difficile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections, and up to 40% of patients suffer from recurrence of disease following standard antibiotic therapy. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difficile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capable of colonization resistance to C. difficile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural changes following this therapy. Further identification of the specific community members and functions that promote colonization resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difficile infection.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteria/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Biological Therapy', 'Clostridioides difficile/*physiology', 'Clostridium Infections/microbiology/*therapy', 'Feces/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Microbiota', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'STRIDE log file', 'Infectious disease', 'Protein interactions', 'Sequence', 'Sequence features', 'Gastroenterology', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction']"
31776276,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a human respiratory pathogen that causes yearly global epidemics, and sporadic pandemics due to human adaptation of pathogenic strains. Efficient replication of IAV in different species is, in part, dictated by its ability to exploit the genetic environment of the host cell. To investigate IAV tropism in human cells, we evaluated the replication of IAV strains in a diverse subset of epithelial cell lines. HeLa cells were refractory to growth of human H1N1 and H3N2, and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIs) viruses. Interestingly, a human isolate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 successfully propagated in HeLa cells to levels comparable to a human lung cell line. Heterokaryon cells generated by fusion of HeLa and permissive cells supported H1N1 growth, suggesting the absence of a host factor(s) required for replication of H1N1, but not H5N1, in HeLa cells. The absence of this factor(s) was mapped to reduced nuclear import, replication, and translation, and deficient viral budding. Using reassortant H1N1:H5N1 viruses, we found that the combined introduction of nucleoprotein (NP) and hemagglutinin (HA) from H5N1 was necessary and sufficient to enable H1N1 growth. Overall, this study suggests the absence of one or more cellular factors in HeLa cells that results in abortive replication of H1N1, H3N2, and LPAI viruses, but can be circumvented upon introduction of H5N1 NP and HA. Further understanding of the molecular basis of this restriction will provide important insights into virus-host interactions that underlie IAV pathogenesis and tropism.","Influenza A virus (IAV) is a human respiratory pathogen that causes yearly global epidemics, as well as sporadic pandemics due to human adaptation of pathogenic strains.

While human-to-human transmission is limited, there is a risk that these zoonotic viruses may acquire adaptive mutations enabling them to propagate efficiently and cause devastating human pandemics. Therefore, it is important to identify viral determinants that provide these viruses with a replicative advantage in human cells. Here, we tested the growth of influenza A virus in a subset of human cell lines and found that abortive replication of H1N1 viruses in HeLa cells can be circumvented upon the introduction of H5N1 virus HA and NP.

30146161,"How transcription affects genome organization in the nucleus is poorly understood. Analyzing influenza A virus (IAV)-infected human macrophages, we observe rapid reorganization of chromatin interactions. These changes occur where IAV NS1 protein-induced global inhibition of transcription termination leads to read-through transcription for hundreds of kilobases past the ends of highly transcribed genes. In these read-through regions, RNA polymerase II induces cohesin displacement from CTCF sites at loop anchors, leading to disrupted chromatin interactions and decompaction. Conversely, transcription elongation inhibition allows cohesin to accumulate at previously transcribed CTCF sites and to mediate chromatin looping and compaction. Data from non-viral stimuli indicates that transcription generally regulates cohesin and genome organization within gene bodies. Additionally, transcription into heterochromatin regions switches them from the inert (B) to the permissive (A) chromatin compartment and enables transcription factor binding. Our data indicate that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II remodels genome architecture in vivo.","How transcription affects genome 3D organization is not well understood.

28813680,Tn-seq and RNA-seq of three strains of S. pneumoniae during nutrient depletion.,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']","['Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Training material', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic code', 'Genetics', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model accession', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Ligand-receptor pair analysis localized these changes to the extracellular matrix, where hyaluronan was increased in aged animals and altered the proliferative response of bone marrow-derived macrophages to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

Our data indicate a potentially causal link among inborn errors in SETX, susceptibility to infection and the development of neurologic disorders.","['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases', 'Dogs', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Influenza, Human/*immunology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/metabolism', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Multifunctional Enzymes', 'Orthomyxoviridae/*physiology', 'RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias/congenital', 'Spinocerebellar Degenerations/*genetics', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication/genetics', 'West Nile Fever/*immunology', 'West Nile virus/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Helical net', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Enzymes', 'Function analysis', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'OrthoXML', 'RNA', 'rna', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecule data processing', 'Small molecules', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Virus annotation', 'Virus identifier', 'Exome sequencing']"
32559462,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a threat to mankind because it generates yearly epidemics and poorly predictable sporadic pandemics with catastrophic potential. Influenza has a small RNA genome (~14 Kb) composed of 8 mini-chromosomes (segments). Segments encode both structural proteins and proteins expressed only during infection. Segments are constituted by a 5’UTR followed by a coding region and a 3’UTR. Transcription of IAV RNA into mRNA depends on host RNA Polymerase II, as the viral polymerase cleaves 5’ capped cellular nascent transcripts to be used as primers to initiate mRNA synthesis. We hypothesized that host nascent transcripts bearing AUG could generate upstream ORFs in the viral segments, a phenomenon that would depend on the translatability of the viral 5’UTRs. Using orthogonal datasets we report the existence of this mechanism, which generate host-virus chimeric proteins. We show that most segments encode proteins in this manner, expanding the proteome diversity of IAV in infected cells. Host-virus chimeric proteins are conserved across IAV strains, pointing to an evolutionary conservation of function achieved by sampling of the evolutionary space before gene fixation. Thus, we discover a mechanism that generate human-virus chimeric proteins during infection.","RNA viruses are a major human health threat. The life cycles of many highly pathogenic RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and Lassa virus depends on host mRNA, because viral polymerases cleave 5'-m7G-capped host transcripts to prime viral mRNA synthesis (""cap-snatching""). We hypothesized that start codons within cap-snatched host transcripts could generate chimeric human-viral mRNAs with coding potential. We report the existence of this mechanism of gene origination, which we named ""start-snatching."" Depending on the reading frame, start-snatching allows the translation of host and viral ""untranslated regions"" (UTRs) to create N-terminally extended viral proteins or entirely novel polypeptides by genetic overprinting. We show that both types of chimeric proteins are made in IAV-infected cells, generate T cell responses, and contribute to virulence. Our results indicate that during infection with IAV, and likely a multitude of other human, animal and plant viruses, a host-dependent mechanism allows the genesis of hybrid genes.","[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'RNA Caps/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Virus Infections/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Viruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/genetics']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Translational medicine', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Rice', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Proteins', 'Chimera detection', 'protein', 'Threading', 'Protein threading', 'Open science', 'RNA', 'rna', 'LIPID MAPS ID', 'Infectious disease', 'RNA central ID', 'PCR experiment', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Protein domains', 'Duplication detection']"

Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we sought to compare microbial changes over time in patients with or without recurrence and to identify microbial signatures that may correlate to the development of recurrence. We observed a trend towards lower diversity in samples collected from patients with recurrent disease over time. Although microbial community structure was similar between samples from recurrent and nonrecurrent patients, we observed a significantly different community structure between samples that tested positive or negative for C. difficile. Interestingly, patients with more severe disease had a lower diversity compared to healthier patients.

Although the importance of the gut microbiota in C. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. Culture-independent high-density Roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with CDI, 36 subjects with C. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (CDN), and 40 healthy control subjects. A total of 526,071 partial 16S rRNA sequence reads of the V1 to V3 regions were aligned with 16S databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. Genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the CDI and CDN groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the Firmicutes phylum. Normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing C2 to C4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in the CDI and CDN groups. These data demonstrate associations between the depletion of Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including C. difficile infection.

Growth and tolerance data can be found in Supplementary Data 8 and Purine Metabolism data in Supplementary Data 9.,"Detailed knowledge on how bacteria evade antibiotics and eventually develop resistance could open avenues for novel therapeutics and diagnostics. It is thereby key to develop a comprehensive genome-wide understanding of how bacteria process antibiotic stress, and how modulation of the involved processes affects their ability to overcome said stress. Here we undertake a comprehensive genetic analysis of how the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae responds to 20 antibiotics. We build a genome-wide atlas of drug susceptibility determinants and generated a genetic interaction network that connects cellular processes and genes of unknown function, which we show can be used as therapeutic targets. Pathway analysis reveals a genome-wide atlas of cellular processes that can make a bacterium less susceptible, and often tolerant, in an antibiotic specific manner. Importantly, modulation of these processes confers fitness benefits during active infections under antibiotic selection. Moreover, screening of sequenced clinical isolates demonstrates that mutations in genes that decrease antibiotic sensitivity and increase tolerance readily evolve and are frequently associated with resistant strains, indicating such mutations could be harbingers for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.","['*Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Streptococcus pneumoniae']","['Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'Microbial ecology', 'Drug name', 'Drug report', 'Drug structure', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbiology']"

31601718,"Little is known about the relative importance of monocyte and tissue-resident macrophages in the development of lung fibrosis. We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.
","Ontologically distinct populations of macrophages differentially contribute to organ fibrosis through unknown mechanisms.We applied lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing and single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridisation to a spatially restricted model of asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis.We demonstrate that tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, tissue-resident peribronchial and perivascular interstitial macrophages, and monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are present in the fibrotic niche. Deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages but not tissue-resident alveolar macrophages ameliorated asbestos-induced lung fibrosis. Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages were specifically localised to fibrotic regions in the proximity of fibroblasts where they expressed molecules known to drive fibroblast proliferation, including platelet-derived growth factor subunit A. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics in both humans and mice, we identified macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) signalling as one of the novel druggable targets controlling self-maintenance and persistence of these pathogenic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages.

Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV-mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation.

Pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated when co-delivery of L. reuteri with glycerol was effective against C. difficile colonization in complex human fecal microbial communities, whereas treatment with either glycerol or L. reuteri alone was ineffective. Global unbiased microbiome and metabolomics analysis independently confirmed that glycerol precursor delivery with L. reuteri elicited changes in human microbial community composition and function that preferentially targets C. difficile outgrowth and toxicity, a finding consistent with glycerol fermentation and reuterin production. Antimicrobial resistance has thus been successfully exploited in the natural design of the human microbiome evasion of C. difficile and may provide a prototypic precursor-directed probiotic approach.

","Staphylococcus aureus infection is a rising public health care threat. S. aureus is believed to have elaborate regulatory networks that orchestrate its virulence. Despite its importance, the systematic understanding of the transcriptional landscape of S. aureus is limited. Here, we describe the primary transcriptome landscape of an epidemic USA300 isolate of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. We experimentally determined 1,861 transcription start sites with their principal promoter elements, including well-conserved -35 and -10 elements and weakly conserved -16 element and 5' untranslated regions containing AG-rich Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In addition, we identified 225 genes whose transcription was initiated from multiple transcription start sites, suggesting potential regulatory functions at transcription level.

27306663,"The DIABIMMUNE project aims to test the hygiene hypothesis and explore its role in the development of type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. Project researchers are seeking to validate the hypothesis and, in the process, uncover the biological mechanisms through which hygiene influences the immune system and potentially hampers the immune responses. This web site contains information about microbiome analyses conducted for DIABIMMUNE by researchers based at the Broad Institute. Previous studies have shown that a strong association exists between the prevalence of immune-mediated disease and improved standard of living and hygiene. The “hygiene hypothesis” is a widely supported theory that accounts for this observed association between the increase in diseases of the immune system and decreased exposure to pathogens. Initially, the hygiene hypothesis referred only to the increased incidence of allergy and asthma in developed countries, but in recent years it has been applied to the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) as well.The DIABIMMUNE project is looking at the microbiome in subjects from three separate countries – Russia, Finland, and Estonia – in order to explore this phenomenon. One of the starkest contrasts in standard of living worldwide is present at the border between Russian Karelia and Finland, where there is a sevenfold difference in the gross national product. Meanwhile, Estonia represents a country in rapid transition, having westernized since breaking away from the USSR over twenty years ago. These three populations comprise a “living laboratory,” offering a unique opportunity to test the hygiene hypothesis and gene-environmental interactions in the development of autoimmune disease. While there is little difference in the frequency of the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genotypes that predispose individuals to and protect them from T1D between these countries, the incidence of T1D is six times lower in Russian Karelia than in Finland. The aim of the DIABIMMUNE project is to assess the role of the hygiene hypothesis in the development of immune-mediated diseases – T1D in particular – and to define the mechanisms behind the potential protective effect conferred by microbial agents. A part of the study follows 76 children from all the three countries. In this application, funding for the travel expenses to collaborate in this study by conducting statistical and computational modeling for this data is applied.

Prospective cohort design with monthly sampling for the first ~3 years of life.","The gut microbial community is dynamic during the first 3 years of life, before stabilizing to an adult-like state. However, little is known about the impact of environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. We report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, about half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first 3 years of life. Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by cesarean section and about 20% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first 6 to 18 months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of high-density longitudinal sampling studies with high-resolution strain profiling for studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteroides/drug effects/genetics', 'Cesarean Section', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male']","['Selection detection', 'Reaction data', 'Reaction ID', 'Paediatrics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial collection', 'Abstract', 'Gastroenterology', 'Statistical calculation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'MAT']"

34163069,"Development of cancer is intimately associated with genetic abnormalities that target proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In human hematological malignancies, recurrent chromosomal translocation of nucleoporin (NUP98 or NUP214) generates an aberrant chimera that invariably retains nucleoporin’s IDR, tandemly dispersed phenylalanine-andglycine (FG) repeats1-3. However, it remains largely elusive how unstructured IDRs contribute to oncogenesis. We here show that IDR or FG repeats harbored within NUP98-HOXA9, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor (TF) chimera recurrently detected in acute leukemia patients1,4,5, is essential for establishing nuclear liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) puncta and for inducing leukemic transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, LLPS of NUP98-HOXA9 not only promotes chromatin occupancy of chimera TF oncoproteins but is also required for formation of a broad, ‘super-enhancer’-like binding pattern, typically seen at a battery of leukemia-related loci exemplified by HOX, MEIS and PBX genes, potentiating their transcriptional activation. An artificial HOX chimera, created by replacing NUP98’s FG repeats with an unrelated LLPSforming IDR of FUS6,7, had similar enhancement effects on chimera’s chromatin binding and target gene activation. Via Hi-C mapping, we further demonstrated that the phase-separated NUP98-HOXA9 protein assembly is able to induce formation of CTCF-independent chromatin looping enriched at leukemic oncogenes. Together, this report describes a proof-of-principle example wherein cancer acquires mutation to establish condensates of oncogenic TFs via a phase separation mechanism, which simultaneously enhances their chromatin targeting and induces organization of aberrant three-dimensional chromatin structure during tumorous transformation. As a range of LLPS-competent molecules are implicated in various human cancers, this mechanism can potentially be generalized to many malignant and diseased settings.","The development of cancer is intimately associated with genetic abnormalities that target proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

A micro-BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine the final protein concentration in the cell lysate. 200 µg of protein for each sample were reduced and alkylated as previously described1. Proteins were precipitated using methanol/chloroform. In brief, four volumes of methanol were added to the cell lysate, followed by one volume of chloroform, and finally three volumes of water. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to separate the chloroform phase from the aqueous phase. The precipitated protein was washed with three volumes of methanol, centrifuged and the resulting washed precipitated protein was allowed to air dry. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 4 M Urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, followed by dilution to 1 M urea with the addition of 200 mM EPPS, pH 8. Proteins were first digested with LysC (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 12 hours at room temperature. The LysC digestion was diluted to 0.5 M Urea with 200 mM EPPS pH 8 followed by digestion with trypsin (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 6 hours at 37 °C. Tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Anhydrous ACN was added to each peptide sample to a final concentration of 30% v/v, and labeling was induced with the addition of TMT reagent to each sample at a ratio of 1:4 peptide:TMT label. The 11 or 16-plex labeling reactions were performed for 1.5 hours at room temperature and the reaction quenched by the addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% for 15 minutes at room temperature. Each of the sample channels were combined in a 1:1 ratio, desalted using C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters) and analyzed by LC-MS for channel ratio comparison. Samples were then combined using the adjusted volumes determined in the channel ratio analysis and dried down in a speed vacuum. The combined sample was then resuspended in 1% formic acid and acidified (pH 2 - 3) before being subjected to desalting with C18 SPE (Sep-Pak, Waters). Samples were then offline fractionated into 96 fractions by high pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent LC1260) through an aeris peptide xb-c18 column (phenomenex) with mobile phase A containing 5% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O, and mobile phase B containing 90% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O (both pH 8.0). The 96 resulting fractions were then pooled in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions and these fractions were used for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.

The data were acquired using a mass range of m/z 340 – 1350, resolution 120,000, AGC target 5 x 105, maximum injection time 100 ms, dynamic exclusion of 120 seconds for the peptide measurements in the Orbitrap. Data dependent MS2 spectra were acquired in the ion trap with a normalized collision energy (NCE) set at 35%, AGC target set to 1.8 x 104 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. MS3 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a HCD collision energy set to 55%, AGC target set to 2 x 105, maximum injection time of 150 ms, resolution at 50,000 and with a maximum synchronous precursor selection (SPS) precursors set to 10.","Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecules that recruit a ubiquitin ligase to a target protein for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation.

Using chemo-proteomics, we not only map the degradability of the zinc-dependent HDAC family identifying leads for targeting HDACs 1-8 and 10 but also explore important aspects of degrading epigenetic enzymes. We discover cell line-driven target specificity and that HDAC degradation often results in collateral loss of HDAC-containing repressive complexes.

34793694,"Although Huntington’s disease (HD) is a late onset neurological condition, studies suggest a developmental contribution to its adult manifestations. Imaging studies in presymptomatic HD gene carriers revealed early alterations in white matter tract with a marked defect in the corpus callosum. This tract is mainly formed by axons projecting from layer II/III neurons. HD leads to microtubule bundling defects in the growth cone, the cellular compartment that drives axonal growth. We performed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of growth cones from WT (HdhQ7/Q7) and HD (HdhQ7/Q111) mice to identify proteins involved in HD-induced phenotypes on axonal growth and on the growth cone microtubule cytoskeleton.","Although the classic symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) manifest in adulthood, neural progenitor cell behavior is already abnormal by 13 weeks' gestation. To determine how these developmental defects evolve, we turned to cell and mouse models. We found that layer II/III neurons that normally connect the hemispheres are limited in their growth in HD by microtubule bundling defects within the axonal growth cone, so that fewer axons cross the corpus callosum. Proteomic analyses of the growth cones revealed that NUMA1 (nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein 1) is downregulated in HD by miR-124. Suppressing NUMA1 in wild-type cells recapitulates the microtubule and axonal growth defects of HD, whereas raising NUMA1 levels with antagomiR-124 or stabilizing microtubules with epothilone B restores microtubule organization and rescues axonal growth. NUMA1 therefore regulates the microtubule network in the growth cone, and HD, which is traditionally conceived as a disease of intracellular trafficking, also disturbs the cytoskeletal network.","['Animals', 'Axons/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Growth Cones/physiology', '*Huntington Disease/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Proteomics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Molecules', 'Microbiology', 'Microsatellites', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

There are 5 different DPRs poly(GA), poly(GR), poly(PR), poly(PA), poly(GP) which are neurotoxic in vitro. In our study, we identified the interactome of all five DPR proteins, consisting of 125 repeats, overexpressed in HEK293T cells using BioID2 proximity labeling. We identified 140 interacting partners for polyGR, 130 for polyGA, 138 for polyPR, 62 for polyPA, and 38 for polyGP. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of proteomic data identified interaction candidates involved in protein translation, signal transduction pathways, protein catabolic processes, amide metabolic processes, and RNA-binding. Through further analyses, we evaluated the interaction between polyGA and Valosin-containing protein (VCP) in HEK293T cells as well as in brains of C9orf72 patients. Furthermore, we are showing that polyGA sequester VCP in polyGA aggregates and hinders its function. Additionally, we analyzed the effect of decreased level of VCP on autophagic markers p62 and LC3.","Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, two devastating neurodegenerative disorders. One of the proposed mechanisms of GGGGCC repeat expansion is their translation into non-canonical dipeptide repeats, which can then accumulate as aggregates and contribute to these pathologies. There are five different dipeptide repeat proteins (polyGA, polyGR, polyPR, polyPA and polyGP), some of which are known to be neurotoxic. In the present study, we used BioID2 proximity labelling to identify the interactomes of all five dipeptide repeat proteins consisting of 125 repeats each. We identified 113 interacting partners for polyGR, 90 for polyGA, 106 for polyPR, 25 for polyPA and 27 for polyGP. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the proteomic data revealed that these target interaction partners are involved in a variety of functions, including protein translation, signal transduction pathways, protein catabolic processes, amide metabolic processes and RNA-binding. Using autopsy brain tissue from patients with C9orf72 expansion complemented with cell culture analysis, we evaluated the interactions between polyGA and valosin containing protein (VCP). Functional analysis of this interaction revealed sequestration of VCP with polyGA aggregates, altering levels of soluble valosin-containing protein. VCP also functions in autophagy processes, and consistent with this, we observed altered autophagy in cells expressing polyGA. We also observed altered co-localization of polyGA aggregates and p62 in cells depleted of VCP. All together, these data suggest that sequestration of VCP with polyGA aggregates contributes to the loss of VCP function, and consequently to alterations in autophagy processes in C9orf72 expansion disorders.","['*Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/pathology', 'C9orf72 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repeat Expansion/genetics', 'Dipeptides/genetics', '*Frontotemporal Dementia/pathology', 'Humans', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Valosin Containing Protein/genetics/metabolism']","['protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Repeat sequences', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Peptide property', 'Geotemporal metadata', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Protein contact map', 'Protein chain']"
34187905,"This experiment sought to characterize the perturbations to the telomere proteome brought about by modulation of SLX4IP expression, as we have previously found SLX4IP to act as a key regulator of telomere maintenance.","The maintenance of telomere length supports repetitive cell division and therefore plays a central role in cancer development and progression. Telomeres are extended by either the enzyme telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we found that the telomere-associated protein SLX4IP dictates telomere proteome composition by recruiting and activating the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 to the SLX4 complex. PIAS1 SUMOylated the telomere-binding protein RAP1, which disrupted its interaction with the telomere-binding protein TRF2 and facilitated its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In the cytosol, RAP1 bound to IκB kinase (IKK), resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and its induction of <i>Jagged-1</i> expression, which promoted Notch signaling and the institution of ALT. This axis could be targeted therapeutically in ALT-driven cancers and in tumor cells that develop resistance to antitelomerase therapies. Our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying SLX4IP-dependent telomere plasticity and demonstrate the role of telomere proteins in directly coordinating intracellular signaling and telomere maintenance dynamics.","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Signal Transduction', '*Sumoylation', '*Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Protein active sites', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'PCR experiment', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"
34350936,Analysis of secreted proteome from cells engineered with knockout of Mia3 gene isoforms encoding TANGO1L and TANGO1S,"Complex machinery is required to drive secretory cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is an essential process in eukaryotic cells. In vertebrates, the MIA3 gene encodes two major forms of transport and Golgi organization protein 1 (TANGO1S and TANGO1L), which have previously been implicated in selective trafficking of procollagen. Using genome engineering of human cells, light microscopy, secretion assays, genomics and proteomics, we show that disruption of the longer form, TANGO1L, results in relatively minor defects in secretory pathway organization and function, including having limited impacts on procollagen secretion. In contrast, loss of both long and short forms results in major defects in cell organization and secretion. These include a failure to maintain the localization of ERGIC53 (also known as LMAN1) and SURF4 to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and dramatic changes to the ultrastructure of the ER-Golgi interface. Disruption of TANGO1 causes significant changes in early secretory pathway gene and protein expression, and impairs secretion not only of large proteins, but of all types of secretory cargo, including small soluble proteins.

Among the main findings, MAR and PAR readers regulate various common and distinct processes, such as the DNA-damage response, cellular metabolism, RNA trafficking, and transcription. We monitored the dynamics of PAR interactions upon induction of oxidative DNA damage and uncovered the mechanistic connections between ubiquitin signaling and ADP-ribosylation.

(2018).","Proteomic analysis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM-associated proteins, collectively known as the matrisome, is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and insolubility of these proteins. Here we present sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH MS) as a tool for the quantitative analysis of matrisomal proteins in both non-enriched and ECM enriched tissue without the need for prior fractionation. Utilising a spectral library containing 201 matrisomal proteins, we compared the performance and reproducibility of SWATH MS over conventional data-dependent analysis mass spectrometry (DDA MS) in unfractionated murine lung and liver. SWATH MS conferred a 15-20% increase in reproducible peptide identification across replicate experiments in both tissue types and identified 54% more matrisomal proteins in the liver versus DDA MS. We further use SWATH MS to evaluate the quantitative changes in matrisome content that accompanies ECM enrichment. Our data shows that ECM enrichment led to a systematic increase in core matrisomal proteins but resulted in significant losses in matrisome-associated proteins including the cathepsins and proteins of the S100 family. Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates the utility of SWATH MS as a versatile tool for in-depth characterisation of the matrisome in unfractionated and non-enriched tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: The matrisome is a complex network of extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM-associated proteins that provides scaffolding function to tissues and plays important roles in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes. However, due to its inherent complexity and insolubility, proteomic studies of the matrisome typically require the application of enrichment workflows prior to MS analysis. Such enrichment strategies often lead to losses in soluble matrisome-associated components. In this study, we present sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH MS) as a tool for the quantitative analysis of matrisomal proteins. We show that SWATH MS provides a more reproducible coverage of the matrisome compared to data-dependent analysis (DDA) MS. We also demonstrate that SWATH MS is capable of accurate quantification of matrisomal proteins without prior ECM enrichment and fractionation, which may simplify sample handling workflows and avoid losses in matrisome-associated proteins commonly linked to ECM enrichment.","['Animals', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Compound name', 'Codon usage fraction calculation', 'Protein chemical modifications', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Statistical modelling', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Transition matrix', 'Proteins', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

Peptide sequences missing from the spliced version of CAPN10 expressed in COS7 cells were determined by MS analysis.,"Calpain-10 (CAPN10) belongs to the calpain superfamily. Genetic polymorphisms of the CAPN10 gene are associated with susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although the role of CAPN10 in the pathophysiology of diabetes has been extensively investigated, its biochemical properties are largely unknown. In this report, we made the surprising discovery that CAPN10 cDNA transcripts are subject to cryptic splicing and unexpected protein products were expressed. The same set of splicing products was reproducibly detected in four types of cultured cells including the primary culture of mouse myoblast. At least, one of the products was identical to a natural splicing variant. Sequence analysis of the splicing potential of CAPN10 cDNA, together with mutagenesis studies, resulted in the identification of a powerful splicing acceptor site at the junction of the sequences encoded by exons 9 and 10. We successfully extended the analysis to create expression construct resistant to splicing for both human and mouse CAPN10. The construct allowed us to analyze two major CAPN10 isoforms and reveal their difference in substrate proteolysis and potential cell functions. These results demonstrate that proteins produced from cDNA do not necessarily reflect the original nucleotide sequence.

Despite establishment of well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm-null cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed sudden acquisition of non-mesodermal identity in Brm-null cells, consistent with a new transition state referred to as a saddle-node bifurcation. Mechanistically, loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of cardiac enhancers while increasing expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing expression of neural suppressor REST, and disrupting composition of BRG1 complexes. Brm mutant identity switch was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modeling supports all our observations. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1 mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, unmasking an in vivo role for Brm. Our results reveal Brm as a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>.

Here, we have unveiled two non-canonical FDHs in Bacillus subtilis which are organized into two-subunit complexes, as shown by mass spectrometry, with unique features, ForCE1 and ForCE2. The ForC catalytic subunit interacts with an unprecedented partner subunit ForE and its amino acid sequence within the active site deviates from the consensus residues typically associated to FDH activity, with an histidine residue naturally substituted by a glutamine.

18203677,DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in neural stem cells,"Chromatin architecture in stem cells determines the pattern of gene expression and thereby cell identity and fate. The chromatin-modifying agents trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AzaC) affect histone acetylation and DNA methylation, respectively, and thereby influence chromatin structure and gene expression. In our previous work, we demonstrated that TSA/AzaC treatment of neurosphere cells induces hematopoietic activity in vivo that is long-term, multilineage, and transplantable. Here, we have analyzed the TSA/AzaC-induced changes in gene expression by global gene expression profiling. TSA/AzaC caused both up- and downregulation of genes, without increasing the total number of expressed genes. Chromosome analysis showed no hot spot of TSA/AzaC impact on a particular chromosome or chromosomal region. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed common gene expression patterns among neurosphere cells treated with TSA/AzaC, embryonic stem (ES) cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, our analysis identified several stem cell genes and pluripotency-associated genes that are induced by TSA/AzaC in neurosphere cells, including Cd34, Cd133, Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Bex1, and the Dppa family members Dppa2, 3, 4, and 5. Sox2 and c-Myc are constitutively expressed in neurosphere cells. We propose a model in which TSA/AzaC, by removal of epigenetic inhibition, induces the reactivation of several stem cell and pluripotency-associated genes, and their coordinate expression enlarges the differentiation potential of somatic precursor cells.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Prosencephalon/cytology/drug effects/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Transcription', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Electroencephalography']"

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing, whole-organ explant, and live-cell imaging, we show that homeostatic TM epidermis is distinct from other epidermal sites and has discrete proliferative zones with a three-dimensional hierarchy of multiple keratinocyte populations. TM stem cells reside in a discrete location of the superior TM and generate long-lived clones and committed progenitors (CPs). CP clones exhibit lateral migration, and their proliferative capacity is supported by Pdgfra+ fibroblasts, generating migratory but non-proliferative progeny. Single-cell sequencing of the human TM revealed similar cell types and transcriptional programming. Thus, during homeostasis, TM keratinocytes transit through a proliferative CP state and exhibit directional lateral migration. This work forms a foundation for understanding TM disorders and modeling keratinocyte biology.","['Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis', 'Humans', '*Keratinocytes', 'Stem Cells', '*Tympanic Membrane']","['cel', 'Epistasis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Transmembrane protein prediction']"
30964207,MicroRNA-223 ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cancer by targeting multiple inflammatory and oncogenic genes in hepatocytes,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to more severe forms of liver injury including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In humans, only 20%-40% of patients with fatty liver progress to NASH, and mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) develop fatty liver but are resistant to NASH development. To understand how simple steatosis progresses to NASH, we examined hepatic expression of anti-inflammatory microRNA-223 (miR-223) and found that this miRNA was highly elevated in hepatocytes in HFD-fed mice and in human NASH samples. Genetic deletion of miR-223 induced a full spectrum of NAFLD in long-term HFD-fed mice including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that, compared to wild-type mice, HFD-fed miR-223 knockout (miR-223KO) mice had greater hepatic expression of many inflammatory genes and cancer-related genes, including (C-X-C motif) chemokine 10 (Cxcl10) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz), two well-known factors that promote NASH development. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Cxcl10 and Taz are two downstream targets of miR-223 and that overexpression of miR-223 reduced their expression in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatic levels of miR-223, CXCL10, and TAZ mRNA were elevated in human NASH samples, which positively correlated with hepatic levels of several miR-223 targeted genes as well as several proinflammatory, cancer-related, and fibrogenic genes. Conclusion: HFD-fed miR-223KO mice develop a full spectrum of NAFLD, representing a clinically relevant mouse NAFLD model; miR-223 plays a key role in controlling steatosis-to-NASH progression by inhibiting hepatic Cxcl10 and Taz expression and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.","['Acyltransferases', 'Animals', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*pathology', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Random Allocation', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']","['Keyword', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Plasmid identifier', 'MAT', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Metabolic disease', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'geneseq', 'Random sequence generation', 'Sequence mutation and randomisation', 'EMBL feature location', 'Citation', 'Data reference', 'Reference identification', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Sequence position specification', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Regulatory RNA']"
11717454,The pattern of gene expression in human CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells,"We have analyzed the pattern of gene expression in human primary CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. We identified 42,399 unique serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tags among 106,021 SAGE tags collected from 2.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells purified from bone marrow. Of these unique SAGE tags, 21,546 matched known expressed sequences, including 3,687 known genes, and 20,854 were novel without a match. The SAGE tags that matched known sequences tended to be at higher levels, whereas the novel SAGE tags tended to be at lower levels. By using the generation of longer sequences from SAGE tags for gene identification (GLGI) method, we identified the correct gene for 385 of 440 high-copy SAGE tags that matched multiple genes and we generated 198 novel 3' expressed sequence tags from 138 high-copy novel SAGE tags. We observed that many different SAGE tags were derived from the same genes, reflecting the high heterogeneity of the 3' untranslated region in the expressed genes. We compared the quantitative relationship for genes known to be important in hematopoiesis. The qualitative identification and quantitative measure for each known gene, expressed sequence tag, and novel SAGE tag provide a base for studying normal gene expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and for studying abnormal gene expression in hematopoietic diseases.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", '*Antigens, CD34', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Research Design']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Translational medicine', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Sequence', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence map', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genetic map', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Design', 'Database search', 'Laboratory animal science']"

Our analysis suggests that the transcriptome of the bronchial epithelium is distinct from that of lung parenchyma and other tissue types. Moreover, our analysis has identified novel bronchial-enriched genes such as MS4A8B, and has demonstrated the use of SAGE for the discovery of novel transcript variants. Significantly, gene expression associated with ciliogenesis is evident in bronchial epithelium, and includes the expression of transcripts specifying axonemal proteins DNAI2, SPAG6, ASP, and FOXJ1 transcription factor. Moreover, expression of potential regulators of ciliogenesis such as MDAC1, NYD-SP29, ARMC3, and ARMC4 were also identified.

Although several new ncRNAs in yeast were recently discovered by individual studies, to our knowledge no comprehensive empirical search has been conducted. We demonstrate a powerful and versatile method for global identification of previously undescribed ncRNAs by modulating an essential RNA processing pathway through the depletion of a key ribonucleoprotein enzyme component, and monitoring differential transcriptional activities with genome tiling arrays during the time course of the ribonucleoprotein depletion. The entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome was scanned during cell growth decay regulated by promoter-mediated depletion of Rpp1, an essential and functionally conserved protein component of the RNase P enzyme. In addition to most verified genes and ncRNAs, expression was detected in 98 antisense and intergenic regions, 74 that were further confirmed to contain previously undescribed RNAs. A class of ncRNAs, located antisense to coding regions of verified protein-coding genes, is discussed in this article.

16382445,Taxane-selected ovarian cancer cell lines,"Taxanes are important drugs in the treatment of ovarian and other cancers, but their efficacy is limited by intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene, is one of the causes of clinical drug resistance to taxanes. To study the mechanisms of MDR1 activation related to taxanes, we established 11 multidrug-resistant variants from six ovarian cancer cell lines by continuous exposure to either paclitaxel or docetaxel. We profiled gene expression and gene copy number alterations in these cell lines using cDNA microarrays and identified a cluster of genes coactivated with MDR1 in 7q21.11-13. Regional activation was evident in nine resistant variants displaying a coexpression pattern of up to 22 genes over an 8-Mb area, including SRI, MGC4175, CLDN12, CROT, and CDK6. In six of these variants, regional activation was driven by gene copy number alterations, with low-level gains or high-level amplifications spanning the involved region. However, three variants displayed regional increases in gene expression even without concomitant gene copy number changes. These results suggest that regional gene activation may be a fundamental mechanism for acquired drug resistance, with or without changes in gene dosage. In addition to numerical and structural chromosomal changes driven by genome instability in cancer cells, other mechanisms might be involved in MDR1 regional activation, such as chromatin remodeling and DNA or histone modifications of the 7q21 region.","['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Paclitaxel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Amplification detection', 'Gene classification', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene ID', 'Codon usage table generation', 'Codon usage', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'DNA transcription']"
16167763,Transcriptome changes of Arabidopsis during pathogen and insect attack,"Plant defenses against pathogens and insects are regulated differentially by cross-communicating signaling pathways in which salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) play key roles. To understand how plants integrate pathogen- and insect-induced signals into specific defense responses, we monitored the dynamics of SA, JA, and ET signaling in Arabidopsis after attack by a set of microbial pathogens and herbivorous insects with different modes of attack. Arabidopsis plants were exposed to a pathogenic leaf bacterium (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato), a pathogenic leaf fungus (Alternaria brassicicola), tissue-chewing caterpillars (Pieris rapae), cell-content-feeding thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), or phloem-feeding aphids (Myzus persicae). Monitoring the signal signature in each plant-attacker combination showed that the kinetics of SA, JA, and ET production varies greatly in both quantity and timing. Analysis of global gene expression profiles demonstrated that the signal signature characteristic of each Arabidopsis-attacker combination is orchestrated into a surprisingly complex set of transcriptional alterations in which, in all cases, stress-related genes are overrepresented. Comparison of the transcript profiles revealed that consistent changes induced by pathogens and insects with very different modes of attack can show considerable overlap. Of all consistent changes induced by A. brassicicola, Pieris rapae, and E occidentalis, more than 50% also were induced consistently by P. syringae. Notably, although these four attackers all stimulated JA biosynthesis, the majority of the changes in JA-responsive gene expression were attacker specific. All together, our study shows that SA, JA, and ET play a primary role in the orchestration of the plant's defense response, but other regulatory mechanisms, such as pathway cross-talk or additional attacker-induced signals, eventually shape the highly complex attacker-specific defense response.","['Alternaria/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis/*genetics/microbiology/parasitology/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclopentanes/metabolism', 'DNA, Plant/genetics', 'Ethylenes/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genetic Markers', 'Insecta/pathogenicity', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxylipins', 'Plant Diseases/*genetics/microbiology/parasitology', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Pseudomonas syringae/pathogenicity', 'Salicylic Acid/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Variant filtering', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Plant biology', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Biomarkers', 'Genetic map', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteins', 'Lipoproteins', 'PHYLIP format', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Genetic engineering', 'Protein modification ID', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
18381269,Comparative transcriptome analysis of early interaction events in Scots pine root tissues following challenge,"To investigate functional differences in the recognition and response mechanisms of conifer roots to fungi with different trophic strategies, Pinus sylvestris L. was challenged with a saprotrophic fungus Trichoderma aureoviride Rifai. The results were compared with separate studies investigating pine interactions with a pathogen, Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. sensu stricto and an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, Laccaria bicolor Maire (Orton). Global changes in the expression of 2109 conifer genes were assayed 1, 5 and 15 days after inoculation. Gene expression data from a cDNA microarray were analyzed by the 2-interconnected mixed linear model statistical approach. The total number of genes differentially expressed compared with the uninfected control was similar after challenge with the pathogen and the ectomycorrhizal symbiont, but the number of differentially expressed genes increased over time for H. annosum, and decreased for L. bicolor. Inoculation of pine roots with T. aureoviride resulted overall in a much lower number of genes with changed transcript levels compared with inoculation with H. annosum or L. bicolor. Functional classification of the differentially expressed genes revealed that the ectomycorrhizal fungus triggered transient induction of defence-related genes. The response and induction of defence against the pathogen was delayed and the magnitude increased over time. Thus, there were specific transcriptional responses depending on whether the conifer roots were challenged with mutualistic, saprotrophic or pathogenic fungi. This suggests that pine trees are able to recognize diverse fungal species and specifically distinguish whether they are pathogenic, neutral or beneficial microbial agents.","['Basidiomycota/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Communication', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Pinus sylvestris/*genetics/*microbiology/physiology', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plant Roots/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Ribosomal Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Seedlings/*microbiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Trichoderma/*pathogenicity/ultrastructure']","['Infectious disease', 'Cell line report', 'DNA barcoding', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'medline', 'PubMed XML', 'Medline UI', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

This unintended (""off-target"") silencing can hinder the use of RNAi to define gene function. Here we describe position-specific, sequence-independent chemical modifications that reduced silencing of partially complementary transcripts by all siRNAs tested. Silencing of perfectly matched targets was unaffected by these modifications. The chemical modification also reduced off-target phenotypes in growth inhibition studies. Key to the modification was 2'-O-methyl ribosyl substitution at position 2 in the guide strand, which reduced silencing of most off-target transcripts with complementarity to the seed region of the siRNA guide strand.

17283056,SR proteins in Drosophila,"Deciphering the role of alternative splicing in developmental processes relies on the identification of key genes whose expression is controlled by splicing regulators throughout the growth of a whole organism. Modulating the expression levels of five SR proteins in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster revealed that these splicing factors induce various phenotypic alterations in eye organogenesis and also affect viability. Although the SR proteins dASF/SF2 and B52 caused defects in ommatidia structure, only B52 impaired normal axonal projections of photoreceptors and neurogenesis in visual ganglia. Microarray analyses revealed that many transcripts involved in brain organogenesis have altered splicing profiles upon both loss and gain of B52 function. Conversely, a large proportion of transcripts regulated by dASF/SF2 are involved in eye development. These differential and specific effects of SR proteins indicate that they function to confer accuracy to developmental gene expression programs by facilitating the cell lineage decisions that underline the generation of tissue identities.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Brain/growth & development/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/*growth & development', 'Eye/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Developmental', 'Genes, Insect', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Larva/cytology', 'Male', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Medicines research and development', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'geneseq', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'MAT', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins', 'Invertebrates', 'Vertebrates', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

The majority of deregulated genes are cell proliferation specific and Rb-E2F dependent, causing ME cell proliferation and gland hyperplasia but not breast cancer formation. In the breast tumor cells a further 207 genes are differentially expressed, most of them belonging to the cell communication category. In tissue culture breast tumor cells frequently switch off WAP-SVT/t transgene expression and regain the morphology and growth characteristics of normal ME cells, although the tumor-revertant cells are aneuploid and only 114 genes regain the expression level of normal ME cells.

16618801,Genome-wide mapping of Polycomb target genes unravels their roles in cell fate transitions,"The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form chromatin-modifying complexes that are essential for embryonic development and stem cell renewal and are commonly deregulated in cancer. Here, we identify their target genes using genome-wide location analysis in human embryonic fibroblasts. We find that Polycomb-Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), PRC2, and tri-methylated histone H3K27 co-occupy >1000 silenced genes with a strong functional bias for embryonic development and cell fate decisions. We functionally identify 40 genes derepressed in human embryonic fibroblasts depleted of the PRC2 components (EZH2, EED, SUZ12) and the PRC1 component, BMI-1. Interestingly, several markers of osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chrondrogenesis are among these genes, consistent with the mesenchymal origin of fibroblasts. Using a neuronal model of differentiation, we delineate two different mechanisms for regulating PcG target genes. For genes activated during differentiation, PcGs are displaced. However, for genes repressed during differentiation, we paradoxically find that they are already bound by the PcGs in nondifferentiated cells despite being actively transcribed. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that PcGs are part of a preprogrammed memory system established during embryogenesis marking certain key genes for repressive signals during subsequent developmental and differentiation processes.","['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Gene family report', 'Exonic splicing enhancer prediction', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Protein domains', 'MRI', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Promoter ID', 'Genetic map', 'Promoter prediction', 'Protein data', 'Protein report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
17934521,Chromosome 1 tile path analysis of astrocytomas,"Astrocytic, oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas are the commonest gliomas in adults. They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P=0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However, the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87% of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of glioma cell lines. Akt3 amplifications were found in four glioblastomas.

17519359,Acute molecular responses to lengthening vs shortening muscle contractions,"Resistance training using lengthening (eccentric) contractions induces greater increases in muscle size than shortening (concentric) contractions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. Using temporal expression profiling, we compared changes in gene expression within 24 h of an acute bout of each type of contractions conducted simultaneously in the quadriceps of different legs. Five healthy young men performed shortening contractions with one leg while the contralateral leg performed lengthening contractions. Biopsies were taken from both legs before exercise and 3, 6, and 24 h afterwards, in the fed state. Expression profiling (n = 3) was performed using a custom-made Affymetrix MuscleChip containing probe sets of approximately 3,300 known genes and expressed sequence tags expressed in skeletal muscle. We identified 51 transcripts differentially regulated between the two exercise modes. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified four distinct clusters, three of which corresponded to unique functional categories (protein synthesis, stress response/early growth, and sarcolemmal structure). Using quantitative RT-PCR (n = 5), we verified expression changes (lengthening/shortening) in SIX1 (3 h, -1.9-fold, P < 0.001), CSRP3 (6 h, 2.9-fold, P < 0.05), and MUSTN1 (24 h, 4.3-fold, P < 0.05). We examined whether FBXO32/atrogin-1/MAFbx, a known regulator of protein breakdown and of muscle atrophy was differentially expressed: the gene was downregulated after lengthening contractions (3 h, 2.7-fold, P < 0.05; 6 h, 3.3-fold, P < 0.05; 24 h, 2.3-fold, P < 0.05). The results suggested that lengthening and shortening contractions activated distinct molecular pathways as early as 3 h postexercise. The molecular differences might contribute to mechanisms underlying the physiological adaptations seen with training using the two modes of exercise.","['Adult', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Exercise', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', '*Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Muscles/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Time Factors']","['Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Concentration', 'Relation extraction', 'Information extraction', 'Proteins', 'protein', ""Ensembl ID ('Mus musculus')"", 'SMILES', 'Molecules', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Protein databases', 'Protein modelling', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"
18045843,Identification and characterization of the changed transcripts in cumulus cells of Bmp15-/- and Bmp15-/-Gdf9+/--DM mice.,"Oocyte-derived bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) are key regulators of follicular development. Here we show that these factors control cumulus cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis and cholesterol biosynthesis before the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone. Transcripts encoding enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis were downregulated in both Bmp15(-/-) and Bmp15(-/-) Gdf9(+/-) double mutant cumulus cells, and in wild-type cumulus cells after removal of oocytes from cumulus-cell-oocyte complexes. Similarly, cholesterol synthesized de novo was reduced in these cumulus cells. This indicates that oocytes regulate cumulus cell cholesterol biosynthesis by promoting the expression of relevant transcripts. Furthermore, in wild-type mice, Mvk, Pmvk, Fdps, Sqle, Cyp51, Sc4mol and Ebp, which encode enzymes required for cholesterol synthesis, were highly expressed in cumulus cells compared with oocytes; and oocytes, in the absence of the surrounding cumulus cells, synthesized barely detectable levels of cholesterol. Furthermore, coincident with reduced cholesterol synthesis in double mutant cumulus cells, lower levels were also detected in cumulus-cell-enclosed double mutant oocytes compared with wild-type oocytes. Levels of cholesterol synthesis in double mutant cumulus cells and oocytes were partially restored by co-culturing with wild-type oocytes. Together, these results indicate that mouse oocytes are deficient in synthesizing cholesterol and require cumulus cells to provide products of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, oocyte-derived paracrine factors, particularly, BMP15 and GDF9, promote cholesterol biosynthesis in cumulus cells, probably as compensation for oocyte deficiencies in cholesterol production.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15', 'Cholesterol/*biosynthesis', 'Cumulus Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 9', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'cel', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Enteritidis). Understanding the evolution and diversity within and among outbreak strains is the first step towards this goal. To this end, we collected 106 new S. Enteriditis isolates within S. Enteriditis Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern JEGX01.0004 and close relatives, and determined their genome sequences. Sources for these isolates spanned food, clinical and environmental farm sources collected during the 2010 S. Enteritidis shell egg outbreak in the United States along with closely related serovars, S. Dublin, S. Gallinarum biovar Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. Despite the highly homogeneous structure of this population, S. Enteritidis isolates examined in this study revealed thousands of SNP differences and numerous variable genes (n = 366). Twenty-one of these genes from the lineages leading to outbreak-associated samples had nonsynonymous (causing amino acid changes) changes and five genes are putatively involved in known Salmonella virulence pathways. While chromosome synteny and genome organization appeared to be stable among these isolates, genome size differences were observed due to variation in the presence or absence of several phages and plasmids, including phage RE-2010, phage P125109, plasmid pSEEE3072_19 (similar to pSENV), plasmid pOU1114 and two newly observed mobile plasmid elements pSEEE1729_15 and pSEEE0956_35. These differences produced modifications to the assembled bases for these draft genomes in the size range of approximately 4.6 to 4.8 mbp, with S. Dublin being larger (∼4.9 mbp) and S. Gallinarum smaller (4.55 mbp) when compared to S. Enteritidis. Finally, we identified variable S.

Epistasis experiments with <i>Tdg</i>-deficient mESCs show no involvement of epigenetic DNA demethylation. Instead, <i>Neil</i>-deficiency results in oxidative damage specific to mitochondrial DNA, which triggers a TP53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis.

18314479,Immature dendritic cells under hypoxic condition,"Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in inflammatory tissues. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells whose differentiation, migration, and activities are intrinsically linked to the microenvironment. DCs will home and migrate through pathologic tissues before reaching their final destination in the lymph node. We studied the differentiation of human monocytes into immature DCs (iDCs) in a hypoxic microenvironment. We generated iDC in vitro under normoxic (iDCs) or hypoxic (Hi-DCs) conditions and examined the hypoxia-responsive element in the promoter, gene expression, and biochemical KEGG pathways. Hi-DCs had an interesting phenotype represented by up-regulation of genes associated with cell movement/migration. In addition, the Hi-DC cytokine/receptor pathway showed a dichotomy between down-regulated chemokines and up-regulated chemokine receptor mRNA expression. We showed that CCR3, CX3CR1, and CCR2 are hypoxia-inducible genes and that CCL18, CCL23, CCL26, CCL24, and CCL14 are inhibited by hypoxia. A strong chemotactic response to CCR2 and CXCR4 agonists distinguished Hi-DCs from iDCs at a functional level. The hypoxic microenvironment promotes the differentiation of Hi-DCs, which differs from iDCs for gene expression profile and function. The most prominent characteristic of Hi-DCs is the expression of a mobility/migratory rather than inflammatory phenotype. We speculate that Hi-DCs have the tendency to leave the hypoxic tissue and follow the chemokine gradient toward normoxic areas where they can mature and contribute to the inflammatory process.","['Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokines/*genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

After reduction and alkylation, proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin and peptide mixtures were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using LTQ velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Raw data files were converted to MGF with Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.2; Thermo Fischer Scientific, San Jose, USA). Precursor mass range of 350-5000 Da and signal to noise ratio of 1.5 were the criteria used for generation of peak lists. In order to identify the proteins, the peptide and fragment masses obtained were matched automatically against the chordata section of a locally maintained copy of nr NCBI (19922528 sequences, download 08/21/2012). MS/MS ion searches were performed using MASCOT Daemon and search engine (version 2.3; Matrix Science, London, UK). The parameters used for database searches include trypsin as a protease with allowed two missed cleavage, carbamidomethylcysteine (+57 Da), oxidation of methionine (+16) and N-terminal protein acetylation (+42) as variable modifications. The tolerance of the ions was set to 5 ppm for parent and 0.8 Da for fragment ion matches","Understanding of the avian male gamete biology is essential to improve the conservation of genetic resources and performance in farming. In this study, the chicken semen peptidome/proteome and the molecular phenotype related to sperm quality were investigated. Spermatozoa (SPZ) and corresponding seminal plasma (SP) from 11 males with different fertilizing capacity were analyzed using three quantitative strategies (fluid and intact cells MALDI-MS, SDS-PAGE combined to LC-MS/MS with spectral counting and XIC methods). Individual MALDI profiling in combination with top-down MS allowed to characterize specific profiles per male and to identify 16 biomolecules (e.g.VMO1, AvBD10 and AvBD9 including polymorphism). Qualitative analysis identified 1165 proteins mainly involved in oxidoreduction mechanisms, energy processes, proteolysis and protein localization. Comparative analyses between the most and the least fertile males were performed. The enzymes involved in energy metabolism, respiratory chain or oxido-reduction activity were over-represented in SPZ of the most fertile males. The SP of the most and the least fertile males differed also on many proteins (e.g. ACE, AvBD10 and AvBD9, NEL precursor, acrosin).

To help address this, we have developed the PG Nexus pipeline. The PG Nexus allows users to covisualize peptides in the context of genomes or genomic contigs, along with RNA-seq reads. This is done in the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV). A Results Analyzer reports the precise base position where LC-MS/MS-derived peptides cover genes or gene isoforms, on the chromosomes or contigs where this occurs. In prokaryotes, the PG Nexus pipeline facilitates the validation of genes, where annotation or gene prediction is available, or the discovery of genes using a ""virtual protein""-based unbiased approach. We illustrate this with a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis of two strains of Campylobacter concisus . For higher eukaryotes, the PG Nexus facilitates gene validation and supports the identification of mRNA splice junction boundaries and splice variants that are protein-coding. This is illustrated with an analysis of splice junctions covered by human phosphopeptides, and other examples of relevance to the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project. The PG Nexus is open-source and available from https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/ap11_Samifier.

SWAN-1 genome sequencing,"Two mesophilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, designated strains SWAN1T and AL-21, were isolated from two contrasting peatlands: a near circumneutral temperate minerotrophic fen in New York State, USA, and an acidic boreal poor fen site in Alaska, USA, respectively. Cells of the two strains were rod-shaped, non-motile, stained Gram-negative and resisted lysis with 0.1% SDS. Cell size was 0.6×1.5-2.8 µm for strain SWAN1T and 0.45-0.85×1.5-35 µm for strain AL-21. The strains used H2/CO2 but not formate or other substrates for methanogenesis, grew optimally around 32-37 °C, and their growth spanned through a slightly low to neutral pH range (4.7-7.1). Strain AL-21 grew optimally closer to neutrality at pH 6.2, whereas strain SWAN1T showed a lower optimal pH at 5.4-5.7. The two strains were sensitive to NaCl with a maximal tolerance at 160 mM for strain SWAN1T and 50 mM for strain AL-21. Na2S was toxic at very low concentrations (0.01-0.8 mM), resulting in growth inhibition above these values. The DNA G+C content of the genomes was 35.7 mol% for strain SWAN1T and 35.8 mol% for strain AL-21. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains are members of the genus Methanobacterium. Strain SWAN1T shared 94-97% similarity with the type strains of recognized species of the genus Methanobacterium, whereas strain AL-21 shared 99% similarity with Methanobacterium lacus 17A1T.

24436469,"We isolated the extracellular matrix from human podocytes and endothelial cells in monoculture and coculture and analysed the matrix proteins by mass-spectrometry. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) compartment within the glomerulus and is known to contain tissue-restricted isoforms of collagen IV and laminin. It is integral to the capillary wall and therefore functionally linked to glomerular filtration. While the composition of the GBM has been investigated with global and candidate-based approaches, the relative contributions of glomerular cell types to the production of ECM is not well understood. To enable the characterization of specific cellular contributions to the GBM, we analyzed ECM isolated from podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells in vitro using mass spectrometrybased proteomics. These analyses identified cell typespecific differences in ECM composition, indicating distinct contributions to glomerular ECM assembly. Coculture of podocytes and endothelial cells resulted in an altered composition and organization of ECM compared to monoculture ECMs from single cell types, suggesting a role for cell-cell crosstalk in the production of glomerular ECM. This was supported by the identification of basement membranelike ECM deposition between cocultured cells using electron microscopy. Importantly, compared to monoculture, the coculture ECM proteome better resembled a tissue-derived glomerular ECM dataset, indicating its relevance to GBM in vivo. Protein network analyses revealed a common core of 35 highly connected structural ECM proteins that may be important for glomerular ECM assembly. Overall, these findings demonstrate the complexity of the glomerular ECM and suggest that both ECM composition and organization are context dependent.

Mutations in phoP lead to compromised production of pathogen-specific cell wall components and attenuation both ex vivo and in vivo. The PhoP regulon comprises several transcriptional regulators as well as genes for polyketide synthases and PE/PPE proteins. The most prominent site of PhoP regulation was located in the intergenic region between rv2395 and PE_PGRS41, where the mcr7 gene codes for a small non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Our prediction suggested that Mcr7 might regulate tatC at the post-transcriptional level by occlusion of the RBS and the consequent translational arrest. Consequently, we studied the secretome from exponentially grown cultures of strain H37Rv, its phoP mutant and a phoP complemented mutant by in-depth proteomics. The results are consistent with a regulatory model involving PhoP, Mcr7 and tatC mRNA since the absence of Mcr7 in the phoP mutant would result in more efficient TatC translation and therefore increased secretion.","The PhoPR two-component system is essential for virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis where it controls expression of approximately 2% of the genes, including those for the ESX-1 secretion apparatus, a major virulence determinant.

Using antibodies against the native protein in ChIP-seq experiments (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) we demonstrated that PhoP binds to at least 35 loci on the M. tuberculosis genome. The PhoP regulon comprises several transcriptional regulators as well as genes for polyketide synthases and PE/PPE proteins. Integration of ChIP-seq results with high-resolution transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) revealed that PhoP controls 30 genes directly, whilst regulatory cascades are responsible for signal amplification and downstream effects through proteins like EspR, which controls Esx1 function, via regulation of the espACD operon. The most prominent site of PhoP regulation was located in the intergenic region between rv2395 and PE_PGRS41, where the mcr7 gene codes for a small non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Northern blot experiments confirmed the absence of Mcr7 in an M. tuberculosis phoP mutant as well as low-level expression of the ncRNA in M. tuberculosis complex members other than M. tuberculosis. By means of genetic and proteomic analyses we demonstrated that Mcr7 modulates translation of the tatC mRNA thereby impacting the activity of the Twin Arginine Translocation (Tat) protein secretion apparatus. As a result, secretion of the immunodominant Ag85 complex and the beta-lactamase BlaC is affected, among others.

32747755,Role of iron in the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein linked to various biological processes reliant on epigenetic plasticity, which include development, inflammation, immune responses, wound healing and cancer progression. Although it is often referred to as a cell surface marker, the functional regulatory roles of CD44 remain elusive. Here we report the discovery that CD44 mediates the endocytosis of iron-bound hyaluronates in tumorigenic cell lines, primary cancer cells and tumours. This glycan-mediated iron endocytosis mechanism is enhanced during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, in which iron operates as a metal catalyst to demethylate repressive histone marks that govern the expression of mesenchymal genes. CD44 itself is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear iron through a positive feedback loop, which is in contrast to the negative regulation of the transferrin receptor by excess iron. Finally, we show that epigenetic plasticity can be altered by interfering with iron homeostasis using small molecules. This study reveals an alternative iron-uptake mechanism that prevails in the mesenchymal state of cells, which illuminates a central role of iron as a rate-limiting regulator of epigenetic plasticity.","['*Endocytosis', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*metabolism', 'Iron/*metabolism']","['Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid report']"

These include pathogens and rhizospheric strains as well as organisms with exceptional broad substrate ranges. Nevertheless, when it comes to physiological adaptation due to cell density and growth, on transcript- or proteome level, our knowledge is rather limited. The few existing studies so far focused mainly on B. subtilis and E. coli. In this study Pseudomonas putida F1, a model for the degradation of aromatic compounds, and its adaptation to stationary growth was investigated by label-free proteome quantification. The data unveiled that entrance to the stationary phase does not involve an abrupt switch within the P. putida F1 proteome, but is rather an ongoing adaptation which starts during exponential growth which is illustrated by principle component and functional enrichment analysis. These changes were especially metabolic adaptations, which involved a clear increase in amino acid degradation capabilities and a loss of transcription as well as translation capacity. The final entrance to the stationary phase was accompanied by increased oxidative stress protection, although the stress and stationary sigma factor RpoS increased in abundance already during mid-exponential growth. Finally, the data supports previous observations that phenylacetic acid concentrations might play an important role in growth and pathogenicity regulation within Pseudomonades.","The physiological adaptation to stationary growth by Pseudomonas putida F1, a model organism for the degradation of aromatic compounds, was investigated by proteome-wide label-free quantification.The data unveiled that entrance to the stationary phase did not involve an abrupt switch within the P. putida F1 proteome, but rather an ongoing adaptation that started already during the mid-exponential growth phase.

A total of 129 proteins were identified as potential YBX1 binding partners. The interaction between the complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP), and YBX1 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Knockdown of C1QBP enhanced the phosphorylation of YBX1and its nuclear translocation, indicating that C1QBP negatively regulated YBX1 activation. The clinical significance of these two proteins was analyzed in the tissues from 52 RCC patients by immunohistochemistry. Expression of YBX1 was markedly elevated in the carcinoma tissues, and its nuclear expression was associated with histological T stage and metastasis. Meanwhile, the level of C1QBP in the carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in the adjacent healthy tissues, which was negatively correlated with the nuclear localization of YBX1 in the RCC tissues (P = 0.011). These data suggest that C1QBP is a novel regulator of YBX1, and the expression of C1QBP and the nuclear expression of YBX1 could both be used as independent prognostic makers for cancer progression in the RCC patients.

25492093,A novel Reverse-Polynomial Dilution (RPD) calibration method was compared to SID for accuracy relative error and precision in a ~0-250ng/mL range in phospholipid-depleted and non-depleted human plasma.,"Matrix effect is the alteration of an analyte's concentration-signal response caused by co-existing ion components. With electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix effects are believed to be a function of the relative concentrations, ionization efficiency, and solvation energies of the analytes within the electrospray ionization droplet. For biological matrices such as plasma, the interactions between droplet components is immensely complex and the effect on analyte signal response not well elucidated. This study comprised of three sequential quantitative analyses: we investigated whether there is a generalizable correlation between the range of unique ions in a sample matrix (complexity); the amount of matrix components (concentration); and matrix effect, by comparing an E. coli digest matrix (∼2600 protein proteome) with phospholipid depleted human blood plasma, and unfractionated, nondepleted human plasma matrices (∼10(7) proteome) for six human plasma peptide multiple reaction monitoring assays. Our data set demonstrated analyte-specific interactions with matrix complexity and concentration properties resulting in significant ion suppression for all peptides (p < 0.01), with nonuniform effects on the ion signals of the analytes and their stable-isotope analogs. These matrix effects were then assessed for translation into relative residual error and precision effects in a low concentration (∼0-250 ng/ml) range across no-matrix, complex matrix, and highly complex matrix, when a standard addition stable isotope dilution calibration method was used. Relative residual error (%) and precision (CV%) by stable isotope dilution were within <20%; however, error in phospholipid-depleted and nondepleted plasma matrices were significantly higher compared with no-matrix (p = 0.006). Finally a novel reverse-polynomial dilution calibration method with and without phospholipid-depletion was compared with stable isotope dilution for relative residual error and precision. Reverse-polynomial dilution techniques extend the Lower Limit of Quantification and reduce error (p = 0.005) in low-concentration plasma peptide assays and is broadly applicable for verification phase Tier 2 multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring assay development within the FDA-National Cancer Institute (NCI) biomarker development pipeline.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calibration', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Indicator Dilution Techniques', 'Isotope Labeling', '*Limit of Detection', '*Models, Statistical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*blood/chemistry', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Mass spectra calibration', 'Calculation', 'Generation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Stable isotope dimethyl labelling', 'Isotope-coded protein label', '18O labeling', 'Selection detection', 'Format detection', 'Deletion detection', 'Statistical modelling', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipids', 'Lipid report']"

Daphnia, the waterflea, is a textbook example for predator induced phenotypic plastic defences including changes in life-history, behaviour and morphology. However, the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying these inducible defences is still in its early stages. We exposed Daphnia magna to chemical cues of the predator Triops cancriformis to identify key processes underlying plastic defensive trait formation. D. magna is known to develop an array of morphological changes in the presence of T. cancriformis including changes of carapace morphology and cuticle hardening. To get a more comprehensive idea of this phenomenon, we studied four different genotypes originating from habitats with different predation history, reaching from predator-free to temporary habitats containing T. cancriformis. We analysed the morphologies as well as proteomes of predator-exposed and control animals. Three genotypes showed morphological changes when the predator was present. Using a high-throughput proteomics approach, we found 294 proteins which were significantly altered in their abundance after predator exposure in a general or genotype dependant manner. Proteins connected to genotype dependant responses were related to the cuticle, protein synthesis and calcium binding whereas the yolk protein vitellogenin increased in abundance in all genotypes, indicating their involvement in a more general response. Furthermore, genotype dependant responses at the proteome level correlated well with local adaptation to Triops predation.

28194435,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) have been shown to adopt a catabolic metabolic programme with increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation fuelled oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The role of Foxp3 in this metabolic shift is poorly understood. Here we show that Foxp3 was sufficient to induce a significant increase in the spare respiratory capacity of the cell, the extra OXPHOS capacity available to a cell to meet increased demands on energy in response to work. Foxp3-expressing cells were enhanced in their ability to utilise palmitate for respiration and, in addition, the activity of electron transport complexes I, II and IV were enhanced following Foxp3 expression. Foxp3 also imparts a selective advantage in ATP generation capacity, one that might be exploited as a source of adenosine for functional immunomodulation. In order to explore possible mechanisms for these differences in metabolism we conducted a quantitative proteomics study to compare the contribution of TGFβ and the transcription factor Foxp3 to the Treg proteome. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to examine differences between proteomes of nuclear and cytoplasmic Foxp3-containing CD4+ T cells from various sources with Foxp3- activated CD4 T cells, as well as Treg from human peripheral blood. Gene set enrichment analysis of our proteomic datasets demonstrated that Foxp3 expression is associated with a significant up regulation of several members of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Not only does Foxp3 influence genes directly concerned with immune function, but also with the energy generating functions of Treg.","Tregs can adopt a catabolic metabolic program with increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation-fueled oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). It is unclear why this form of metabolism is favored in Tregs and, more specifically, whether this program represents an adaptation to the environment and developmental cues or is ""hardwired"" by Foxp3. Here we show, using metabolic analysis and an unbiased mass spectroscopy-based proteomics approach, that Foxp3 is both necessary and sufficient to program Treg-increased respiratory capacity and Tregs' increased ability to utilize fatty acids to fuel oxidative phosphorylation. Foxp3 drives upregulation of components of all the electron transport complexes, increasing their activity and ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation.

Ninety-five TCGA tumor samples were used in this study.","Extensive genomic characterization of human cancers presents the problem of inference from genomic abnormalities to cancer phenotypes. To address this problem, we analysed proteomes of colon and rectal tumours characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and perform integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. Messenger RNA transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumours. Proteomics identified five proteomic subtypes in the TCGA cohort, two of which overlapped with the TCGA 'microsatellite instability/CpG island methylation phenotype' transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation and protein expression patterns associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cis- and trans-effects on mRNA abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus, proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both mRNA and protein levels; proteomics data highlighted potential 20q candidates, including HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), TOMM34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase).

Some of these physiological benefits appear to be mediated via the secretion of peptide/protein hormones into the blood stream. The plasma peptidome contains the entire complement of low molecular weight endogenous peptides derived from secretion, protease activity and PTMs, and is a rich source of hormones. In the current study we have quantified the effects of intense exercise on the plasma peptidome to identify novel exercise regulated secretory factors in humans. We developed an optimized 2D-LC-MS/MS method and used multiple fragmentation methods including HCD and EThcD to analyze endogenous peptides. This resulted in quantification of 5,548 unique peptides during a time course of exercise and recovery. The plasma peptidome underwent dynamic and large changes during exercise on a time-scale of minutes with many rapidly reversible following exercise cessation. Among acutely regulated peptides, many were known hormones including insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, bradykinin, cholecystokinin and secretogranins validating the method. Prediction of bioactive peptides regulated with exercise identified <i>C</i>-terminal peptides from Transgelins, which were increased in plasma during exercise. <i>In vitro</i> experiments using synthetic peptides identified a role for transgelin peptides on the regulation of cell-cycle, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration. We investigated the effects of exercise on the regulation of PTMs and proteolytic processing by building a site-specific network of protease/substrate activity. Collectively, our deep peptidomic analysis of plasma revealed that exercise rapidly modulates the circulation of hundreds of bioactive peptides through a network of proteases and PTMs. These findings illustrate that peptidomics is an ideal method for quantifying changes in circulating factors on a global scale in response to physiological perturbations such as exercise.

We then mapped the DNA binding of these factors by ChIP-seq, as well as their functionality by gain- and loss-of-function experiments, by transcriptomics and proteomics. This identified new DNA binding proteins and novel regulators with moonlighting properties like proteases and metabolic enzymes and allowed to reconstruct the gene regulatory network.","Here, we determined the relative importance of different transcriptional mechanisms in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae, by employing an array of experimental techniques under multiple genetic and environmental perturbations.

We identified nine transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, representing 43% of the genome, and 16 regulators that indirectly affect transcription. Only 20% of transcriptional regulation is mediated by canonical TFs when responding to perturbations. Using a Random Forest, we quantified the non-redundant contribution of different mechanisms such as supercoiling, metabolic control, RNA degradation, and chromosome topology to transcriptional changes.

At cohesin-enriched centromeres, cohesin activity causes the accumulation of DNA damage, RF rotation, and pre-catenation, confirming that cohesin-dependent DNA topological stress impacts on normal replication progression. In contrast, at the rDNA, cohesin and condensin activity inhibit the repair of damage caused by DNA topological stress. We propose that, as well as generally acting to ensure faithful genetic inheritance, SMCs can disrupt genome stability by trapping DNA topological stress.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Fungal', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']","['Phosphorylation sites', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Image', 'EMAGE ID', '2D PAGE image', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Duplication detection', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Fungi', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Protein accession']"
32194870,Single-cell RNA-seq of the testis sample of ICR mice treated with busulfan and/or alginate oligosaccharides,"<b>Rationale</b>: Busulfan is currently an indispensable anti-cancer drug, particularly for children, but the side effects on male reproduction are so serious that critical drug management is needed to minimize any negative impact. Meanwhile, alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) are natural products with many consequent advantages, that have attracted a great deal of pharmaceutical attention. In the current investigation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on murine testes treated with busulfan and/or AOS to define the mitigating effects of AOS on spermatogenesis at the single cell level. <b>Methods</b>: Testicular cells (<i>in vivo</i>) were examined by single cell RNA sequencing analysis, histopathological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting. Testes samples (<i>ex vivo</i>) underwent RNA sequencing analysis. Blood and testicular metabolomes were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). <b>Results</b>: We found that AOS increased murine sperm concentration and motility, and rescued busulfan disrupted spermatogenesis through improving (i) the proportion of germ cells, (ii) gene expression important for spermatogenesis, and (iii) transcriptional factors <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, AOS promoted the <i>ex vivo</i> expression of genes important for spermatogenesis<i>.</i> Finally, our results showed that AOS improved blood and testis metabolomes as well as the gut microbiota to support the recovery of spermatogenesis. <b>Conclusions</b>: AOS could be used to improve fertility in patients undergoing chemotherapy and to combat other factors that induce infertility in humans.","['Alginates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blood/drug effects', 'Busulfan/*toxicity', 'Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects', 'Infertility, Male/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Metabolome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Oligosaccharides/pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA-Seq', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Sperm Motility/drug effects', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Testis/*drug effects', 'Transcriptome']","['Sequence coordinates', 'Pain medicine', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'BLC', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Clinical trial report', 'Drug report', 'Microbiology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Data handling', 'MAT', 'Metabolomics', 'Metabolites', 'Metabolic disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Protein flexibility or motion report', 'Keyword', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
29925953,By analyzing of the changes in proteome mediated by the oncogene BRAFV600E in melanoma cells we provide new insights on the pathways upregulated in these cells and possible new targets for therapy.,"Reprogramming of mRNA translation has a key role in cancer development and drug resistance <sup>1</sup> . However, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in this process remain poorly understood. Wobble tRNA modifications are required for specific codon decoding during translation<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we show, in humans, that the enzymes that catalyse modifications of wobble uridine 34 (U<sub>34</sub>) tRNA (U<sub>34</sub> enzymes) are key players of the protein synthesis rewiring that is induced by the transformation driven by the BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> oncogene and by resistance to targeted therapy in melanoma. We show that BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> -expressing melanoma cells are dependent on U<sub>34</sub> enzymes for survival, and that concurrent inhibition of MAPK signalling and ELP3 or CTU1 and/or CTU2 synergizes to kill melanoma cells. Activation of the PI3K signalling pathway, one of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to MAPK therapeutic agents, markedly increases the expression of U<sub>34</sub> enzymes. Mechanistically, U<sub>34</sub> enzymes promote glycolysis in melanoma cells through the direct, codon-dependent, regulation of the translation of HIF1A mRNA and the maintenance of high levels of HIF1α protein. Therefore, the acquired resistance to anti-BRAF therapy is associated with high levels of U<sub>34</sub> enzymes and HIF1α. Together, these results demonstrate that U<sub>34</sub> enzymes promote the survival and resistance to therapy of melanoma cells by regulating specific mRNA translation.","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Codon/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Uridine/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Vemurafenib/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Zebrafish/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Codon name', 'Codon number', 'Codon usage', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'ELAND format', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA translation', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'URI', 'URI format', '.nib', 'Fish']"

To quantify protein levels in the human retina and identify patterns of differentially-expressed proteins, we collected foveal, macular, and peripheral retina punch biopsies from healthy donor eyes and analyzed protein content by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).","The human retina is composed of the sensory neuroretina and the underlying retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), which is firmly complexed to the vascular choroid layer. Different regions of the retina are anatomically and molecularly distinct, facilitating unique functions and demonstrating differential susceptibility to disease. Proteomic analysis of each of these regions and layers can provide vital insights into the molecular process of many diseases, including Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and glaucoma. However, separation of retinal regions and layers is essential before quantitative proteomic analysis can be accomplished. Here, we describe a method for dissection and collection of the foveal, macular, and peripheral retinal regions and underlying RPE-choroid complex, involving regional punch biopsies and manual removal of tissue layers from a human eye.One-dimensional SDS-PAGE as well as downstream proteomic analysis, such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), can be used to identify proteins in each dissected retinal layer, revealing molecular biomarkers for retinal disease.","['Choroid/metabolism/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Retina/metabolism/*surgery', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/*metabolism']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

All translation machinery components require multiple maturation events to be functional. These include post-transcriptional and post-translational modification steps and methylations are the most frequent among these events. In eukaryotes, Trm112, a small protein (COG2835) conserved in all three domains of life, interacts and activates four methyltransferases (Bud23, Trm9, Trm11 and Mtq2) that target different components of the translation machinery (rRNA, tRNAs, release factors).

Interestingly, among the identified enzymes, some are functionally orthologous to eukaryotic Trm112 partners, emphasizing again the similarity between eukaryotic and archaeal translation machineries.

Adipose mesenchymal stromal cells, haematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes are among those cell types that are especially responsive. On the pathway level, young blood invokes new gene sets in addition to reversing established ageing patterns, with the global rescue of genes encoding electron transport chain subunits pinpointing a prominent role of mitochondrial function in parabiosis-mediated rejuvenation.

31527256,Identification of C2CD4A as a human diabetes susceptibility gene with a role in β-cell insulin secretion [RNA-Seq],"Fine mapping and validation of genes causing β cell failure from susceptibility loci identified in type 2 diabetes genome-wide association studies (GWAS) poses a significant challenge. The <i>VPS13C-C2CD4A-C2CD4B</i> locus on chromosome 15 confers diabetes susceptibility in every ethnic group studied to date. However, the causative gene is unknown. FoxO1 is involved in the pathogenesis of β cell dysfunction, but its link to human diabetes GWAS has not been explored. Here we generated a genome-wide map of FoxO1 superenhancers in chemically identified β cells using 2-photon live-cell imaging to monitor FoxO1 localization. When parsed against human superenhancers and GWAS-derived diabetes susceptibility alleles, this map revealed a conserved superenhancer in <i>C2CD4A</i>, a gene encoding a β cell/stomach-enriched nuclear protein of unknown function. Genetic ablation of C2cd4a in β cells of mice phenocopied the metabolic abnormalities of human carriers of <i>C2CD4A</i>-linked polymorphisms, resulting in impaired insulin secretion during glucose tolerance tests as well as hyperglycemic clamps. C2CD4A regulates glycolytic genes, and notably represses key β cell ""disallowed"" genes, such as <i>lactate dehydrogenase A</i> We propose that <i>C2CD4A</i> is a transcriptional coregulator of the glycolytic pathway whose dysfunction accounts for the diabetes susceptibility associated with the chromosome 15 GWAS locus.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/metabolism', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*biosynthesis', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Conserved transcription regulatory sequence identification', 'Protein conserved site signature', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Cell type accession', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleotide identifier', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

It is well-established that tumorigenesis, especially in glioblastoma (GBM), is attributed to hyperactive RTK/Ras/ERK signaling. While CIC is mutated in other tumors, here we show that CIC has a tumor suppressive function in GBM through an alternative mechanism. We find that CIC protein levels are negligible in GBM due to continuous proteasome-mediated degradation, which is mediated by the E3 ligase PJA1 and show that this occurs through binding of CIC to its DNA target and phosphorylation on residue S173. PJA1 knockdown increased CIC stability and extended survival using in-vivo models of GBM. Deletion of the ERK binding site resulted in stabilization of CIC and increased therapeutic efficacy of ERK inhibition in GBM models.

The virulence phenotype was not linked to the acquisition of genetic variations and was sustained for several generations, despite cultivation of the ex vivo virulence-adapted P. aeruginosa cells under rich medium conditions in vitro. Transcriptional reprogramming seemed to be induced by a host-specific food source, as reprogramming was also observed upon cultivation of P. aeruginosa in rich medium supplemented with polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The establishment of induced memory responses adds a time dimension and seems to fill the gap between long-term evolutionary genotypic adaptation and short-term induced individual responses.

In endometrial cancer, <i>ESR1</i> mutations are associated with worse outcomes and less obesity, however, experimental investigation of these mutations has not been performed. Using a unique CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, we introduced the D538G mutation, a common endometrial cancer mutation that alters the ligand binding domain of ESR1, while epitope tagging the endogenous locus. We discovered estrogen-independent mutant ESR1 genomic binding that is significantly altered from wild-type ESR1. The D538G mutation impacted expression, including a large set of nonestrogen-regulated genes, and chromatin accessibility, with most affected loci bound by mutant ESR1.

A functional clustered dendrogram generated using the Euclidean distance showed that the DEGs identified only in acute in vivo NVUs were clustered in cellular proliferation gene ontology functions. The DEGs only identified in chronic in vivo NVUs were clustered in inflammation and immune response, permeability, and adhesion functions. In addition, 1225 DEGs were only identified in the in vivo NVUs but not in vitro BMECs, and these clustered within neuronal and glial functions. One miRNA mmu-miR-3472a was differentially expressed (FC = - 5.98; p = 0.07, FDR corrected) in the serum of Ccm3/Pdcd10<sup>+/-</sup> when compared to wild type mice, and this was functionally related as a putative target to Cand2 (cullin associated and neddylation dissociated 2), a DEG in acute and chronic lesional NVUs and in vitro BMECs. Our results suggest that the acute model is characterized by cell proliferation, while the chronic model showed inflammatory, adhesion and permeability processes.

Similarly, TRPS1 expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results demonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells.","['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Human/growth & development', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
31323027,Profiling microRNA expression in murine bone healing and nonunion formation: Role of miR-140 during the early stage of bone healing,"Although cellular and molecular mechanisms during the course of bone healing have been thoroughly investigated, the regulation of gene expression by microRNA during bone regeneration is still poorly understood. We hypothesized that nonunion formation is associated with different microRNA expression patterns and that target proteins of these microRNAs are differently expressed in callus tissue of nonunions compared to physiologically healing bones. In a well-established femoral osteotomy model in CD-1 mice osteotomies were induced which result either in healing or in nonunion formation. MicroRNA and target protein expression was evaluated by microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-PCR) and Western blot. Microarray analyses demonstrated 44 microRNAs to be relevant for nonunion formation compared to physiological bone healing. In nonunions qrt-PCR could validate a higher expression of microRNA-140-3p and microRNA-140-5p. This was associated with a reduced expression of Dnpep and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α, which are both known to be target proteins of microRNA-140 and also to be involved in the process of bone healing. These data suggest that an increased expression of microRNA-140-3p and microRNA-140-5p markedly contributes to the development of nonunions, most probably by affecting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 function during the early stage of healing due to a reduced SDF-1α expression.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2/biosynthesis', '*Bone Regeneration', 'Chemokine CXCL12/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Femur/*injuries/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', ""Ensembl ID ('Otolemur garnettii')"", 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Here we introduce a cancer modeling paradigm using genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that captures authentic cancer pathobiology. Orthotopic engraftment of the neural progenitor cells derived from hiPSCs that have been genome-edited to contain tumor-associated genetic driver mutations revealed by The Cancer Genome Atlas project for glioblastoma (GBM) results in formation of high-grade gliomas. Similar to patient-derived GBM, these models harbor inter-tumor heterogeneity resembling different GBM molecular subtypes, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and extrachromosomal DNA amplification. Re-engraftment of these primary tumor neurospheres generates secondary tumors with features characteristic of patient samples and present mutation-dependent patterns of tumor evolution. These cancer avatar models provide a platform for comprehensive longitudinal assessment of human tumor development as governed by molecular subtype mutations and lineage-restricted differentiation.","['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Genome', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Glioma/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetic engineering', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Bioengineering', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Heterogen annotation', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Protein data']"

In order to identify targets of miRNAs, we sequenced two degradome sequencing profiles from leaves and roots of YK-10, respectively. By analyzing the small RNA-Seq profiles, we newly identified 137 conserved miRNAs and 23 species specific miRNAs in the genome of YK-10, which significantly improved the annotation of miRNAs in tea plant. Approximately 2000 differently expressed genes were identified when comparing RNA-Seq profiles of any two of the three organs selected in the study. Totally, more than 5000 targets of conserved miRNAs were identified in the two degradome profiles. Furthermore, our results suggest that a few miRNAs play roles in the biosynthesis pathways of theanine, caffeine and flavonoid. These results enhance our understanding of small RNA guided gene regulations in different organs of tea plant.","['Camellia sinensis/classification/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Components, Aerial/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Secondary Metabolism/genetics']","['Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Plant biology', 'HET group name', 'Gene component prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Drug metabolism', 'Secondary structure', 'Secondary structure alignment metadata']"
32014463,Teratosphaeria destructans Genome sequencing and assembly,"Teratosphaeria destructans is an aggressive fungal pathogen causing leaf and shoot blight on young Eucalyptus trees in plantations. The disease occurs across tropical and subtropical regions of South East Asia and has recently been found in South Africa. Asexual structures of the pathogen are produced on infected tissues, but sexual structures have never been observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the reproductive biology of T. destructans by characterising its mating type (MAT1) locus and investigating its potential for sexual recombination. We found that T. destructans has a heterothallic mating system, with either the MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-10 genes (MAT1-1 idiomorph) or the MAT1-2-1 and MAT1-2-12 genes (MAT1-2 idiomorph) present in a single individual. With a multiplex PCR assay, it was possible to distinguish the two MAT idiomorphs in several Teratosphaeria species and this approach was applied to six global populations of T. destructans. Although both mating types occurred in the South East Asian populations, a single mating type dominated each population. Isolates from the recent disease outbreak in South Africa comprised only a single mating type. Attempts to induce a sexual cycle in vitro using strains of opposite mating type were not successful. The uneven distribution of mating types in populations of T. destructans and the presence of only an asexual state on infected tissues suggests the absence of or at least a minor role for sexual reproduction where the pathogen occurs on non-native Eucalyptus in plantations.","['Ascomycota/*genetics', 'Asia, Southeastern', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Eucalyptus/microbiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genes, Mating Type, Fungal/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Reproduction/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']","['Mascot .dat file', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Reproductive health', 'Protein report', 'Natural product identification', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
32877217,Single cell transcriptional atlas of mouse Achilles tendons,"Tendon is a dense connective tissue that stores and transmits forces between muscles and bones. Cellular heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the biological basis of tissue homeostasis and disease, yet little is known about the diversity of cell types that populate tendon. To address this, we determined the heterogeneity of cell populations within mouse Achilles tendons using single-cell RNA sequencing. In assembling a transcriptomic atlas of Achilles tendons, we identified 11 distinct types of cells, including three previously undescribed populations of tendon fibroblasts. Prior studies have indicated that pericytes, which are found in the vasculature of tendons, could serve as a potential source of progenitor cells for adult tendon fibroblasts. Using trajectory inference analysis, we provide additional support for the notion that pericytes are likely to be at least one of the progenitor cell populations for the fibroblasts that compose adult tendons. We also modeled cell-cell interactions and identified previously undescribed ligand-receptor signaling interactions involved in tendon homeostasis. Our novel and interactive tendon atlas highlights previously underappreciated heterogeneity between and within tendon cell populations. The atlas also serves as a resource to further the understanding of tendon extracellular matrix assembly and maintenance and in the design of therapies for tendinopathies.","['Achilles Tendon/cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/genetics', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/genetics/metabolism', 'Collagen/genetics/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Pericytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell line report', 'GEN', 'Data acquisition', 'Collapsing methods', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Transition matrix', 'Proteins', 'Protein distance matrix', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'Biological system modelling', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

It has previously been shown that the nanoscale spatial distribution of ligands modulates EphA2 receptor reorganization, activation and the invasive properties of cancer cells. However, intracellular signaling downstream of EphA2 receptor activation by nanoscale spatially distributed ligands has not been elucidated. Here, we used DNA origami nanostructures to control the positions of ephrin-A5 ligands at the nanoscale and investigated EphA2 activation and transcriptional responses following ligand binding. Using RNA-seq, we determined the transcriptional profiles of human glioblastoma cells treated with DNA nanocalipers presenting a single ephrin-A5 dimer or two dimers spaced 14, 40 or 100 nm apart. These cells displayed divergent transcriptional responses to the differing ephrin-A5 nano-organization. Specifically, ephrin-A5 dimers spaced 40 or 100 nm apart showed the highest levels of differential expressed genes compared to treatment with nanocalipers that do not present ephrin-A5. These findings show that the nanoscale organization of ephrin-A5 modulates transcriptional responses to EphA2 activation.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Ephrin-A5/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', '*Nanostructures', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Receptor, EphA2/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Structure', 'Protein structure', 'Structure ID', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

DHA production in Aurantiochytrium sp T66 was studied with the aim to provide more knowledge about factors that affect the DHA-productivities and the contributions of the two enzyme systems used for fatty acid synthesis in thraustochytrids, fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and PUFA-synthase. Fermentations with nitrogen starvation, which is well-known to initiate lipid accumulation in oleaginous organisms, were compared to fermentations with nitrogen in excess, obtained by oxygen limitation. The specific productivities of fatty acids originating from FAS were considerably higher under nitrogen starvation than with nitrogen in excess, while the specific productivities of DHA were the same at both conditions. Global transcriptome analysis showed significant up-regulation of FAS under N-deficient conditions, while the PUFA-synthase genes were only marginally upregulated. Neither of them was upregulated under O<sub>2</sub>-limitation where nitrogen was in excess, suggesting that N-starvation mainly affects the FAS and may be less important for the PUFA-synthase. The transcriptome analysis also revealed responses likely to be related to the generation of reducing power (NADPH) for fatty acid synthesis.","['Docosahexaenoic Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Fatty Acid Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'NADP/biosynthesis', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Stramenopiles/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['Nucleic acids', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Documentation and help', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Kinetic model', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'SMILES string', 'Strain name', 'Regulatory RNA']"

Damage induces a reactive glial phenotype known as ""gliosis"", but the molecular identity of the inducing mechanism and triggers of ""enteric gliosis"" are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that surgical trauma during intestinal surgery triggers ATP release that drives enteric gliosis and inflammation leading to impaired motility in postoperative ileus (POI). ATP activation of a p38-dependent MAPK pathway triggers cytokine release and a gliosis phenotype in murine (and human) EGCs. Receptor antagonism and genetic depletion studies revealed P2X2 as the relevant ATP receptor and pharmacological screenings identified ambroxol as a novel P2X2 antagonist. Ambroxol prevented ATP-induced enteric gliosis, inflammation, and protected against dysmotility, while abrogating enteric gliosis in human intestine exposed to surgical trauma. We identified a novel pathogenic P2X2-dependent pathway of ATP-induced enteric gliosis, inflammation and dysmotility in humans and mice. Interventions that block enteric glial P2X2 receptors during trauma may represent a novel therapy in treating POI and immune-driven intestinal motility disorders.","['Animals', 'Cytokines', '*Gliosis', 'Inflammation', 'Intestine, Small/physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Neuroglia', 'Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists/*pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'RNA-Seq', 'Gene set testing', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID']"

To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq coverage on genes of interest, thereby increasing the sensitivity and scale of genetic screens by orders of magnitude. TAP-seq permits routine analysis of thousands of CRISPR-mediated perturbations within a single experiment, detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases sequencing requirements by up to 50-fold. We apply TAP-seq to generate perturbation-based enhancer-target gene maps for 1,778 enhancers within 2.5% of the human genome. We thereby show that enhancer-target association is jointly determined by three-dimensional contact frequency and epigenetic states, allowing accurate prediction of enhancer targets throughout the genome.

Fine mapping of the causal variant(s) at a locus depends on assays that are able to discriminate the effects of polymorphisms or mutations on gene expression. Here, we evaluated a moderate-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis approach, based on replicated measurement of transcript abundance in single-cell clones, by deleting candidate regulatory SNPs, affecting four genes known to be affected by large-effect expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) in leukocytes, and using Fluidigm qRT-PCR to monitor gene expression in HL60 pro-myeloid human cells. We concluded that there were multiple constraints that rendered the approach generally infeasible for fine mapping. These included the non-targetability of many regulatory SNPs, clonal variability of single-cell derivatives, and expense. Power calculations based on the measured variance attributable to major sources of experimental error indicated that typical eQTL explaining 10% of the variation in expression of a gene would usually require at least eight biological replicates of each clone.

31704733,LSD1 mediates AKT activity in PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer [RNA-Seq],"Activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is a critical mechanism for initiating cancer progression and migration. Colorectal cancers contain many genetic and epigenetic alterations that can contribute to EMT. Mutations activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are observed in >40% of patients with colorectal cancer contributing to increased invasion and metastasis. Little is known about how oncogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT synergize with chromatin modifiers to activate the EMT program. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and enhances cell migration. In this study, we determine that LSD1 expression is significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer with mutation of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, <i>PIK3CA</i>, compared with patients with colorectal cancer with WT <i>PIK3CA</i>. LSD1 enhances activation of the AKT kinase in colorectal cancer cells through a noncatalytic mechanism, acting as a scaffolding protein for the transcription-repressing CoREST complex. In addition, growth of <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant colorectal cancer cells is uniquely dependent on LSD1. Knockdown or CRISPR knockout of LSD1 blocks AKT-mediated stabilization of the EMT-promoting transcription factor Snail and effectively blocks AKT-mediated EMT and migration. Overall, we uniquely demonstrate that LSD1 mediates AKT activation in response to growth factors and oxidative stress, and LSD1-regulated AKT activity promotes EMT-like characteristics in a subset of <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that inhibitors targeting the CoREST complex may be clinically effective in patients with colorectal cancer harboring <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Kinase name', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Color', 'Transition matrix', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'cel', 'CellML', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Selection detection', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription']"
30975452,Gene expression data from UMUC-14 following FGFR3 knock-down using FGFR3 siRNAs,"FGFR3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in bladder cancer and a driver of an oncogenic dependency. Here we report that only the most common recurrent FGFR3 mutation, S249C (TCC→TGC), represents an APOBEC-type motif and is probably caused by the APOBEC-mediated mutagenic process, accounting for its over-representation. We observed significant enrichment of the APOBEC mutational signature and overexpression of AID/APOBEC gene family members in bladder tumors with S249C compared to tumors with other recurrent FGFR3 mutations. Analysis of replication fork directionality suggests that the coding strand of FGFR3 is predominantly replicated as a lagging strand template that could favor the formation of hairpin structures, facilitating mutagenic activity of APOBEC enzymes. In vitro APOBEC deamination assays confirmed S249 as an APOBEC target. We also found that the FGFR3 S249C mutation was common in three other cancer types with an APOBEC mutational signature, but rare in urothelial tumors without APOBEC mutagenesis and in two diseases probably related to aging. PATIENT SUMMARY: We propose that APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis can generate clinically relevant driver mutations even within suboptimal motifs, such as in the case of FGFR3 S249C, one of the most common mutations in bladder cancer. Knowledge about the etiology of this mutation will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer.","['APOBEC Deaminases/*genetics', 'Aminohydrolases/genetics', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics', 'Mutagenesis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']","['Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Type', 'BLAST sequence alignment type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
20829345,Placobranchus ocellatus,"Sacoglossan sea slugs are unique in the animal kingdom in that they sequester and maintain active plastids that they acquire from the siphonaceous algae upon which they feed, making the animals photosynthetic. Although most sacoglossan species digest their freshly ingested plastids within hours, four species from the family Plakobranchidae retain their stolen plastids (kleptoplasts) in a photosynthetically active state on timescales of weeks to months. The molecular basis of plastid maintenance within the cytosol of digestive gland cells in these photosynthetic metazoans is yet unknown but is widely thought to involve gene transfer from the algal food source to the slugs based upon previous investigations of single genes. Indeed, normal plastid development requires hundreds of nuclear-encoded proteins, with protein turnover in photosystem II in particular known to be rapid under various conditions. Moreover, only algal plastids, not the algal nuclei, are sequestered by the animals during feeding. If algal nuclear genes are transferred to the animal either during feeding or in the germ line, and if they are expressed, then they should be readily detectable with deep-sequencing methods. We have sequenced expressed mRNAs from actively photosynthesizing, starved individuals of two photosynthetic sea slug species, Plakobranchus ocellatus Van Hasselt, 1824 and Elysia timida Risso, 1818. We find that nuclear-encoded, algal-derived genes specific to photosynthetic function are expressed neither in P. ocellatus nor in E. timida. Despite their dramatic plastid longevity, these photosynthetic sacoglossan slugs do not express genes acquired from algal nuclei in order to maintain plastid function.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'Chlorophyta/cytology/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gastropoda/classification/*genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Photosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Plastids/*genetics/ultrastructure']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Expressed gene list', 'Sequence tag profile', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcript report', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Plant biology', 'Plasmid map', 'Lipids']"
33303811,Profiling of miRNAs involved in liver carcinogenesis by age,"Streptozotocin administration to mice (STZ-mice) induces type I diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We attempted to elucidate the carcinogenic mechanism and the miRNA expression status in the liver and blood during the precancerous state. Serum and liver tissues were collected from STZ-mice and non-treated mice (CTL-mice) at 6, 10, and 12 W. The exosome enriched fraction extracted from serum was used. Hepatic histological examination and hepatic and exosomal miRNA expression analysis were serially performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Human miRNA expression analysis of chronic hepatitis liver tissue and exosomes, which were collected before starting the antiviral treatment, were also performed. No inflammation or fibrosis was found in the liver of CTL-mice during the observation period. In STZ-mice, regeneration and inflammation of hepatocytes was found at 6 W and nodules of atypical hepatocytes were found at 10 and 12 W. In the liver tissue, during 6-12 W, the expression levels of let-7f-5p, miR-143-3p, 148a-3p, 191-5p, 192-5p, 21a-5p, 22-3p, 26a-5p, and 92a-3p was significantly increased in STZ-mice, and anti-oncogenes of their target gene candidates were down-regulated. miR-122-5p was also significantly down-regulated in STZ-mice. Fifteen exosomal miRNAs were upregulated in STZ-mice. Six miRNAs (let-7f-5p, miR-10b-5p, 143-3p, 191-5p, 21a-5p, and 26a-5p) were upregulated, similarly to human HCC cases. From the precancerous state, aberrant expression of hepatic miRNAs has already occurred, and then, it can promote carcinogenesis. In exosomes, the expression pattern of common miRNAs between mice and humans before carcinogenesis was observed and can be expected to be developed as a cancer predictive marker.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/*blood', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/*blood', 'Precancerous Conditions/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Exome sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Plasmid map', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Consensus tree construction', 'affymetrix-exp', 'Active site prediction', 'Gene prediction', 'Structure prediction']"
33172933,"Genome-wide characterization of platinum persister ovarian cancer (OC) cells with upregulation of Wnt pathway receptor, Frizzled 7 (FZD7)","Defining traits of platinum-tolerant cancer cells could expose new treatment vulnerabilities. Here, new markers associated with platinum-tolerant cells and tumors were identified using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> ovarian cancer models treated repetitively with carboplatin and validated in human specimens. Platinum-tolerant cells and tumors were enriched in ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells, formed more spheroids, and expressed increased levels of stemness-related transcription factors compared with parental cells. Additionally, platinum-tolerant cells and tumors exhibited expression of the Wnt receptor <i>Frizzled-7</i> (<i>FZD7</i>). Knockdown of FZD7 improved sensitivity to platinum, decreased spheroid formation, and delayed tumor initiation. The molecular signature distinguishing FZD7<sup>+</sup> from FZD7<sup>-</sup> cells included epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT), stemness, and oxidative phosphorylation-enriched gene sets. Overexpression of FZD7 activated the oncogenic factor <i>Tp63</i>, driving upregulation of glutathione metabolism pathways, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which protected cells from chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress. FZD7<sup>+</sup> platinum-tolerant ovarian cancer cells were more sensitive and underwent ferroptosis after treatment with GPX4 inhibitors. <i>FZD7, Tp63</i>, and glutathione metabolism gene sets were strongly correlated in the ovarian cancer Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and in residual human ovarian cancer specimens after chemotherapy. These results support the existence of a platinum-tolerant cell population with partial cancer stem cell features, characterized by FZD7 expression and dependent on the FZD7-β-catenin-Tp63-GPX4 pathway for survival. The findings reveal a novel therapeutic vulnerability of platinum-tolerant cancer cells and provide new insight into a potential ""persister cancer cell"" phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: Frizzled-7 marks platinum-tolerant cancer cells harboring stemness features and altered glutathione metabolism that depend on GPX4 for survival and are highly susceptible to ferroptosis.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Ferroptosis', 'Frizzled Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Generation', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Error', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein variants', 'Variant classification', 'Variant calling', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Date', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
33574060,Molecular reprogramming and phenotype switching in Staphylococcus aureus lead to high antibiotic persistence and affect therapy success,"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> causes invasive infections and easily acquires antibiotic resistance. Even antibiotic-susceptible <i>S. aureus</i> can survive antibiotic therapy and persist, requiring prolonged treatment and surgical interventions. These so-called persisters display an arrested-growth phenotype, tolerate high antibiotic concentrations, and are associated with chronic and recurrent infections. To characterize these persisters, we assessed <i>S. aureus</i> recovered directly from a patient suffering from a persistent infection. We show that host-mediated stress, including acidic pH, abscess environment, and antibiotic exposure promoted persister formation in vitro and in vivo. Multiomics analysis identified molecular changes in <i>S. aureus</i> in response to acid stress leading to an overall virulent population. However, further analysis of a persister-enriched population revealed major molecular reprogramming in persisters, including down-regulation of virulence and cell division and up-regulation of ribosomal proteins, nucleotide-, and amino acid-metabolic pathways, suggesting their requirement to fuel and maintain the persister phenotype and highlighting that persisters are not completely metabolically inactive. Additionally, decreased aconitase activity and ATP levels and accumulation of insoluble proteins involved in transcription, translation, and energy production correlated with persistence in <i>S. aureus</i>, underpinning the molecular mechanisms that drive the persister phenotype. Upon regrowth, these persisters regained their virulence potential and metabolically active phenotype, including reduction of insoluble proteins, exhibiting a reversible state, crucial for recurrent infections. We further show that a targeted antipersister combination therapy using retinoid derivatives and antibiotics significantly reduced lag-phase heterogeneity and persisters in a murine infection model. Our results provide molecular insights into persisters and help explain why persistent <i>S. aureus</i> infections are so difficult to treat.","['Aconitate Hydratase/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', '*Metabolome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Phenotype', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity']","['Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate accession', 'Carbohydrate report', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'Drug report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Metabolomics', 'Metabolites', 'Metabolic disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Statistical inference', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Locus ID']"

To effectively develop targeted pest control strategies for diverse Spodoptera species, genomic resources are highly desired. To this aim, we provide the genome assembly and developmental transcriptome comprising all major life stages of S. exigua, the beet armyworm. Spodoptera exigua is a polyphagous herbivore that can feed on > 130 host plants, including several economically important crops. The 419 Mb beet armyworm genome was sequenced from a female S. exigua pupa. Using a hybrid genome sequencing approach (Nanopore long-read data and Illumina short read), a high-quality genome assembly was achieved (N50 = 1.1 Mb). An official gene set (18,477 transcripts) was generated by automatic annotation and by using transcriptomic RNA-seq datasets of 18 S. exigua samples as supporting evidence. In-depth analyses of developmental stage-specific expression combined with gene tree analyses of identified homologous genes across Lepidoptera genomes revealed four potential genes of interest (three of them Spodoptera-specific) upregulated during first- and third-instar larval stages for targeted pest-outbreak management. The beet armyworm genome sequence and developmental transcriptome covering all major developmental stages provide critical insights into the biology of this devastating polyphagous insect pest species worldwide. In addition, comparative genomic analyses across Lepidoptera significantly advance our knowledge to further control other invasive Spodoptera species and reveals potential lineage-specific target genes for pest control strategies.","['Animals', '*Beta vulgaris', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Larva', 'Pest Control', 'Pupa', 'Spodoptera/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Beta diversity data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'Score end gaps control']"
32676987,Variability in cerebrospinal fluid microRNAs through life,"The development of the human brain starts in the first weeks of embryo differentiation. However, there are many relevant neurodevelopmental processes that take place after birth and during lifespan. Such a fine and changing scenario requires the coordinated expression of thousands of genes to achieve the proper specialization and inter-connectivity. In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs), which can modulate mRNA stability and translation, are gaining recognition for their involvement in both brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) miRNAs should be perfectly differentiated in relevant age periods. In this study, we aimed to highlight the biological variability of miRNA expression in the CSF throughout life, which is also crucial for biomarker discovery in CNS pathologies, especially in children, where they are desperately needed. We analyzed the CSF microRNAome of 14 healthy children (aged 0-7.4 years) by smallRNA-Seq and compared it with previously published data in adults (N = 7) and elders (N = 11). miR-423-5p and miR-22-3p were overexpressed in the < 1 and > 3 years groups, respectively. Additionally, we detected 18 miRNAs that reached their highest peak of expression at different time-points during the lifespan and sets of miRNAs that were exclusively expressed in a specific age group. On the contrary, miR-191-5p showed stable expression in CSF from the first year of life. Our results remark the complex differential miRNA expression profile that can be observed through life, which underlines the need for including appropriate age-matched controls when the expression of CSF miRNAs is analyzed in different pathological contexts.

32066955,EBF1-mutant bone marrow stroma confers long-term changes in hematopoietic stem cell potential,"Crosstalk between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is essential for hematopoietic homeostasis and lineage output. Here, we investigate how transcriptional changes in bone marrow (BM) MSCs result in long-lasting effects on HSCs. Single-cell analysis of Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup> (PαS) cells revealed an extensive cellular heterogeneity but uniform expression of the transcription factor gene Ebf1. Conditional deletion of Ebf1 in these MSCs altered their cellular composition, chromatin structure and gene expression profiles, including the reduced expression of adhesion-related genes. Functionally, the stromal-specific Ebf1 inactivation results in impaired adhesion of HSCs, leading to reduced quiescence and diminished myeloid output. Most notably, HSCs residing in the Ebf1-deficient niche underwent changes in their cellular composition and chromatin structure that persist in serial transplantations. Thus, genetic alterations in the BM niche lead to long-term functional changes of HSCs.","['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics/physiology', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Stem Cell Niche/genetics/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Transposon prediction', 'Regenerative medicine', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Single particle analysis', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Transcription factor accession', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
31755865,"Genome-wide mapping of SET-Nup214, mutant NPM1 (NPM1c), and CRM1-binding sites in human leukemia or mouse ES cell lines","We previously demonstrated that CRM1, a major nuclear export factor, accumulates at <i>Hox</i> cluster regions to recruit nucleoporin-fusion protein Nup98HoxA9, resulting in robust activation of <i>Hox</i> genes (Oka et al., 2016). However, whether this phenomenon is general to other leukemogenic proteins remains unknown. Here, we show that two other leukemogenic proteins, nucleoporin-fusion SET-Nup214 and the NPM1 mutant, NPM1c, which contains a nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminus and is one of the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, are recruited to the <i>HOX</i> cluster region via chromatin-bound CRM1, leading to <i>HOX</i> gene activation in human leukemia cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism is highly sensitive to a CRM1 inhibitor in leukemia cell line. Together, these findings indicate that CRM1 acts as a key molecule that connects leukemogenic proteins to aberrant <i>HOX</i> gene regulation either via nucleoporin-CRM1 interaction (for SET-Nup214) or NES-CRM1 interaction (for NPM1c).","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Export Signals/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics']","['Transposon prediction', 'Active site prediction', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Histogram', 'Operon', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Expression signals', 'Sequence signature report', 'Nucleic acid signature', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'nucleotide', 'COSMIC ID', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

Through integrative analyses of those tissue-specific genes with large-scale genome-wide association studies, we detected relevant tissues/cell types and candidate genes for 45 economically important traits in cattle, including blood/immune system (e.g., <i>CCDC88C</i>) for male fertility, brain (e.g., <i>TRIM46</i> and <i>RAB6A</i>) for milk production, and multiple growth-related tissues (e.g., <i>FGF6</i> and <i>CCND2</i>) for body conformation. We validated these findings by using epigenomic data across major somatic tissues and sperm.

31585941,A comprehensive PDX gastric cancer collection captures cancer cell intrinsic transcriptional MSI traits.,"Gastric cancer is the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality. In spite of significant therapeutic improvements, the clinical outcome for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor; thus, the identification and validation of novel targets is extremely important from a clinical point of view. We generated a wide, multilevel platform of gastric cancer models, comprising 100 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), primary cell lines, and organoids. Samples were classified according to their histology, microsatellite stability, Epstein-Barr virus status, and molecular profile. This PDX platform is the widest in an academic institution, and it includes all the gastric cancer histologic and molecular types identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas. PDX histopathologic features were consistent with those of patients' primary tumors and were maintained throughout passages in mice. Factors modulating grafting rate were histology, TNM stage, copy number gain of tyrosine kinases/<i>KRAS</i> genes, and microsatellite stability status. PDX and PDX-derived cells/organoids demonstrated potential usefulness to study targeted therapy response. Finally, PDX transcriptomic analysis identified a cancer cell-intrinsic microsatellite instability (MSI) signature, which was efficiently exported to gastric cancer, allowing the identification, among microsatellite stable (MSS) patients, of a subset of MSI-like tumors with common molecular aspects and significant better prognosis. In conclusion, we generated a wide gastric cancer PDX platform, whose exploitation will help identify and validate novel ""druggable"" targets and optimize therapeutic strategies. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of gastric cancer PDXs allowed the identification of a cancer cell-intrinsic MSI signature, recognizing a subset of MSS patients with MSI transcriptional traits, endowed with better prognosis.

The data was obtained from two separate TMT 10-plex experiments. TMT set1 includes a time course experiment upon pevonedistat treatment of CNDT2 cells with harvests at 2h, 6h, 12h and 24h after treatment as well as of untreated control cells.

Here, protein expression profiling was performed by HiRIEF-LC-MS in 14 primary SI-NETs from patients with and without liver metastases detected at the time of surgery and initial treatment. Among differentially expressed proteins, overexpression of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 was identified in samples from patients with liver metastasis. Further, NEDD8 correlation analysis indicated co-expression with RBX1, a key component in cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). In vitro inhibition of neddylation with the therapeutic agent pevonedistat (MLN4924) resulted in a dramatic decrease of proliferation in SI-NET cell lines. Subsequent mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of pevonedistat effects and effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib revealed stabilization of multiple targets of CRLs including p27, an established tumor suppressor in SI-NET. Silencing of NEDD8 and RBX1 using siRNA resulted in a stabilization of p27, suggesting that the cellular levels of NEDD8 and RBX1 affect CRL activity. Inhibition of CRL activity, by either NEDD8/RBX1 silencing or pevonedistat treatment of cells resulted in induction of apoptosis that could be partially rescued by siRNA-based silencing of p27. Differential expression of both p27 and NEDD8 was confirmed in a second cohort of SI-NET using immunohistochemistry. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for CRLs and the ubiquitin proteasome system in suppression of p27 in SI-NET, and inhibition of neddylation as a putative therapeutic strategy in SI-NET.","['Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NEDD8 Protein/metabolism', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene set testing', 'MAT', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'RNA', 'rna']"

Interestingly, influenza A virus infection led to numerous cell line-specific responses affecting both protein abundance as well as subcellular localization. In A549 cells, the vesicular compartment appeared expanded after virus infection. The composition of autophagsomes was altered by targeting of ribosomes, viral mRNA and proteins to these double membrane vesicles. Thus, autophagy may support viral protein translation by promoting the clustering of the respective molecular machinery in autophagosomes in a cell line-dependent manner.","['Autophagosomes/*metabolism', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*metabolism', 'Influenza, Human/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/metabolism']","['Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA central ID', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Ribosome Profiling']"

We recently identified PWWP2A as a binder for H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes (Pünzeler, S. et al., EMBO J 2017). Here, as part of a larger project trying to characterize PWWP2A, we performed pulldowns using PWWP2A as a bait protein.

We recently identified that PWWP2A tightly binds to H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes and is involved in mitotic progression and cranial-facial development. Here, using in vitro assays, we show that distinct domains of PWWP2A mediate binding to free linker DNA as well as H3K36me3 nucleosomes. In vivo, PWWP2A strongly recognizes H2A.Z-containing regulatory regions and weakly binds H3K36me3-containing gene bodies. Further, PWWP2A binds to an MTA1-specific subcomplex of the NuRD complex (M1HR), which consists solely of MTA1, HDAC1, and RBBP4/7, and excludes CHD, GATAD2 and MBD proteins. Depletion of PWWP2A leads to an increase of acetylation levels on H3K27 as well as H2A.Z, presumably by impaired chromatin recruitment of M1HR. Thus, this study identifies PWWP2A as a complex chromatin-binding protein that serves to direct the deacetylase complex M1HR to H2A.Z-containing chromatin, thereby promoting changes in histone acetylation levels.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Proteins', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Nucleic acid folding analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor accession']"

30923110,We analyzed the brain of 5 day old mice with homozygous and heterozygous brain specific UCHL1 knockout using nLC-MS/MS.,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is one of the most abundant and enigmatic enzymes of the CNS. Based on existing UCH-L1 knockout models, UCH-L1 is thought to be required for the maintenance of axonal integrity, but not for neuronal development despite its high expression in neurons. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for UCH-L1 in mUB homeostasis, although the specific in vivo substrate remains elusive. Since the precise mechanisms underlying UCH-L1-deficient neurodegeneration remain unclear, we generated a transgenic mouse model of UCH-L1 deficiency. By performing biochemical and behavioral analyses we can show that UCH-L1 deficiency causes an acceleration of sensorimotor reflex development in the first postnatal week followed by a degeneration of motor function starting at periadolescence in the setting of normal cerebral mUB levels. In the first postnatal weeks, neuronal protein synthesis and proteasomal protein degradation are enhanced, with endoplasmic reticulum stress, and energy depletion, leading to proteasomal impairment and an accumulation of nondegraded ubiquitinated protein. Increased protein turnover is associated with enhanced mTORC1 activity restricted to the postnatal period in UCH-L1-deficient brains. Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin decreases protein synthesis and ubiquitin accumulation in UCH-L1-deficient neurons. Strikingly, rapamycin treatment in the first 8 postnatal days ameliorates the neurological phenotype of UCH-L1-deficient mice up to 16 weeks, suggesting that early control of protein homeostasis is imperative for long-term neuronal survival. In summary, we identified a critical presymptomatic period during which UCH-L1-dependent enhanced protein synthesis results in neuronal strain and progressive loss of neuronal function.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/deficiency/genetics/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Generation', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein data', 'Kinase name']"

Loss of MPP9 causes abnormal primary cilia formation in growing cells and mouse kidneys. After phosphorylation by Tau Tubulin Kinase 2 (TTBK2) at the beginning of ciliogenesis, MPP9 is targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which facilitates the removal of CP110 and CEP97 from the distal end of the mother centriole.

We established high-quality datasets that enabled precise discrimination between cellular and physiological processes in laticifers and non-laticifer cell types of roots at different vegetative stages. We identified numerous latex-specific proteins, including a perilipin-like protein that has not been studied in plants yet. The barnase-expressing plants revealed a phenotype that did not exude latex, which may provide a valuable genetic basis for future studies of plant-environment interactions concerning latex and also help to clarify the evolution and arbitrary distribution of latex throughout the plant kingdom. The overview of temporal changes in composition and protein abundance provided by our data opens the way for a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions, reactions, and network relationships that underlie the different metabolic pathways in the roots of this potential rubber crop.","['Biology', '*Latex', 'Metabolome', 'Proteome', '*Taraxacum']","['Biology', 'Cell biology', 'Marine biology', 'latex', 'Metabolomics', 'Metabolites', 'Metabolic disease', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'TAR format']"

Several aphid salivary proteomes have been identified and found to differ according to the species, while no comparative investigation between phytophagous stink bugs has been performed yet. Here we analyzed the salivary proteins from two bugs, BMSB and SGSB, using LC-MS/MS. A total of 238 and 305 proteins were identified from dissected salivary glands from BMSB and SGSB respectively. Among these, a large majority was found in both species. In comparison with salivary proteome from other Hemiptera, the most striking feature of the salivary gland proteomes from SGSB and BMSB is the similar protein functions patterns. Some of the proteins are speculated to be dependent of the feeding strategies, playing a significant role in plant-insect interactions. Our results provide a framework for future research to elucidate the molecular basis of differential impact of piercing-sucking insects on host plants.","The invasive brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys Stål, and the southern green stink bugs (SGSBs), Nezara viridula L., are widely distributed in Europe, even if the date of introduction and the diet differ.

34768965,RNA-seq analysis of Mycobacterium Smegmatis ΔF6 vs. Wild type,"Regulatory small non-coding RNAs play a significant role in bacterial adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Various stresses such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation cause a reduction in the metabolic activity of <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>, leading to entry into dormancy. We investigated the functional role of F6, a small RNA of <i>M. smegmatis</i>, and constructed an F6 deletion strain of <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Using the RNA-seq approach, we demonstrated that gene expression changes that accompany F6 deletion contributed to bacterial resistance against oxidative stress. We also found that F6 directly interacted with 5'-UTR of <i>MSMEG_4640</i> mRNA encoding RpfE2, a resuscitation-promoting factor, which led to the downregulation of RpfE2 expression. The F6 deletion strain was characterized by the reduced ability to enter into dormancy (non-culturability) in the potassium deficiency model compared to the wild-type strain, indicating that F6 significantly contributes to bacterial adaptation to non-optimal growth conditions.","[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adaptation, Physiological/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Multigene Family', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis/*genetics/growth & development/physiology', 'RNA, Bacterial/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Untranslated/*genetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics']","['Protein membrane regions', 'DNA translation', 'Protein modifications', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Sequence', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Mathematical model']"
33397934,scRNA-seq of mouse thymocyte CD4 CD8 lineage choice and differentiation,"CD4 and CD8 mark helper and cytotoxic T cell lineages, respectively, and serve as coreceptors for MHC-restricted TCR recognition. How coreceptor expression is matched with TCR specificity is central to understanding CD4/CD8 lineage choice, but visualising coreceptor gene activity in individual selection intermediates has been technically challenging. It therefore remains unclear whether the sequence of coreceptor gene expression in selection intermediates follows a stereotypic pattern, or is responsive to signaling. Here we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to classify mouse thymocyte selection intermediates by coreceptor gene expression. In the unperturbed thymus, Cd4<sup>+</sup>Cd8a<sup>-</sup> selection intermediates appear before Cd4<sup>-</sup>Cd8a<sup>+</sup> selection intermediates, but the timing of these subsets is flexible according to the strength of TCR signals. Our data show that selection intermediates discriminate MHC class prior to the loss of coreceptor expression and suggest a model where signal strength informs the timing of coreceptor gene activity and ultimately CD4/CD8 lineage choice.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage/*immunology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Bit score', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Proteins', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Statistics and probability', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'ELAND format', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
32735318,Comparison of the hepatic effects of phenobarbital in chimeric mice containing either rat or human hepatocytes with humanized constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) mice (hCAR/hPXR mice) [chimeric humanized liver experiments],"Using a chimeric mouse humanized liver model, we provided evidence that human hepatocytes are refractory to the mitogenic effects of rodent constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activators. To evaluate the functional reliability of this model, the present study examined mitogenic responses to phenobarbital (PB) in chimeric mice transplanted with rat hepatocytes, because rats are responsive to CAR activators. Treatment with 1000 ppm PB for 7 days significantly increased replicative DNA synthesis (RDS) in rat hepatocytes of the chimeric mice, demonstrating that the transplanted hepatocyte model is functionally reliable for cell proliferation analysis. Treatment of humanized CAR and pregnane X receptor (PXR) mice (hCAR/hPXR mice) with 1000 ppm PB for 7 days significantly increased hepatocyte RDS together with increases in several mitogenic genes. Global gene expression analysis was performed with liver samples from this and from previous studies focusing on PB-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and showed that altered genes in hCAR/hPXR mice clustered most closely with liver tumor samples from a diethylnitrosamine/PB initiation/promotion study than with wild-type mice. However, different gene clusters were observed for chimeric mice with human hepatocytes for Wnt/β-catenin signaling when compared with those of hCAR/hPXR mice, wild-type mice, and liver tumor samples. The results of this study demonstrate clear differences in the effects of PB on hepatocyte RDS and global gene expression between human hepatocytes of chimeric mice and hCAR/hPXR mice, suggesting that the chimeric mouse model is relevant to humans for studies on the hepatic effects of rodent CAR activators whereas the hCAR/hPXR mouse is not.","['Animals', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Mice', '*Phenobarbital/toxicity', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', '*Receptors, Steroid', 'Reproducibility of Results']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'QSAR descriptor (constitutional)', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenomics', 'Phenotype name', 'Phenomenon identifier', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Plasmid map', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results']"
32555671,Patient genetics is linked to chronic wound microbiome composition and healing,"The clinical importance of microbiomes to the chronicity of wounds is widely appreciated, yet little is understood about patient-specific processes shaping wound microbiome composition. Here, a two-cohort microbiome-genome wide association study is presented through which patient genomic loci associated with chronic wound microbiome diversity were identified. Further investigation revealed that alternative TLN2 and ZNF521 genotypes explained significant inter-patient variation in relative abundance of two key pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wound diversity was lowest in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected wounds, and decreasing wound diversity had a significant negative linear relationship with healing rate. In addition to microbiome characteristics, age, diabetic status, and genetic ancestry all significantly influenced healing. Using structural equation modeling to identify common variance among SNPs, six loci were sufficient to explain 53% of variation in wound microbiome diversity, which was a 10% increase over traditional multiple regression. Focusing on TLN2, genotype at rs8031916 explained expression differences of alternative transcripts that differ in inclusion of important focal adhesion binding domains. Such differences are hypothesized to relate to wound microbiomes and healing through effects on bacterial exploitation of focal adhesions and/or cellular migration. Related, other associated loci were functionally enriched, often with roles in cytoskeletal dynamics. This study, being the first to identify patient genetic determinants for wound microbiomes and healing, implicates genetic variation determining cellular adhesion phenotypes as important drivers of infection type. The identification of predictive biomarkers for chronic wound microbiomes may serve as risk factors and guide treatment by informing patient-specific tendencies of infection.","['Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Microbiota', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Pseudomonas Infections/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa', '*Staphylococcal Infections/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', '*Staphylococcus epidermidis', 'Talin/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wound Healing/*genetics', '*Wound Infection/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/pathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Infectious disease', 'Statistical inference', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Medical informatics', 'Biomedical science', 'Heat map', 'Selection detection', 'Information extraction']"
34331868,Transcriptomic analysis of neonatal supporting cells after histone modification perturbations,"Adult mammalian tissues such as heart, brain, retina, and the sensory structures of the inner ear do not effectively regenerate, although a latent capacity for regeneration exists at embryonic and perinatal times. We explored the epigenetic basis for this latent regenerative potential in the mouse inner ear and its rapid loss during maturation. In perinatal supporting cells, whose fate is maintained by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, the hair cell enhancer network is epigenetically primed (H3K4me1) but silenced (active H3K27 de-acetylation and trimethylation). Blocking Notch signaling during the perinatal period of plasticity rapidly eliminates epigenetic silencing and allows supporting cells to transdifferentiate into hair cells. Importantly, H3K4me1 priming of the hair cell enhancers in supporting cells is removed during the first post-natal week, coinciding with the loss of transdifferentiation potential. We hypothesize that enhancer decommissioning during cochlear maturation contributes to the failure of hair cell regeneration in the mature organ of Corti.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Hair Cells, Auditory/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Regeneration/*physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Mice or rats', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Nucleic acid sequence record']"

Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione. Among several metabolites formed, 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium. Although sulcotrione has a chemical structure closely resembling that of mesotrione, the isolates were unable to degrade it.","['Bacillus/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Cyclohexanones/*metabolism', 'Ecology/methods', 'Herbicides/*metabolism', '*Soil Microbiology', 'Soil Pollutants/*metabolism']","['Gene name (Bacillus subtilis)', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Cell cycle', 'Ecology', 'Ecological data', 'Microbiology', 'Biology', 'Plant biology']"
34504070,Variant PCGF1-PRC1 links PRC2 recruitment with induced transcriptional inactivation at target genes [CUT&Tag],"Polycomb repressive complexes-1 and -2 (PRC1 and 2) silence developmental genes in a spatiotemporal manner during embryogenesis. How Polycomb group (PcG) proteins orchestrate down-regulation of target genes upon differentiation, however, remains elusive. Here, by differentiating embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies, we reveal a crucial role for the PCGF1-containing variant PRC1 complex (PCGF1-PRC1) to mediate differentiation-associated down-regulation of a group of genes. Upon differentiation cues, transcription is down-regulated at these genes, in association with PCGF1-PRC1-mediated deposition of histone H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub1) and PRC2 recruitment. In the absence of PCGF1-PRC1, both H2AK119ub1 deposition and PRC2 recruitment are disrupted, leading to aberrant expression of target genes. PCGF1-PRC1 is, therefore, required for initiation and consolidation of PcG-mediated gene repression during differentiation.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Ubiquitination']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Mammals', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Histogram', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence report', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

We investigated circulating plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers of liver injury in patients mono-infected with HIV-1. We performed large-scale deep sequencing analyses of small RNA level on plasma samples from patients with HIV-1 mono-infection that had elevated or normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infected patients were also studied. Compared to healthy donors, patients with HIV-1 or HCV mono-infections showed significantly altered (fold change >2, adjusted p < 0.05) level of 25 and 70 miRNAs, respectively. Of the 25 altered miRNAs found in patients with HIV-1, 19 were also found in patients mono-infected with HCV. Moreover, 13 of the 14 most up-regulated miRNAs (range: 9.3-3.4-fold increase) in patients with HCV mono-infections were also up-regulated in patients with HIV-1 mono-infections. Importantly, most of these miRNAs significantly and positively correlated with ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and liver fibrosis stage (p < 0.05). MiR-122-3p and miR-193b-5p were highly up-regulated HIV-1 mono-infected patients with elevated ALT or FNH, but not in HIV-1 patients with normal levels of ALT. These results reveal that HIV-1 infections impacted liver-related miRNA levels in the absence of an HCV co-infection, which highlights the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for the progression of liver injury in HIV-1 infected patients.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Circulating MicroRNA/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver/*injuries/virology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/genetics/virology', 'Liver Diseases/*genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral Load']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Infectious disease', 'Protein interactions', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'HIVDB identifier', 'HIVDB entry format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Rare diseases', 'MAT', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Parsing']"

However, the role of this Nef function in virus-mediated immune activation and pathogenicity remains speculative. Here, we selectively disrupted this Nef activity in SIV<sub>mac239</sub> and analyzed the consequences for the virological, immunological, and clinical outcome of infection in rhesus macaques. The inability to downmodulate CD3-TCR does not impair viral replication during acute infection but is associated with increased immune activation and antiviral gene expression. Subsequent early reversion in three of six animals suggests strong selective pressure for this Nef function and is associated with high viral loads and progression to simian AIDS. In the absence of reversions, however, viral replication and the clinical course of infection are attenuated. Thus, Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 dampens the inflammatory response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and seems critical for efficient viral immune evasion.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Products, nef', 'Immune Evasion/*immunology', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/immunology', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein report', 'Gene ID', 'Natural product identification', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', ""Ensembl ID ('Macaca mulatta')"", 'MAT', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Protein accession', 'Gene regulatory network processing']"
33159078,Investigation of the gene expression changes triggered by the lung mesenchymal Tsc2KO in each major cell subpopulation of the adult mouse lung,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare fatal cystic lung disease due to bi-allelic inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) genes coding for suppressors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The origin of LAM cells is still unknown. Here, we profile a LAM lung compared to an age- and sex-matched healthy control lung as a hypothesis-generating approach to identify cell subtypes that are specific to LAM. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals novel mesenchymal and transitional alveolar epithelial states unique to LAM lung. This analysis identifies a mesenchymal cell hub coordinating the LAM disease phenotype. Mesenchymal-restricted deletion of Tsc2 in the mouse lung produces a mTORC1-driven pulmonary phenotype, with a progressive disruption of alveolar structure, a decline in pulmonary function, increase of rapamycin-sensitive expression of WNT ligands, and profound female-specific changes in mesenchymal and epithelial lung cell gene expression. Genetic inactivation of WNT signaling reverses age-dependent changes of mTORC1-driven lung phenotype, but WNT activation alone in lung mesenchyme is not sufficient for the development of mouse LAM-like phenotype. The alterations in gene expression are driven by distinctive crosstalk between mesenchymal and epithelial subsets of cells observed in mesenchymal Tsc2-deficient lungs. This study identifies sex- and age-specific gene changes in the mTORC1-activated lung mesenchyme and establishes the importance of the WNT signaling pathway in the mTORC1-driven lung phenotype.","['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Lymphangioleiomyomatosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mesoderm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Sex Factors', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']","['Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein complex', 'Keyword', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Virology', 'protein', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping']"

In the healthy brain tissue, we first uncover interactions between different histone marks and non-CG methylation in the CAC context. Additionally, we find that ELA associates with methylomic changes that are as frequent in the CAC as in the canonical CG context, while these two forms of plasticity occur in sharply distinct genomic regions, features, and chromatin states. Combining these multiple data indicates that immune-related and small GTPase signaling pathways are most consistently impaired in the amygdala of ELA individuals.

Metabolic diseases including obesity and insulin resistance are associated with low mitochondrial capacity in skeletal muscle. Certain transcriptional factors such as PGC-1α are known to mediate the exercise response; however, the precise molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation to exercise are not completely understood. We performed multiple measurements of mitochondrial capacity both in vivo and ex vivo in lean or overweight individuals before and after an 18-day aerobic exercise training regimen. These results were compared to lean, active individuals.

However, little is known about the homeostatic anti-inflammatory activities of astrocytes and their regulation. Here, using high-throughput flow cytometry screening, single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9-based cell-specific in vivo genetic perturbations in mice, we identify a subset of astrocytes that expresses the lysosomal protein LAMP1<sup>2</sup> and the death receptor ligand TRAIL<sup>3</sup>. LAMP1<sup>+</sup>TRAIL<sup>+</sup> astrocytes limit inflammation in the CNS by inducing T cell apoptosis through TRAIL-DR5 signalling. In homeostatic conditions, the expression of TRAIL in astrocytes is driven by interferon-γ (IFNγ) produced by meningeal natural killer (NK) cells, in which IFNγ expression is modulated by the gut microbiome. TRAIL expression in astrocytes is repressed by molecules produced by T cells and microglia in the context of inflammation.

Here, we report the identification of an evolutionarily conserved WD40 domain protein as a player in miRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. A mutation in the REDUCTION IN BLEACHED VEIN AREA (RBV) gene encoding a WD40 domain protein led to the suppression of leaf bleaching caused by an artificial miRNA; the mutation also led to a global reduction in the accumulation of endogenous miRNAs. The nuclear protein RBV promotes the transcription of MIR genes into pri-miRNAs by enhancing the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at MIR gene promoters. RBV also promotes the loading of miRNAs into AGO1. In addition, RNA-seq revealed a global splicing defect in the mutant. Thus, this evolutionarily conserved, nuclear WD40 domain protein acts in miRNA biogenesis and RNA splicing.","['*Arabidopsis/genetics/metabolism', '*Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Argonaute Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'WD40 Repeats']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Repeat sequences']"

We measured the electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, proline content, and net photosynthesis rate (Pn) of the seedlings, which showed that EBR treatment increased cold tolerance in cotton in a dose-dependent manner, and that 0.2 mg/L is an optimum concentration for enhancing cold tolerance. The function of EBR in cotton cotyledons was investigated in the control 0 mg/L (Cold+water) and 0.2 mg/L (Cold+EBR) treatments using RNA-Seq.

In mammals, sexually dimorphic differentiation commences in the primordial germ cells (PGCs) in embryonic gonads; PGCs in ovaries and testes differentiate into meiotic primary oocytes and mitotically quiescent prospermatogonia, respectively. Here, we show that the transition from PGCs to sex-specific germ cells was abrogated in conditional knockout mice carrying a null mutation of Smarcb1 (also known as Snf5) gene, which encodes a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. In female mutant mice, failure to upregulate meiosis-related genes resulted in impaired meiotic entry and progression, including defects in synapsis formation and DNA double strand break repair. Mutant male mice exhibited delayed mitotic arrest and DNA hypomethylation in retrotransposons and imprinted genes, resulting from aberrant expression of genes related to growth and de novo DNA methylation.

34764283,Epigenetic reprogramming of airway macrophages drives polarization and inflammation in muco-obstructive lung disease (RNA_Treat),"Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by mucus obstruction and chronic airway inflammation, but their mechanistic link remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the function of the mucostatic airway microenvironment on epigenetic reprogramming of airway macrophages (AM) and resulting transcriptomic and phenotypical changes. Using a mouse model of muco-obstructive lung disease (Scnn1b-transgenic), we identify epigenetically controlled, differentially regulated pathways and transcription factors involved in inflammatory responses and macrophage polarization. Functionally, AMs from Scnn1b-transgenic mice have reduced efferocytosis and phagocytosis, and excessive inflammatory responses upon lipopolysaccharide challenge, mediated through enhanced Irf1 function and expression. Ex vivo stimulation of wild-type AMs with native mucus impairs efferocytosis and phagocytosis capacities. In addition, mucus induces gene expression changes, comparable with those observed in AMs from Scnn1b-transgenic mice. Our data show that mucostasis induces epigenetic reprogramming of AMs, leading to changes favoring tissue damage and disease progression. Targeting these altered AMs may support therapeutic approaches in patients with muco-obstructive lung diseases.","['Animals', 'Cystic Fibrosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Epithelial Sodium Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/genetics/physiology', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Cytometry', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular docking', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Respiratory medicine']"
32059760,A conserved kinase-based body temperature sensor globally controls alternative splicing and gene expression,"Homeothermic organisms maintain their core body temperature in a narrow, tightly controlled range. Whether and how subtle circadian oscillations or disease-associated changes in core body temperature are sensed and integrated in gene expression programs remain elusive. Furthermore, a thermo-sensor capable of sensing the small temperature differentials leading to temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in poikilothermic reptiles has not been identified. Here, we show that the activity of CDC-like kinases (CLKs) is highly responsive to physiological temperature changes, which is conferred by structural rearrangements within the kinase activation segment. Lower body temperature activates CLKs resulting in strongly increased phosphorylation of SR proteins in vitro and in vivo. This globally controls temperature-dependent alternative splicing and gene expression, with wide implications in circadian, tissue-specific, and disease-associated settings. This temperature sensor is conserved across evolution and adapted to growth temperatures of diverse poikilotherms.

Quantitative proteomics confirmed the constitutive expression of the linA, linB and linC genes of the HCH degradation pathway crucial for the initiation of HCH isomers degradation. LinM and LinN were upregulated in the presence of β- and δ-isomers suggested the important role of ABC transporter system in the depletion of β- and δ-HCH.

Sphingobium indicum B90A that belong to sphingomonad is well-known for its ability to degrade HCH isomers (α-, β-, γ-, δ-), but effects of HCH isomers and adaptive mechanisms of strain B90A under HCH load remain obscure. To investigate the responses of strain B90A to HCH isomers, we followed the proteomics approach as this technique is considered as the powerful tool to study the microbial response to environmental stress. Strain B90A culture was exposed to α-, β-, γ-, δ-HCH (5 mgL<sup>-1</sup>) and control (without HCH) taken for comparison and changes in whole cell proteome were analyzed. In β- and δ-HCH-treated cultures growth decreased significantly when compared to control, α-, and γ-HCH-treated cultures. HCH residue analysis corroborated previous observations depicting the complete depletion of α- and γ-HCH, while only 66% β-HCH and 34% δ-HCH were depleted from culture broth. Comparative proteome analyses showed that β- and δ-HCH induced utmost systemic changes in strain B90A proteome, wherein stress-alleviating proteins such as histidine kinases, molecular chaperons, DNA binding proteins, ABC transporters, TonB proteins, antioxidant enzymes, and transcriptional regulators were significantly affected. Besides study confirmed constitutive expression of linA, linB, and linC genes that are crucial for the initiation of HCH isomers degradation, while increased abundance of LinM and LinN in presence of β- and δ-HCH suggested the important role of ABC transporter in depletion of these isomers.

Establishing a novel mouse model that reflects the ARID1A heterozygous mutations found in the majority of human GC cases, we demonstrated that Arid1a heterozygosity facilitates tumor progression through a global loss of enhancers and subsequent suppression of the p53 and apoptosis pathways. Moreover, mouse genetic and single-cell analyses demonstrated that the homozygous deletion of Arid1a confers a competitive disadvantage through the activation of the p53 pathway, highlighting its distinct dosage-dependent roles.

It is important to fully understand the cellular and molecular basis underlying the specificity of peripheral nerve regeneration, which means achieving corresponding correct pathfinding and accurate target reinnervation for regrowing motor and sensory axons. In this study, a quantitative proteomic technique, based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), was used to profile the protein expression pattern between single motor and sensory nerves at 14 days after peripheral nerve transection.

Although several imputation methods exist to handle missing values, no single imputation method is best suited for a diverse range of data sets, and no clear strategy exists for evaluating imputation methods for large-scale DIA-MS data sets, especially at different levels of protein quantification. To navigate through the different imputation strategies available in the literature, we have established a workflow to assess imputation methods on large-scale label-free DIA-MS data sets.

We found that imputation methods based on local structures within the data, like local least-squares (LLS) and random forest (RF), worked well in our dilution series data set, whereas imputation methods based on global structures within the data, like BPCA, performed well in the other two data sets. We also found that imputation at the most basic protein quantification level-fragment level-improved accuracy and the number of proteins quantified. With this analytical framework, we quickly and cost-effectively evaluated different imputation methods using two smaller complementary data sets to narrow down to the larger proteomic data set's most accurate methods. This acquisition strategy allowed us to provide reproducible evidence of the accuracy of the imputation method, even in the absence of a ground truth. Overall, this study indicates that the most suitable imputation method relies on the overall structure of the data set and provides an example of an analytic framework that may assist in identifying the most appropriate imputation strategies for the differential analysis of proteins.","['*Algorithms', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Workflow']","['Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Workflow', 'Workflow ID', 'Workflow data']"
33649390,Transcriptome Analysis of Ciliary-Dependent MCH Signaling in Differentiating 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes,"An understanding of adipocyte responsiveness to G-protein-coupled receptor-(GPCR) derived signals must take into consideration the role of membrane microenvironments; that individual sub-populations of proteins may vary significantly across different regions of the cell, and that cell differentiation alters those microenvironments. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes undergo a dramatic phenotypic transformation during differentiation into adipocytes, requiring the development of a transient primary cilium. We demonstrate that melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) receptor 1, a GPCR that stimulates appetite, translocates to the transient primary cilium during early 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq to investigate whether MCH signaling is influenced by its receptor localization and whether MCH can influence the transcriptome of early adipocyte development. We found that MCH signaling is sensitive to receptor localization to cilia, and this alters the adipogenic transcriptional program. Also, novel MCH signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 cells are identified, including those for circadian rhythm, the inflammatory response, and ciliary biogenesis. The presence of active MCH-signaling pathways in pre-adipocytes and the discovery that these pathways intersect with the early adipogenic program, among other newly-identified signaling pathways, suggests that the use of MCH receptor 1 antagonists for clinical interventions may have unintended consequences on adipose tissue development.","['3T3-L1 Cells', '*Adipocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Adipogenesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Cilia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/*physiology', 'Transcriptome']","['cel', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'geneseq', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Phylogenetic tree reconciliation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
33579893,H3K27ac ChIP-seq for primary multiple myeloma patients’ samples (MM1-MM10),"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an aggressive plasma cell neoplasm characterized by genomic heterogeneity. Superenhancers (SEs) are defined as large clusters of enhancers in close genomic proximity, which regulate genes for maintaining cellular identity and promote oncogenic transcription to which cancer cells highly addicted. Here, we analyzed cis-regulatory elements in MM samples with H3K27ac ChIP-seq, to identify novel SE-associated genes involved in the myeloma pathogenesis. SEs and their associated genes in cancerous tissue were compared with the control samples, and we found SE analysis alone uncovered cell-lineage-specific transcription factors and well-known oncogenes ST3GAL6 and ADM. Using a transcriptional CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, coupled with H3K27ac ChlP-seq, we identified MAGI2 as a novel SE-associated gene of myeloma cells. Elevated MAGI2 was related to myelomagenesis with gradual increased expression from MGUS, SMM to newly diagnosed and relapsed MM. High prevalence of MAGI2 was also associated with poor survival of MM patients. Importantly, inhibition of the SE activity associated with MAGI2 decreased MAGI2 expression, inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we revealed that the oncogenic transcription factor, MAF, directly bound to the SE region and activated gene transcription. In summary, the discoveries of these acquired SEs-associated genes and the novel mechanism by which they are regulated provide new insights into MM biology and MAGI2-MAF-SE regulatory circuit offer potential novel targets for disease treatment.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Guanylate Kinases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf/genetics']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Proteins', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Kinase name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Sequence alignment', 'Multiple structure alignment', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'geneseq', 'protein', 'Protein data']"

We further evaluated practical predictors of the clinical prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Subsequent ELISA assays revealed that CHI3L1 and IGFALS may serve as highly sensitive prognostic markers.

Five replicate liver samples were collected from each group for proteomics analysis.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease, which progression is tightly regulated by transcription factors (TFs), nuclear receptors, and cellular enzymes. In this study, a label-free quantitative proteomic approach was used to determine the effect of the high-fat diet on the proteomics profile of liver tissue and to identify novel NAFLD related TFs. Mice were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to establish a NAFLD mouse model. Mice fed with normal chow diet were taken as controls. Liver samples were collected from each group for proteomics analysis. A total of 2298 proteins were quantified, among which 106 proteins were downregulated, while 256 proteins were upregulated in HFD-fed mice compared with the controls with fold change more than 1.5 and p value less than 0.05. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that metabolic-related functions and pathways were most significantly enriched. A subgroup of 11 TFs were observed to share interactions with metabolic-related enzymes and kinases by protein-protein interaction analysis. Among them, 7 TFs were selected for verification, and 3 TFs were finally validated, including Rbbp4, Tcea1, and ILF2. Downregulating each of the 3 TFs could significantly promote lipid accumulation in AML12 hepatocytes, by regulating the expression of fatty acid synthesis- or β-oxidation-related genes. In contrast, overexpression of Tcea1, Rbbp4, and ILF2, respectively, could ameliorate hepatocyte steatosis.

We find that GSDME facilitates the expression of mucins 1 and 13 in pancreatic tumor cells, which forms a barrier to prevent chymotrypsin-mediated destruction. Inoculation of GSDME-/- PDAC cells results in subcutaneous but not orthotopic tumor formation in mice.

33440143,Variability of an early developmental cell population underlies stochastic laterality defects,"Embryonic development seemingly proceeds with almost perfect precision. However, it is largely unknown how much underlying microscopic variability is compatible with normal development. Here, we quantify embryo-to-embryo variability in vertebrate development by studying cell number variation in the zebrafish endoderm. We notice that the size of a sub-population of the endoderm, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs, which later form the left-right organizer), exhibits significantly more embryo-to-embryo variation than the rest of the endoderm. We find that, with incubation of the embryos at elevated temperature, the frequency of left-right laterality defects is increased drastically in embryos with a low number of DFCs. Furthermore, we observe that these fluctuations have a large stochastic component among fish of the same genetic background. Hence, a stochastic variation in early development leads to a remarkably strong macroscopic phenotype. These fluctuations appear to be associated with maternal effects in the specification of the DFCs.","['Animals', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/*embryology', 'Phenotype', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Fish', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
33454011,The role of Arid4b in mESC lineage commitment,"Distinct cell types emerge from embryonic stem cells through a precise and coordinated execution of gene expression programs during lineage commitment. This is established by the action of lineage specific transcription factors along with chromatin complexes. Numerous studies have focused on epigenetic factors that affect embryonic stem cells (ESC) self-renewal and pluripotency. However, the contribution of chromatin to lineage decisions at the exit from pluripotency has not been as extensively studied. Using a pooled epigenetic shRNA screen strategy, we identified chromatin-related factors critical for differentiation toward mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Here we reveal a critical role for the chromatin protein, ARID4B. Arid4b-deficient mESCs are similar to WT mESCs in the expression of pluripotency factors and their self-renewal. However, ARID4B loss results in defects in up-regulation of the meso/endodermal gene expression program. It was previously shown that Arid4b resides in a complex with SIN3A and HDACS 1 and 2. We identified a physical and functional interaction of ARID4B with HDAC1 rather than HDAC2, suggesting functionally distinct Sin3a subcomplexes might regulate cell fate decisions Finally, we observed that ARID4B deficiency leads to increased H3K27me3 and a reduced H3K27Ac level in key developmental gene loci, whereas a subset of genomic regions gain H3K27Ac marks. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic control through ARID4B plays a key role in the execution of lineage-specific gene expression programs at pluripotency exit.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mesoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex/chemistry/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Proteins', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Keyword', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'protein', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein complex', 'Complex CNV detection']"

Colonization can be asymptomatic, and it is considered not pathogenic. However, it is able to invade lacerated oral mucosa, where it ingests fragments of live cells, suggesting pathogenous potential. Here, we characterized the transcriptomes of gingival cells after infection with <i>E. gingivalis</i> using RNA sequencing and observed pathogen interaction with the epithelial monolayer barrier by scanning electron microscopy. In epithelial and fibroblast cells, strongest differential expression showed gene set ""chemokines and inflammatory molecules in myeloid cells"" (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.9, effect size 5.15, adjusted <i>P</i> = 3.1 × 10<sup>-19</sup>) and ""cell cycle and growth arrest"" (AUC = 0.91, effect size = 4.56, adjusted <i>P</i> = 4.8 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), respectively.

33767446,Neuronal Enhancers are Hotspots for DNA Single-Strand Break Repair [RNA-seq],"Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons<sup>1,2</sup>. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell-type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair.","['5-Methylcytosine/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', '*DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","['DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Single particle analysis', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'pair', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Duplication detection', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'PCR experiment', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
34347114,Gene expression analysis comparing between pure- and mixed type testicular seminoma,"We previously demonstrated a genetic evidence of the progression from seminoma to embryonal carcinoma in mixed testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). This process, the ""reprogramming"" of seminoma cells, is crucial for pathological tumorigenesis and should be kept in mind while designing clinical therapeutic strategies. We hypothesized that a comparison between pure-type seminomas and seminoma components in mixed tumors (mixed-type seminomas) could reveal early changes in the reprogramming process. In the present study, we performed gene expression microarray analysis of six pure-type and six mixed-type seminomas. Hierarchical clustering analysis properly grouped each type of seminomas into a separated cluster. Supervised analysis between pure-type and mixed-type seminomas revealed 154 significantly dysregulated genes (Storey-adjusted q < 0.05). The genes with the highest overexpression in mixed-type seminomas compared with the pure-type seminomas included MT1 isoforms, PRSS8, TSC22D1, and SLC39A4; downregulated genes included DEFB123, LMTK2, and MYRF. Functional annotation analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that the top-ranked functional categories were related to cellular zinc metabolism and consisted of MT1 isoforms and SLC39A4, the results of which were validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis. In conclusion, this research provides further evidence that pure and mixed types of seminomas are molecularly different, which may contribute to elucidate the reprogramming mechanism in the progression of TGCTs.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Complex and Mixed/chemistry/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/chemistry/*genetics/pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminoma/chemistry/*genetics/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics/pathology', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']","['Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'MAT', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
34564690,RNA-seq Analysis of control and CyPA-stimulated BEAs-2B cells Transcriptomes,"SARS-CoV-2 mutations contribute to increased viral transmissibility and immune escape, compromising the effectiveness of existing vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. An in-depth investigation on COVID-19 pathogenesis is urgently needed to develop a strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we identified CD147 as a universal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Meanwhile, Meplazeumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, could block cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants-alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with inhibition rates of 68.7, 75.7, 52.1, 52.1, and 62.3% at 60 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta. When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a ""spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis"": Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway. Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm. Importantly, Meplazumab could effectively inhibit viral entry and inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Therefore, our findings provided a new perspective for severe COVID-19-related pathogenesis. Furthermore, the validated universal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants can be targeted for COVID-19 treatment.","['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Basigin/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'COVID-19/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'SARS-CoV-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vero Cells', '*COVID-19 Drug Treatment']","['Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Drug name', 'Drug identifier', 'Drug report', 'Cytometry', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Kinase name', 'Operating system name', 'Biological system modelling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession']"

33442060,m6A methylation regulates the fate of endogenous retrovirus transcripts [CUT & RUN],"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are abundant and heterogenous groups of integrated retroviral sequences that affect genome regulation and cell physiology throughout their RNA-centred life cycle<sup>1</sup>. Failure to repress ERVs is associated with cancer, infertility, senescence and neurodegenerative diseases<sup>2,3</sup>. Here, using an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen in mouse embryonic stem cells, we identify m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation as a way to restrict ERVs. Methylation of ERV mRNAs is catalysed by the complex of methyltransferase-like METTL3-METTL14<sup>4</sup> proteins, and we found that depletion of METTL3-METTL14, along with their accessory subunits WTAP and ZC3H13, led to increased mRNA abundance of intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) and related ERVK elements specifically, by targeting their 5' untranslated region. Using controlled auxin-dependent degradation of the METTL3-METTL14 enzymatic complex, we showed that IAP mRNA and protein abundance is dynamically and inversely correlated with m<sup>6</sup>A catalysis. By monitoring chromatin states and mRNA stability upon METTL3-METTL14 double depletion, we found that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mainly acts by reducing the half-life of IAP mRNA, and this occurs by the recruitment of the YTHDF family of m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins<sup>5</sup>. Together, our results indicate that RNA methylation provides a protective effect in maintaining cellular integrity by clearing reactive ERV-derived RNA species, which may be especially important when transcriptional silencing is less stringent.","['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle/*genetics', 'Half-Life', '*Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing Factors/metabolism', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'System metadata', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'Article', 'Single particle analysis', 'Article ID', 'Biosciences', 'LSID', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Keyword', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Protein domains', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"

Here, we identify metabolic engineering targets limiting expression of recombinant human proteins through a systems biology analysis of the transcriptomes of CHO and HEK293 during recombinant expression. In an expression comparison of 24 difficult to express proteins, one third of the challenging human proteins displayed improved secretion upon host cell swapping from CHO to HEK293. Guided by a comprehensive transcriptomics comparison between cell lines, especially highlighting differences in secretory pathway utilization, a co-expression screening of 21 secretory pathway components validated ATF4, SRP9, JUN, PDIA3 and HSPA8 as productivity boosters in CHO. Moreover, more heavily glycosylated products benefitted more from the elevated activities of the N- and O-glycosyltransferases found in HEK293. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utilization of HEK293 for expression rescue of human proteins and suggest a methodology for identification of secretory pathway components for metabolic engineering of HEK293 and CHO.","['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Secretory Pathway/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Rice', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Recombination detection', 'Pathway or network', 'Pathway overrepresentation data', 'Pathway ID (Unipathway)']"
34137374,BET family members Bdf1/2 modulate global transcription initiation and elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ChEC-Seq),"Human bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family members are promising targets for therapy of cancer and immunoinflammatory diseases, but their mechanisms of action and functional redundancies are poorly understood. Bdf1/2, yeast homologues of the human BET factors, were previously proposed to target transcription factor TFIID to acetylated histone H4, analogous to bromodomains that are present within the largest subunit of metazoan TFIID. We investigated the genome-wide roles of Bdf1/2 and found that their important contributions to transcription extend beyond TFIID function as transcription of many genes is more sensitive to Bdf1/2 than to TFIID depletion. Bdf1/2 co-occupy the majority of yeast promoters and affect preinitiation complex formation through recruitment of TFIID, Mediator, and basal transcription factors to chromatin. Surprisingly, we discovered that hypersensitivity of genes to Bdf1/2 depletion results from combined defects in transcription initiation and early elongation, a striking functional similarity to human BET proteins, most notably Brd4. Our results establish Bdf1/2 as critical for yeast transcription and provide important mechanistic insights into the function of BET proteins in all eukaryotes.","['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Genome, Fungal/genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription Elongation, Genetic', '*Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription Initiation, Genetic']","['Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Translation initiation site prediction']"

34173975,Bulk RNA-sequencing of fibroblasts isolated by FACS from normal human prostate,"Stromal-epithelial interactions are critical to the morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis of the prostate, but the molecular identity and anatomy of discrete stromal cell types is poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified and validated the in situ localization of three smooth muscle subtypes (prostate smooth muscle, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle) and two novel fibroblast subtypes in human prostate. Peri-epithelial fibroblasts (APOD+) wrap around epithelial structures, whereas interstitial fibroblasts (C7+) are interspersed in extracellular matrix. In contrast, the mouse displayed three fibroblast subtypes with distinct proximal-distal and lobe-specific distribution patterns. Statistical analysis of mouse and human fibroblasts showed transcriptional correlation between mouse prostate (C3+) and urethral (Lgr5+) fibroblasts and the human interstitial fibroblast subtype. Both urethral fibroblasts (Lgr5+) and ductal fibroblasts (Wnt2+) in the mouse contribute to a proximal Wnt/Tgfb signaling niche that is absent in human prostate. Instead, human peri-epithelial fibroblasts express secreted WNT inhibitors SFRPs and DKK1, which could serve as a buffer against stromal WNT ligands by creating a localized signaling niche around individual prostate glands. We also identified proximal-distal fibroblast density differences in human prostate that could amplify stromal signaling around proximal prostate ducts. In human benign prostatic hyperplasia, fibroblast subtypes upregulate critical immunoregulatory pathways and show distinct distributions in stromal and glandular phenotypes. A detailed taxonomy of leukocytes in benign prostatic hyperplasia reveals an influx of myeloid dendritic cells, T cells and B cells, resembling a mucosal inflammatory disorder. A receptor-ligand interaction analysis of all cell types revealed a central role for fibroblasts in growth factor, morphogen, and chemokine signaling to endothelia, epithelia, and leukocytes.

33459422,"RNAseq analysis of genes activated 90 minutes, or 7 days post irradiation or untreated cells with knockdown of NFKBIA","The IκB kinase (IKK)-NF-κB pathway is activated as part of the DNA damage response and controls both inflammation and resistance to apoptosis. How these distinct functions are achieved remained unknown. We demonstrate here that DNA double-strand breaks elicit two subsequent phases of NF-κB activation in vivo and in vitro, which are mechanistically and functionally distinct. RNA-sequencing reveals that the first-phase controls anti-apoptotic gene expression, while the second drives expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes. The rapidly activated first phase is driven by the ATM-PARP1-TRAF6-IKK cascade, which triggers proteasomal destruction of inhibitory IκBα, and is terminated through IκBα re-expression from the NFKBIA gene. The second phase, which is activated days later in senescent cells, is on the other hand independent of IKK and the proteasome. An altered phosphorylation status of NF-κB family member p65/RelA, in part mediated by GSK3β, results in transcriptional silencing of NFKBIA and IKK-independent, constitutive activation of NF-κB in senescence. Collectively, our study reveals a novel physiological mechanism of NF-κB activation with important implications for genotoxic cancer treatment.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/*physiology', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'DNA', 'dna', 'DNA structure', 'pair', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Kinase name', 'GlycoMap ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
33839687,Effect of the CSF1R inhibitor AZD7507 on a relapse mouse model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may stimulate anticancer adaptive immune responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), but little is known about effects on innate immunity. Using omental biopsies from HGSOC, and omental tumors from orthotopic mouse HGSOC models that replicate the human tumor microenvironment, we studied the impact of platinum-based NACT on tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We found that chemotherapy reduces markers associated with alternative macrophage activation while increasing expression of proinflammatory pathways, with evidence of inflammasome activation. Further evidence of a shift in TAM functions came from macrophage depletion via CSF1R inhibitors (CSF1Ri) in the mouse models. Although macrophage depletion in established disease had no impact on tumor weight or survival, CSF1Ri treatment after chemotherapy significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival. This decrease in survival was accompanied by significant inhibition of adaptive immune response pathways in the tumors. We conclude that chemotherapy skews the TAM population in HSGOC toward an antitumor phenotype that may aid adaptive immune responses, and therapies that enhance or sustain this during remission may delay relapse.","['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/drug therapy/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/methods', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology', 'Tumor-Associated Macrophages/*immunology']","['DNA barcoding', 'Peptide immunogenicity data', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Parsing', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Image metadata', 'Rate of association', 'Tumor annotation']"

Eleven patients with primary (n=3) or secondary (n=8) hyperparathyroidism were studied with 99mTc sestamibi parathyroid imaging CT and MR imaging. Images of the neck were acquired at 10 min and 2-3 after tracer injection. The three patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and five patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism underwent parathyroidectomy. The ectopic glands were confirmed by histopathological examination of the resected specimens. In respect of 20 parathyroid glands in the eight patients explored surgically, the sensitivity and specificity of sestamibi imaging were 70% (14/20) and 88%, respectively, those of CT, 40% (8/20) and 88%, and those of MR imaging, 60% (12/20) and 88%. Of these patients, three had parathyroid adenomas while five had hyperplasia (17 glands). Sestamibi imaging localized eight ectopic parathyroid glands, which were surgically confirmed (six were located in the thymus and two in the mediastinum). In one patient explored surgically, the ectopic gland was located outside the field of the MR coil. Although the remaining three cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism were not confirmed surgically, these patients demonstrated sestamibi uptake in five parathyroid glands, including three ectopic glands. MR images demonstrated abnormal parathyroid glands in the same regions as sestamibi imaging. Our data indicate that 99mTc-sestamibi imaging should be used initially to localize the ectopic parathyroid glands in patients with hyperparathyroidism for anatomical guidance prior to MR or CT imaging.","['Choristoma/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Diseases/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Neck', '*Parathyroid Glands/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi', 'Thymus Gland/*diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Secondary structure', 'Secondary structure data', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'MRI', 'MRI image', 'NMR', 'MAT', 'Gene ID (ECK)', 'newick', 'NET', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Sequence position specification', 'ELAND format', 'Tomography', 'Software engineering']"
35325193,Nuclear receptor activation leads to functional changes in CTCF-defined chromatin structure,"Spatial genome organization is tightly controlled by several regulatory mechanisms and is essential for gene expression control. Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate physiological and pathophysiological processes and are primary pharmacological targets. DNA binding of the important loop-forming insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) was modulated by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). We performed CTCF HiChIP assays to produce the first genome-wide dataset of CTCF long-range interactions in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, and to determine whether dynamic changes of spatial chromatin interactions are essential for fine-tuning of nuclear receptor signaling. We detected changes in 3D chromatin organization upon vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation at 3.1% of all observed CTCF interactions. VDR binding was enriched at both differential loop anchors and within differential loops. Differential loops were observed in several putative functional roles including TAD border formation, promoter-enhancer looping, and establishment of VDR-responsive insulated neighborhoods. Vitamin D target genes were enriched in differential loops and at their anchors. Secondary vitamin D effects related to dynamic chromatin domain changes were linked to location of downstream transcription factors in differential loops. CRISPR interference and loop anchor deletion experiments confirmed the functional relevance of nuclear receptor ligand-induced adjustments of the chromatin 3D structure for gene expression regulation.","['*Chromatin/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Ligands', '*Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/metabolism/pharmacology']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"

32483258,Skeletal muscle enhancer interactions identify genes controlling whole body metabolism in humans,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are metabolic disorders influenced by lifestyle and genetic factors that are characterized by insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, a prominent site of glucose disposal. Numerous genetic variants have been associated with obesity and T2D, of which the majority are located in non-coding DNA regions. This suggests that most variants mediate their effect by altering the activity of gene-regulatory elements, including enhancers. Here, we map skeletal muscle genomic enhancer elements that are dynamically regulated after exposure to the free fatty acid palmitate or the inflammatory cytokine TNFα. By overlapping enhancer positions with the location of disease-associated genetic variants, and resolving long-range chromatin interactions between enhancers and gene promoters, we identify target genes involved in metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle. The majority of these genes also associate with altered whole-body metabolic phenotypes in the murine BXD genetic reference population. Thus, our combined genomic investigations identified genes that are involved in skeletal muscle metabolism.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Palmitic Acid/pharmacology', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Cell type accession', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Histogram', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide annotation', 'Peptide identification', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Tumor annotation', 'Transcription factor name']"

Here we show that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> amplification and MEKi resistance are reversible following drug withdrawal.

34075163,Dynamic patterns of DNA methylation in the normal prostate epithelial differentiation program are targets of aberrant methylation in prostate cancer [Methyl Capture],"Understanding the epigenetic control of normal differentiation programs might yield principal information about critical regulatory states that are disturbed in cancer. We utilized the established non-malignant HPr1-AR prostate epithelial cell model that upon androgen exposure commits to a luminal cell differentiation trajectory from that of a basal-like state. We profile the dynamic transcriptome associated with this transition at multiple time points (0 h, 1 h, 24 h, 96 h), and confirm that expression patterns are strongly indicative of a progressive basal to luminal cell differentiation program based on human expression signatures. Furthermore, we establish dynamic patterns of DNA methylation associated with this program by use of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Expression patterns associated with androgen induced luminal cell differentiation were found to have significantly elevated DNA methylation dynamics. Shifts in methylation profiles were strongly associated with Polycomb repressed regions and to promoters associated with bivalency, and strongly enriched for binding motifs of AR and MYC. Importantly, we found that dynamic DNA methylation patterns observed in the normal luminal cell differentiation program were significant targets of aberrant methylation in prostate cancer. These findings suggest that the normal dynamics of DNA methylation in luminal differentiation contribute to the aberrant methylation patterns in prostate cancer.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Prostate/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Date', 'Prosite accession number', 'Prosite protein pattern']"
34162701,Immune profiles of early onset vs late onset colorectal cancer,"Despite a decrease in the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) over the last 40 y, the prevalence of CRC in people under 50 y old is increasing around the globe. Early onset (≤50 y old) and late onset (≥65 y old) CRC appear to have differences in their clinicopathological and genetic features, but it is unclear if there are differences in the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that the immune microenvironment of early onset CRC is distinct from late onset CRC and promotes tumor progression. We used NanoString immune profiling to analyze mRNA expression of immune genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from patients with early (<i>n</i> = 40) and late onset (<i>n</i> = 39) CRC. We found three genes, SAA1, C7, and CFD, have increased expression in early onset CRC and distinct immune signatures based on the tumor location. After adjusting for clinicopathological features, increased expression of CFD and SAA1 were associated with worse progression-free survival, and increased expression of C7 was associated with worse overall survival. We also performed gain-of-function experiments with CFD and SAA1 in s.c. tumor models and found that CFD is associated with higher tumor volumes, impacted several immune genes, and impacted three genes in mice that were also found to be differentially expressed in early onset CRC (EGR1, PSMB9, and CXCL9). Our data demonstrate that the immune microenvironment, characterized by a distinct innate immune response signature in early onset CRC, is unique, location dependent, and might contribute to worse outcomes.","['Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Complement C7/genetics', 'Complement Factor D/genetics', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology']","['Sequence offset', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Color', 'Reverse complement', 'Complementary medicine', 'Protein complex', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Topic', 'Tool topic', 'Data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'MAT', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Text', 'Protein expression', 'protein', 'Protein sequence', 'Protein data', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways']"
34051058,Gene expression profiles of breast cancer metastasis according to organ site,"In advanced breast cancer, biomarker identification and patient selection using a metastatic tumor biopsy is becoming more necessary. However, the biology of metastasis according to the organ site is largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression of 771 genes in 184 metastatic samples across 11 organs, including liver, lung, brain, and bone, and made the following observations. First, all PAM50 molecular intrinsic subtypes were represented across organs and within immunohistochemistry-based groups. Second, HER2-low disease was identified across all organ sites, including bone, and HER2 expression significantly correlated with ERBB2 expression. Third, the majority of expression variation was explained by intrinsic subtype and not organ of metastasis. Fourth, subtypes and individual subtype-related genes/signatures were significantly associated with overall survival. Fifth, we identified 74 genes whose expression was organ-specific and subtype-independent. Finally, immune profiles were found more expressed in lung compared to brain or liver metastasis. Our results suggest that relevant tumor biology can be captured in metastatic tissues across a variety of organ sites; however, unique biological features according to organ site were also identified and future studies should explore their implications in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', '*Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/genetics']","['Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'BEAST', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Here, using genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MSUc alone induce a metabolic-inflammatory transcriptional program in non-primed human and murine macrophages that is markedly distinct to that induced by LPS. Genes uniquely upregulated in response to MSUc belong to lipid and amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, and SLC transporters. This upregulation leads to a metabolic rewiring in sera from individuals and mice with acute gouty arthritis. Mechanistically, the initiating inflammatory-metabolic changes in acute gout flares are regulated through a persistent expression and increased binding of JUN to the promoter of target genes through JNK signaling-but not P38-in a process that is different than after LPS stimulation and independent of inflammasome activation. Finally, pharmacological JNK inhibition limits MSUc-induced inflammation in animal models of acute gouty inflammation.","['Animals', '*Arthritis, Gouty/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Uric Acid/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Nucleic acid data', 'URI']"
30760540,Molothrus aeneus Raw sequence reads,"Parental care is critical for offspring survival in many species. However, parental behaviors have been lost in roughly 1% of avian species known as the obligate brood parasites. To shed light on molecular and neurobiological mechanisms mediating brood parasitic behavior, we compared brain gene expression patterns between two brood parasitic species and one closely related non-parasitic Icterid (blackbird) species. Our analyses focused on gene expression changes specifically in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region known to play a critical role in parental behavior across vertebrates. Using comparative transcriptomic approaches, we identified gene expression patterns associated with brood parasitism. We evaluated three non-mutually exclusive alternatives for the evolution of brood parasitism: (1) retention of juvenile-like (neotenic) gene expression, (2) reduced expression of maternal care-related genes in the POA, and/or (3) increased expression of genes inhibiting maternal care. We find evidence for neotenic expression patterns in both species of parasitic cowbirds as compared to maternal, non-parasites. In addition, we observed differential expression in a number of genes with previously established roles in mediating maternal care. Together, these results provide the first insight into transcriptomic and genetic mechanisms underlying the loss of maternal behavior in avian brood parasites.","['Acetylcholinesterase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Behavior, Animal', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Maternal Behavior', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Passeriformes/genetics/*physiology', 'Preoptic Area/metabolism', 'Receptors, Bombesin/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prolactin/metabolism', 'Somatostatin/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'MAT', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name']"

12075352,Global analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans operons,"The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and its relatives are unique among animals in having operons. Operons are regulated multigene transcription units, in which polycistronic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA coding for multiple peptides) is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. This occurs by 3' end formation and trans-splicing using the specialized SL2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle for downstream mRNAs. Previously, the correlation between downstream location in an operon and SL2 trans-splicing has been strong, but anecdotal. Although only 28 operons have been reported, the complete sequence of the C. elegans genome reveals numerous gene clusters. To determine how many of these clusters represent operons, we probed full-genome microarrays for SL2-containing mRNAs. We found significant enrichment for about 1,200 genes, including most of a group of several hundred genes represented by complementary DNAs that contain SL2 sequence. Analysis of their genomic arrangements indicates that >90% are downstream genes, falling in 790 distinct operons. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.

16079153,Comparison of gene expression in FGFR1 heterozygous and null E12.5 murine telencephalons,"Recent findings support a model for neocortical area formation in which neocortical progenitor cells become patterned by extracellular signals to generate a protomap of progenitor cell areas that in turn generate area-specific neurons. The protomap is thought to be underpinned by spatial differences in progenitor cell identity that are reflected at the transcriptional level. We systematically investigated the nature and composition of the protomap by genomic analyses of spatial and temporal neocortical progenitor cell gene expression. We did not find gene expression evidence for progenitor cell organisation into domains or compartments, instead finding rostrocaudal gradients of gene expression across the entire neocortex. Given the role of Fgf signalling in rostrocaudal neocortical patterning, we carried out an in vivo global analysis of cortical gene expression in Fgfr1 mutant mice, identifying consistent alterations in the expression of candidate protomap elements. One such gene, Mest, was predicted by those studies to be a direct target of Fgf8 signalling and to be involved in setting up, rather than implementing, the progenitor cell protomap. In support of this, we confirmed Mest as a direct transcriptional target of Fgf8-regulated signalling in vitro. Functional studies demonstrated that this gene has a role in establishing patterned gene expression in the developing neocortex, potentially by acting as a negative regulator of the Fgf8-controlled patterning system.","['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Neocortex/abnormalities/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Prosite protein pattern', 'EMBOSS sequence pattern', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'latex', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"

However, a comprehensive view of the regulatory pathways induced by this compound has not yet been elaborated. Fischer F344 rats were gavaged daily for 5 days with vehicle or D3T (0.3 mmol/kg). The global changes of gene expression in liver were measured with Affymetrix RG-U34A chips. With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the significance of the impact of D3T treatment. Two unexpected functional classes were identified for the D3T treatment, cytosolic ribosome constituents with 90% of those genes increased, and cholesterol biosynthesis with 91% of the genes repressed. In another novel approach, the differentially expressed genes were evaluated by the Ingenuity computational pathway analysis tool to identify specific regulatory networks and canonical pathways responsive to D3T treatment. In addition to the known glutathione metabolism pathway (P = 0.0011), several other significant pathways were also revealed, including antigen presentation (P = 0.000476), androgen/estrogen biosynthesis (P = 0.000551), fatty acid (P = 0.000216), and tryptophan metabolism (P = 0.000331) pathways. These findings showed a profound impact of D3T on lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive response, indicating a broader cytoprotective effect of this compound than previously expected.","['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects/genetics', 'Glutathione/genetics', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ribosomes/genetics', 'Thiones/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tryptophan/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Over-representation data', 'Analysis', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene cluster', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'MAT', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Chromosomes', 'Phenotype name', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
11238562,H. pylori strain comparisons,"Helicobacter pylori enhances the risk for ulcer disease and gastric cancer, yet only a minority of H. pylori-colonized individuals develop disease. We examined the ability of two H. pylori isolates to induce differential host responses in vivo or in vitro, and then used an H. pylori whole genome microarray to identify bacterial determinants related to pathogenesis. Gastric ulcer strain B128 induced more severe gastritis, proliferation, and apoptosis in gerbil mucosa than did duodenal ulcer strain G1.1, and gastric ulceration and atrophy occurred only in B128+ gerbils. In vitro, gerbil-passaged B128 derivatives significantly increased IL-8 secretion and apoptosis compared with G1.1 strains. DNA hybridization to the microarray identified several strain-specific differences in gene composition including a large deletion of the cag pathogenicity island in strain G1.1. Partial and complete disruption of the cag island in strain B128 attenuated induction of IL-8 in vitro and significantly decreased gastric inflammation in vivo. These results indicate that the ability of H. pylori to regulate epithelial cell responses related to inflammation depends on the presence of an intact cag pathogenicity island. Use of an H pylori whole genome microarray is an effective method to identify differences in gene content between H. pylori strains that induce distinct pathological outcomes in a rodent model of H. pylori infection.","['Animals', '*Antigens, Bacterial', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Duodenal Ulcer/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Gastritis/etiology/metabolism', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Gerbillinae', 'Helicobacter Infections/metabolism/*pathology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stomach Ulcer/metabolism/*pathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Nutritional science', 'Gastroenterology', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Protein interactions', 'Infectious disease', 'Helical net', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Sequence', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map']"

16762835,Pol III transcription machinery occupancy monitoring upon rapamycin treatment,"We report genome-wide analyses that establish Maf1 as a general and direct repressor of yeast RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to microarray hybridization experiments showed an increased association of Maf1 to Pol III-transcribed genes under repressing condition (rapamycin treatment) correlated with a dissociation of Brf1 and Pol III. Maf1 can exist in various phosphorylation states and interacts with Pol III in a dephosphorylated state. The largest subunit of Pol III, C160, was identified as a target of Maf1. Under repressing conditions, Maf1 is dephosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus, and Pol III-Maf1 interaction increases. Mutations in protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit-encoding genes prevented rapamycin-induced Maf1 dephosphorylation, its nuclear accumulation, and repression of Pol III transcription. The results indicate that Pol III transcription can be globally and rapidly downregulated via dephosphorylation and relocation of a general negative cofactor.","['Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Repression/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase III/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor TFIIIB/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme report', 'Gene expression', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'PTM localisation', 'Expression signals', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein databases', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Proteins', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Protein accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Virology', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

We show that the Aft1p binding region of the FET3 promoter or the Mac1p binding region of the CTR1 promoter is necessary and sufficient to mediate heme-deficient repression. Transcription is repressed in the absence of heme, and a genetic screen identified Tup1p and Hda1p as being required for transcriptional repression. In contrast to FET3 and CTR1, Aft1p target genes ARN1 and FIT1 are transcribed in the absence of heme. A 14 bp sequence in the ARN1 promoter is necessary and sufficient to permit transcription in the absence of heme. Transcription in the absence of heme required the presence of Cti6p to overcome the effect of Tup1p, and Cti6p was recruited to the ARN1 promoter in the absence of heme. We hypothesize that transcription of the siderophore transporter ARN1 permits yeast to accumulate iron in the absence of oxygen and to deny iron to competing organisms.","['Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Siderophores/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Operon', 'MRI', 'GEN', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein report', 'Protein expression', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Protein accession', 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

16473883,Interferon-gamma timecourse in IFNg-/- and SOCS1-/-IFNg-/- mouse livers,"Negative feedback is a mechanism commonly employed in biological processes as a means of maintaining homeostasis. We have investigated the roles of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins in regulating the kinetics of negative feedback in response to cytokine signaling. In mouse livers and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) rapidly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3. STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was bi-phasic in response to continuous IL-6 signaling. In macrophages lacking Socs3, however, continuous IL-6 signaling induced uniformly high levels of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, and early IL-6-inducible genes were inappropriately expressed at intermediate time points. SOCS3 therefore imposes bi-phasic kinetics upon IL-6 signaling. Compared with Socs3 mRNA, Socs1 mRNA was induced relatively slowly, and SOCS1 simply attenuated the duration of IFNgamma signaling. Surprisingly, heightened Socs1 mRNA expression but minimal STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed after prolonged stimulation with IFNgamma, indicating that STAT1 may not play a large role in inducing Socs1 mRNA during steady-state IFNgamma signaling. We also demonstrate that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can desensitize primary bone marrow-derived macrophages to IFNgamma and IL-6 signaling, respectively. Consistent with the kinetics with which Socs1 and Socs3 mRNAs were induced, SOCS3 desensitized cells to IL-6 rapidly, whereas SOCS1-mediated desensitization to IFNgamma occurred at later time points. The kinetics with which SOCS proteins are induced by cytokine may therefore be a parameter that is ""hard-wired"" into specific cytokine signaling pathways as a means of tailoring the kinetics with which cells become desensitized.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'cel', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Analysis', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene cluster', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'DNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Genetics', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Reaction data', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Protein report', 'Transcription', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein signature', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Prosite accession number']"
17166692,The Influence of Human Respiratory Epithelia on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gene Expression,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause acute or chronic infections in humans. Little is known about the initial adaptation of P. aeruginosa to host tissues and the factors that determine whether a P. aeruginosa-epithelial cell interaction will manifest as an acute or a chronic infection. To gain insights into the initial phases of P. aeruginosa infections and to identify P. aeruginosa genes regulated in response to respiratory epithelia, we exposed P. aeruginosa to cultured primary differentiated human airway epithelia. We used a P. aeruginosa strain that causes acute damage to the epithelia and a mutant with defects in Type III secretion and in rhamnolipid synthesis. The mutant did not cause rapid damage to epithelia as did the wildtype. We compared the transcriptomes of the P. aeruginosa wildtype and the mutant to each other and to P. aeruginosa grown under other conditions, and we discovered overlapping sets of differentially expressed genes in the wildtype and mutant exposed to epithelia. A recent study reported that exposure of P. aeruginosa to epithelia is characterized by a repression of the bacterial iron-responsive genes. These findings were suggestive of ample iron availability during infection. In contrast, we found that P. aeruginosa shows an iron-starvation response upon exposure to epithelial cells. This observation highlights the importance of the iron starvation response in both acute and chronic infections and suggests opportunities for therapy.","['Acute Disease', 'Chronic Disease', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Glycolipids/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*microbiology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Respiratory Mucosa/cytology/*microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virulence Factors/genetics']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'geneseq', 'Training material', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Lipids', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Infectious disease', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Virulence prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Virus identifier']"

16868073,The kidney collecting duct acid-base regulon,"Kidneys are essential for acid-base homeostasis, especially when organisms cope with changes in acid or base dietary intake. Because collecting ducts constitute the final site for regulating urine acid-base balance, we undertook to identify the gene network involved in acid-base transport and regulation in the mouse outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD). For this purpose, we combined kidney functional studies and quantitative analysis of gene expression in OMCDs, by transcriptome and candidate gene approaches, during metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, to better delineate the set of genes concerned with acid-base disturbance, the OMCD transcriptome of acidotic mice was compared with that of both normal mice and mice undergoing an adaptative response through potassium depletion. Metabolic acidosis, achieved through an NH4Cl-supplemented diet for 3 days, not only induced acid secretion but also stimulated the aldosterone and vasopressin systems and triggered cell proliferation. Accordingly, metabolic acidosis increased the expression of genes involved in acid-base transport, sodium transport, water transport, and cell proliferation. In particular, >25 transcripts encoding proteins involved in urine acidification (subunits of H-ATPase, kidney anion exchanger, chloride channel Clcka, carbonic anhydrase-2, aldolase) were co-regulated during acidosis. These transcripts, which cooperate to achieve a similar function and are co-regulated during acidosis, constitute a functional unit that we propose to call a ""regulon"".","['Acid-Base Equilibrium/*genetics', 'Acidosis, Renal Tubular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antiporters/genetics', 'Carbonic Anhydrase II/genetics', 'Chloride Channels/genetics', 'Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kidney Tubules, Collecting/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics', 'Regulon']","['Linkage disequilibrium calculation', 'Linkage disequilibrium (report)', 'Nucleic acid analysis', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Promoters', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate report', 'CHAIN', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Data acquisition', 'Sample collections', 'Microbial collection', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'DNA translation', 'Translation phase specification', 'Translation frame specification', 'Sequence feature ID (SwissRegulon)']"
17264241,Pre- and postnatal hepatic expression profiles of two pig breeds differing in body composition,"The liver plays a central role in the regulation of the metabolic status, partitioning of nutrients, and expenditure of energy. To gain insight into hepatic metabolic pathways and key transcripts affecting traits related to body composition, liver expression profiles were compared of pigs of two breeds, the obese German Landrace (DL) and the lean Pietrain (Pi). Porcine oligonucleotide microarray were hybridized with liver cRNAs obtained at peripubertal age (180 days of age) and prenatal stages (35, 63, and 91 days postconception) that represent three developmental stages of liver, i.e., period of differentiation, period of metabolic activity, and period of glycogen accumulation. In terms of the number of genes regulated between DL and Pi, the most striking distinctions were found at peripubertal age with upregulation of key genes of lipid metabolism pathways (FASN, ACSS2, ACACA) in obese DL pigs and upregulation of genes of cell growth and/or maintenance, and protein syntheses, as well as cell proliferation pathways (PPARD, POU1F1, IGF2R), in lean Pi pigs. Moreover, time course analysis of breed-dependent expression profiles revealed breed-typical temporal regulation from prenatal stages to peripubertal age of genes assigned to biological processes involving lipid pathways and cell activity, i.e., breed differences are already initiated during early prenatal development.

Using transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that there was little difference in the ultrastructure of Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula obtained by the two methods. However, significant differences in gene expression profiles were apparent when we used an oligonucleotide microarray to compare the gene expression profiles of schistosomula obtained in vivo from lung tissue with those maintained in vitro, and with adult worms of S. japonicum. It is likely that host environmental factors, which cannot be reliably reproduced in vitro, do influence the growth, development and overall biology of schistosomes.

17096596,Expression Profiling of MAP Kinase-Mediated Meiotic Progression in C. elegans,"The LET-60 (Ras)/LIN-45 (Raf)/MPK-1 (MAP kinase) signaling pathway plays a key role in the development of multiple tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. For the most part, the identities of the downstream genes that act as the ultimate effectors of MPK-1 signaling have remained elusive. A unique allele of mpk-1, ga111, displays a reversible, temperature-sensitive, tissue-specific defect in progression through meiotic prophase I. We performed gene expression profiling on mpk-1(ga111) animals to identify candidate downstream effectors of MPK-1 signaling in the germ line. This analysis delineated a cohort of genes whose expression requires MPK-1 signaling in germ cells in the pachytene stage of meiosis I. RNA in situ hybridization analysis shows that these genes are expressed in the germ line in an MPK-1-dependent manner and have a spatial expression pattern consistent with the location of activated MPK-1. We found that one MPK-1 signaling-responsive gene encoding a C2H2 zinc finger protein plays a role in meiotic chromosome segregation downstream of MPK-1. Additionally, discovery of genes responsive to MPK-1 signaling permitted us to order MPK-1 signaling relative to several events occurring in pachytene, including EFL-1/DPL-1 gene regulation and X chromosome reactivation.

12750471,Genomewide demarcation of RNA PolII transcription units by physical fractionation of chromatin- Intergenic enrichment,"Epigenetic modifications of chromatin serve an important role in regulating the expression and accessibility of genomic DNA. We report here a genomewide approach for fractionating yeast chromatin into two functionally distinct parts, one containing RNA polymerase II transcribed sequences, and the other comprising noncoding sequences and genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III. Noncoding regions could be further fractionated into promoters and segments lacking promoters. The observed separations were apparently based on differential crosslinking efficiency of chromatin in different genomic regions. The results reveal a genomewide molecular mechanism for marking promoters and genomic regions that have a license to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II, a previously unrecognized level of genomic complexity that may exist in all eukaryotes. Our approach has broad potential use as a tool for genome annotation and for the characterization of global changes in chromatin structure that accompany different genetic, environmental, and disease states.","['DNA Primers', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'Threading', 'Protein threading', 'Open science', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
18189245,gene profiling in carcinoma cell during EMT,"During epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epithelial cells are converted into isolated motile and invasive mesenchymal cells. In model systems, EMT is induced most often by the activation of tyrosine kinase receptors through signaling pathways involving translational and post-translational regulation. In this study, we have used the NBT-II bladder carcinoma cell system to investigate in vitro Fibroblast Growth Factor-1 (FGF-1)-induced EMT. Transcriptome analyses were performed on NBT-II cells stimulated for 2, 6, 24, and 48 h with FGF-1. As some phenotypic changes occurred around 6 h post-stimulation, a supervised analysis was designed to identify transcript variations across defined time-periods. Our results clearly indicate that immediately after FGF-1 stimulation a set of genes assigned to transcriptional regulation (e.g., jun-B and v-ets) and to EMT induction (e.g., Notch 1) is transiently up-regulated. A set of genes involved in proteolytic systems (e.g., MMP-13 and uPAR) is immediately up-regulated but subsequently maintained throughout FGF-1 stimulation. Then follows a second wave of gene expression that includes a strong but transient up-regulation of ephrin B1 and arginase I. Finally, a third group of genes is stably modulated over 48 h which consists primarily of down-regulated genes specifically associated with the EMT-based loss of the epithelial phenotype and maintenance of the mesenchymal and invasive phenotype of carcinoma cells. Using genome-wide oligoarray technology, we have identified novel expressions of immediate, immediate-early and later EMT biomarkers that are specifically activated downstream of the FGF/FGFR pathway and which might be significant prognostic factors for tumor progression of carcinoma.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epithelium/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mesoderm/*metabolism', 'Models, Statistical', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Statistical modelling', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Binary format']"

To rectify this, we have developed a DNA microarray that contains probes for most predicted human OR loci and used that array to examine OR gene expression profiles in olfactory epithelium tissues from three individuals.","['Choristoma', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Olfactory Mucosa', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pseudogenes', 'Receptors, Odorant/*genetics']","['Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Locus ID (PseudoCAP)', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"
17660562,The PI3K domain of Tra1 is required for transcriptional regulation,"Tra1 is an essential component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA and NuA4 complexes. Using targeted mutagenesis, we identified residues within its C-terminal phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) domain that are required for function. The phenotypes of tra1-P3408A, S3463A, and SRR3413-3415AAA included temperature sensitivity and reduced growth in media containing 6% ethanol or calcofluor white or depleted of phosphate. These alleles resulted in a twofold or greater change in expression of approximately 7% of yeast genes in rich media and reduced activation of PHO5 and ADH2 promoters. Tra1-SRR3413 associated with components of both the NuA4 and SAGA complexes and with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain similar to wild-type protein. Tra1-SRR3413 was recruited to the PHO5 promoter in vivo but gave rise to decreased relative amounts of acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 at SAGA and NuA4 regulated promoters. Distinct from other components of these complexes, tra1-SRR3413 resulted in generation-dependent telomere shortening and synthetic slow growth in combination with deletions of a number of genes with roles in membrane-related processes. While the tra1 alleles have some phenotypic similarities with deletions of SAGA and NuA4 components, their distinct nature may arise from the simultaneous alteration of SAGA and NuA4 functions.","['Alleles', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/physiology', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Kinase name', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Beta diversity data']"

Previously, we have identified global gene expression profiles in genital-derived fibroblasts that differ between 46, XY males and 46, XY females with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) due to inactivating mutations of the androgen receptor (AR). While these differences could be due to cell autonomous changes in gene expression induced by androgen programming, recent work suggests they could also be influenced by the location from which the fibroblasts were harvested (topology). To minimize the influence of topology, we compared gene expression patterns of fibroblasts derived from identical urogenital anlagen: the scrotum in normally virilized 46, XY males and the labia majora from completely feminized 46, XY individuals with CAIS.","['Androgens/*physiology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genitalia, Male/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']","['Pathogens', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Dendrogram visualisation', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
17660535,Microarray expression profiling of discrete microdissected mouse inner ear tissues from E9 to E15 at half-day intervals.,"We describe the most comprehensive study to date on gene expression during mouse inner ear (IE) organogenesis. Samples were microdissected from mouse embryos at E9-E15 in half-day intervals, a period that spans all of IE organogenesis. These included separate dissections of all discernible IE substructures such as the cochlea, utricle, and saccule. All samples were analyzed on high density expression microarrays under strict statistical filters. Extensive confirmatory tests were performed, including RNA in situ hybridizations. More than 5000 genes significantly varied in expression according to developmental stage, tissue, or both and defined 28 distinct expression patterns. For example, upregulation of 315 genes provided a clear-cut ""signature"" of early events in IE specification. Additional, clear-cut, gene expression signatures marked specific structures such as the cochlea, utricle, or saccule throughout late IE development. Pathway analysis identified 53 signaling cascades enriched within the 28 patterns. Many novel pathways, not previously implicated in IE development, including beta-adrenergic, amyloid, estrogen receptor, circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways, were identified. Finally, we identified positional candidate genes in 54 uncloned nonsyndromic human deafness intervals. This detailed analysis provides many new insights into the spatial and temporal genetic specification of this complex organ system.","['Animals', 'Ear, Inner/*embryology/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Organogenesis', 'RNA Probes', '*Signal Transduction', '*Systems Biology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetic organisation', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Probes and primers', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Systems biology', 'Biology', 'Biological system modelling']"

31134059,Microbiota-driven regulation in small intestinal epithelial cells [RNA-seq],"Numerous bacterial pathogens infect the mammalian host by initially associating with epithelial cells that line the intestinal lumen. Recent work has revealed that commensal bacteria that reside in the intestine promote defense against pathogenic infection, however whether the microbiota direct host pathways that alter pathogen adherence is not well-understood. Here, by comparing germ-free mice, we identify that the microbiota decrease bacterial pathogen adherence and dampen epithelial expression of the cell surface glycoprotein C-type lectin 2e (Clec2e). Functional studies revealed that overexpression of this lectin promotes adherence of intestinal bacterial pathogens to mammalian cells. Interestingly, microbiota-sensitive downregulation of Clec2e corresponds with decreased histone acetylation of the Clec2e gene in intestinal epithelial cells. Histone deacetylation and transcriptional regulation of Clec2e depends on expression and recruitment of the histone deacetylase HDAC3. Thus, commensal bacteria epigenetically instruct epithelial cells to decrease expression of a C-type lectin that promotes pathogen adherence, revealing a novel mechanism for how the microbiota promote innate defense against infection.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion/*physiology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestines/cytology/*microbiology', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microbiota/*physiology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'cel', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Model organisms', 'Species name', 'Pathogens']"

Reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) generated by contracting skeletal muscle are necessary for optimal protein function, signaling, and adaptation. To investigate the redox proteome of aging gastrocnemius muscles from adult and old male mice, we developed a label-free quantitative proteomic approach that includes a differential cysteine labeling step. The approach allows simultaneous identification of up- and downregulated proteins between samples in addition to the identification and relative quantification of the reversible oxidation state of susceptible redox cysteine residues. Results from muscles of adult and old mice indicate significant changes in the content of chaperone, glucose metabolism, and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, including Protein DJ-1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II, 78 kDa glucose regulated protein, and a reduction in the number of redox-responsive proteins identified in muscle of old mice. Results demonstrate skeletal muscle aging causes a reduction in redox-sensitive proteins involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism, indicating a loss in the flexibility of the redox energy response.

In a second experiment blood donations of three donors were split again in four fractions and one was treated with 20 µM of ADP and the second and third with 20 µM of ADP for 30 s and subsequently with 2 nM of Iloprost for further 30 s and 60 s.","Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) enhances platelet activation by virtually any other stimulant to complete aggregation. It binds specifically to the G-protein-coupled membrane receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12, stimulating intracellular signaling cascades, leading to integrin αIIbβ3 activation, a process antagonized by endothelial prostacyclin. P2Y12 inhibitors are among the most successful antiplatelet drugs, however, show remarkable variability in efficacy. We reasoned whether a more detailed molecular understanding of ADP-induced protein phosphorylation could identify (1) critical hubs in platelet signaling toward aggregation and (2) novel molecular targets for antiplatelet treatment strategies. We applied quantitative temporal phosphoproteomics to study ADP-mediated signaling at unprecedented molecular resolution. Furthermore, to mimic the antagonistic efficacy of endothelial-derived prostacyclin, we determined how Iloprost reverses ADP-mediated signaling events. We provide temporal profiles of 4797 phosphopeptides, 608 of which showed significant regulation. Regulated proteins are implicated in well-known activating functions such as degranulation and cytoskeletal reorganization, but also in less well-understood pathways, involving ubiquitin ligases and GTPase exchange factors/GTPase-activating proteins (GEF/GAP). Our data demonstrate that ADP-triggered phosphorylation occurs predominantly within the first 10 seconds, with many short rather than sustained changes. For a set of phosphorylation sites (eg, PDE3A<sup>Ser312</sup>, CALDAG-GEFI<sup>Ser587</sup>, ENSA<sup>Ser109</sup>), we demonstrate an inverse regulation by ADP and Iloprost, suggesting that these are central modulators of platelet homeostasis.

16940433,Timecourse of in vitro erythroid differentiation of human adult-derived peripheral blood CD34+ cells,"Deciphering the molecular basis for human erythropoiesis should yield information benefiting studies of the hemoglobinopathies and other erythroid disorders. We used an in vitro erythroid differentiation system to study the developing red blood cell transcriptome derived from adult CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. mRNA expression profiling was used to characterize developing erythroid cells at six time points during differentiation (days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). Eleven thousand seven hundred sixty-three genes (20,963 Affymetrix probe sets) were expressed on day 1, and 1,504 genes, represented by 1,953 probe sets, were differentially expressed (DE) with 537 upregulated and 969 downregulated. A subset of the DE genes was validated using real-time RT-PCR. The DE probe sets were subjected to a cluster metric and could be divided into two, three, four, five, or six clusters of genes with different expression patterns in each cluster. Genes in these clusters were examined for shared transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in their promoters by comparing enrichment of each TFBS relative to a reference set using transcriptional regulatory network analysis. The sets of TFBS enriched in genes up- and downregulated during erythropoiesis were distinct. This analysis identified transcriptional regulators critical to erythroid development, factors recently found to play a role, as well as a new list of potential candidates, including Evi-1, a potential silencer of genes upregulated during erythropoiesis. Thus this transcriptional regulatory network analysis has yielded a focused set of factors and their target genes whose role in differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cell into distinct blood cell lineages can be elucidated.","['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Global alignment', 'Proteins', 'Protein globularity', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'protein', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

15656970,toc90_vs_WT,"Post-endosymbiotic evolution of the proto-chloroplast was characterized by gene transfer to the nucleus. Hence, most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and the regulation of chloroplast functions includes nuclear transcriptional control. The expression profiles of 3292 nuclear Arabidopsis genes, most of them encoding chloroplast proteins, were determined from 101 different conditions and have been deposited at the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/geo/) under . The 1590 most-regulated genes fell into 23 distinct groups of co-regulated genes (regulons). Genes of some regulons are not evenly distributed among the five Arabidopsis chromosomes and pairs of adjacent, co-expressed genes exist. Except regulons 1 and 2, regulons are heterogeneous and consist of genes coding for proteins with different subcellular locations or contributing to several biochemical functions. This implies that different organelles and/or metabolic pathways are co-ordinated at the nuclear transcriptional level, and a prototype for this is regulon 12 which contains genes with functions in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as genes associated with transport or transcription. The co-expression of nuclear genes coding for subunits of the photosystems or encoding proteins involved in the transcription/translation of plastome genes (particularly ribosome polypeptides) (regulons 1 and 2, respectively) implies the existence of a novel mechanism that co-ordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression and involves nuclear control of plastid ribosome abundance. The co-regulation of genes for photosystem and plastid ribosome proteins escapes a previously described general control of nuclear chloroplast proteins imposed by a transcriptional master switch, highlighting a mode of transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis which is different compared to other chloroplast functions.

Determination of those transcripts expressed specifically by germ cells should provide an inclusive list of probable critical proteins. Here, total mouse testis transcript profiles were trimmed of transcripts found in cultures enriched in Sertoli or interstitial cells to yield a germ cell-enriched transcript profile. Monitoring of changes of this profile in the developing testis identified 1,652 genes whose transcript abundance increased markedly coincident with the onset of meiosis. Remarkably, 351 of these genes (approximately equal to 20%) appear to be expressed only in the male germline. Germ cell-specific transcripts are much less common earlier in testis development. Further analysis of the UniGene EST database coupled with quantitative PCR indicates that approximately 4% of the mouse genome is dedicated to expression in postmeiotic male germ cells. Most or many of the protein products of these transcripts are probably retained in mature spermatozoa. Targeted disruption of 19 of these genes has indicated that a majority have roles critical for normal fertility.

Finally, relative quantification of membrane proteins between Gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive lung cancer cell lines revealed several up-regulated membrane proteins with key roles in lung cancer progression.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lung Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Time Factors']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Selection detection', 'Format detection', 'Deletion detection', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
25915775,"Very limited information about the post-implantatory effects of vitrification has been published till now. In a previous study, we observed that vitrification procedure introduced transcriptomic and proteomic modifications in the rabbit foetal placenta at the middle of gestation. In addition, a reduction in maternal placenta and foetal weight was also detected. In order to know if these alterations were temporary or not, the aim of the current study was to analyse the proteomic profile of rabbit foetal placenta at two different times of gestation: Day 14 and Day 24. We performed a comparative 2D-DIGE analysis and found that placentas from vitrified embryos expressed eleven different proteins at Day 14 and thirteen at Day 24. The alteration of serum albumin, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 [NADP+] and phosphoglycerate mutase 1 were maintained both Day 14 and Day 24. Our results demonstrate that vitrification is not neutral, and induce a substantial alteration of placental protein expression, even at the end of gestation. But, apart from short-term effects observed on embryos, could vitrification entail long-term consequences in those foetuses that are going to be born? Further studies will determine if alterations observed could be the set point of future modifications to manifest into adulthood","Very limited information on the post-implantatory effects of vitrification has been published till now. We observed in a previous study that the vitrification procedure for the cryopreservation of embryos introduced transcriptomic and proteomic modifications in the rabbit foetal placenta at the middle of gestation. Now, we have conducted a proteomic study to determine whether protein alterations in the foetal placenta induced by the vitrification procedure remain during pregnancy. In this study, we used 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF and LC-MS/MS analysis) to identify the protein changes during middle and late stages of gestation (Day 14 and Day 24, respectively) in rabbit foetal placenta. We identified 11 differentially expressed proteins at Day 14 and 13 proteins at Day 24. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD001840 and PXD001836. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of three proteins, serum albumin, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 [NADP+], and phosphoglycerate mutase 1, which were altered during pregnancy. We demonstrate the existence of changes in foetal placental protein during pregnancy induced by the vitrification procedure, which brings into question whether vitrification effects observed during foetal development could lead to physiological and metabolic disorders in adulthood. This effect, taken together with other effects reported in the literature, suggests that embryo cryopreservation is not neutral.","['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphoglycerate Mutase/metabolism', 'Placenta/chemistry/enzymology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteome/*physiology', 'Rabbits', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', '*Vitrification']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Electron density map', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate calculation', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Mutation ID', 'Molecular replacement', 'Plant biology', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Classification']"
17464315,Gene Expression Analysis of Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Characterization & Reclassification of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma,"In soft tissue sarcomas, the diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) has been a very controversial issue, and MFH is now considered to be reclassified into pleomorphic subtypes of other sarcomas. To characterize MFH genetically, we used an oligonucleotide microarray to analyze gene expression in 105 samples from 10 types of soft tissue tumors. Spindle cell and pleomorphic sarcomas, such as dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), fibrosarcoma and MFH, showed similar gene expression patterns compared to other tumors. Samples from those five sarcoma types could be classified into respective clusters based on gene expression by excluding MFH samples. We calculated distances between MFH samples and other five sarcoma types (dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, MPNST and fibrosarcoma) based on differentially expressed genes and evaluated similarities. Three of the 21 MFH samples showed marked similarities to one of the five sarcoma types, which were supported by histological findings. Although most of the remaining 18 MFH samples showed little or no histological resemblance to one of the five sarcoma types, 12 of them showed moderate similarities in terms of gene expression. These results explain the heterogeneity of MFH and show that the majority of MFHs could be reclassified into pleomorphic subtypes of other sarcomas. Taken together, gene expression profiling could be a useful tool to unveil the difference in the underlying molecular backgrounds, which leads to a rational taxonomy and diagnosis of a diverse group of soft tissue sarcomas.","['Cluster Analysis', 'Fibroma/genetics/pathology', 'Fibrosarcoma/genetics/pathology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous/classification/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sarcoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']","['Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Lipoproteins', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA barcoding', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture']"
17261642,Dysregulation of the circulating and tissue-based renin-angiotensin system in preeclampsia,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) participates in preeclampsia; however, the relative contributions from the circulating RAS and the tissue-based, uteroplacental RAS are unknown. We hypothesized that the tissue-based uteroplacental RAS is dysregulated in preeclampsia. We performed microarray and gene expression studies and confirmed the findings on the protein level by immunohistochemistry in ureteroplacental units from 10 preeclamptic women and 10 women with uneventful pregnancies. All of the women were delivered by cesarean section. We also analyzed plasma renin activity and circulating agonistic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor autoantibodies. In preeclampsia, we found that the angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene was 5-fold upregulated in decidua (maternal origin). We also found AT1 autoantibodies in preeclamptic women and in their offspring by neonatal cardiomyocyte bioassay compared with women with normal pregnancies and their infants (mother: 17.5+/-2.2 versus 0.05+/-0.4; fetus: 14.5+/-1.8 versus 0.5+/-0.5 Deltabpm). Gene expressions for renin (35.0-fold), angiotensin-converting enzyme (2.9-fold), and angiotensinogen (8.9-fold) were higher in decidua than placenta (fetal origin) in both control and preeclamptic women, whereas the AT1 receptor was expressed 10-fold higher in placenta than in decidua in both groups. Our findings elucidate the ureteroplacental unit RAS in preeclamptic and normal pregnancies. We found that, in preeclampsia, the AT1 receptor expression is particularly high in decidua, combined with pregnancy-specific tissue RAS involving decidual angiotensin II production and AT1 autoantibodies. We also showed that AT1 autoantibodies cross the ureteroplacental barrier. These components could participate in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.","['Adult', 'Angiotensins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Decidua/chemistry/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Placenta/chemistry/physiopathology', 'Placental Circulation', 'Pre-Eclampsia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Renin/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology']","['Proteins', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular replacement', 'Plant biology', 'Calculation', 'Retention time prediction', 'Protein-metal contact calculation', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Immunogenetics']"
17566103,Suppression of androgen receptor mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA binding polyamide,"Androgen receptor (AR) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease. A DNA-binding polyamide that targets the consensus androgen response element binds the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter androgen response element, inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells, and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer. Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex) at the same concentration. Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide.

Here, we investigated the role of the long non-coding RNA <i>HOXA-AS2</i> in GSC biology using descriptive and functional analyses of glioma samples classified according to their isocitrate dehydrogenase (<i>IDH</i>) gene mutation status, and of GSC lines. We found that <i>HOXA-AS2</i> is overexpressed only in aggressive (<i>IDHwt</i>) glioma and GSC lines. ShRNA-based depletion of <i>HOXA-AS2</i> in GSCs decreased cell proliferation and altered the expression of several hundreds of genes. Integrative analysis revealed that these expression changes were not associated with changes in DNA methylation or chromatin signatures at the promoter of the majority of genes deregulated following <i>HOXA-AS2</i> silencing in GSCs, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, transcription factor binding motif enrichment and correlation analyses indicated that <i>HOXA-AS2</i> affects, directly or indirectly, the expression of key transcription factors implicated in GCS biology, including E2F8, E2F1, STAT1, and ATF3, thus contributing to GCS aggressiveness by promoting their proliferation and modulating the inflammation pathway.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Glioma/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA']"

34547227,Cues from mRNA splicing prevent default Argonaute silencing in C. elegans,"In animals, Argonaute small-RNA pathways scan germline transcripts to silence self-replicating genetic elements. However, little is known about how endogenous gene expression is recognized and licensed. Here, we show that the presence of introns and, by inference, the process of mRNA splicing prevents default Argonaute-mediated silencing in the C. elegans germline. The silencing of intronless genes is initiated independently of the piRNA pathway but nevertheless engages multiple components of the downstream amplification and maintenance mechanisms that mediate transgenerational silencing, including both nuclear and cytoplasmic members of the worm-specific Argonaute gene family (WAGOs). Small RNAs amplified from intronless mRNAs can trans-silence cognate intron-containing genes. Interestingly, a second, small RNA-independent cis-acting mode of silencing also acts on intronless mRNAs. Our findings suggest that cues put in place during mRNA splicing license germline gene expression and provide evidence for a splicing-dependent and dsRNA- and piRNA-independent mechanism that can program Argonaute silencing.","['Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins/*genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cues', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Germ Cells/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene ID', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Keyword', 'cel', 'CellML', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data']"

In order to identify proteins interacting with extracellularly applied α-syn assemblies (either oligomeric or fibrillar α -syn) and identify in particular plasma membrane proteins exposed extracellularly, we exposed pure-neuronal cultures to oligomeric and fibrillar α-syn for 10 min, pulled down the complex, and identified the associated proteins using a proteomic-based approach. Using pull-down of whole cell lysates and MS, we have identified proteins interacting with extracellularly applied α-syn in three different conditions. Each condition consisted in three experimental replicates of cells exposed 10 min to α-syn assemblies and the non-treated cells used as controls","Extracellular α-synuclein (α-syn) assemblies can be up-taken by neurons; however, their interaction with the plasma membrane and proteins has not been studied specifically. Here we demonstrate that α-syn assemblies form clusters within the plasma membrane of neurons. Using a proteomic-based approach, we identify the α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) as a cell surface partner of α-syn assemblies. The interaction strength depended on the state of α-syn, fibrils being the strongest, oligomers weak, and monomers none. Mutations within the neuron-specific α3-subunit are linked to rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). We show that freely diffusing α3-NKA are trapped within α-syn clusters resulting in α3-NKA redistribution and formation of larger nanoclusters. This creates regions within the plasma membrane with reduced local densities of α3-NKA, thereby decreasing the efficiency of Na+ extrusion following stimulus. Thus, interactions of α3-NKA with extracellular α-syn assemblies reduce its pumping activity as its mutations in RDP/AHC.","['Hemiplegia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Parkinsonian Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/genetics/*metabolism', 'alpha-Synuclein/genetics/*metabolism']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'protein', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Format', 'Alpha diversity data', 'C-alpha trace', 'Protein chain (C-alpha atoms)']"
34376656,A novel propionate production pathway from inositol by commensal Anaerostipes which is known as intestinal butyrate producer was studied. The physiological relevance of this pathway was explored in human gut as well as potential health impact of Anaerostipes species to the human host.,"We describe the anaerobic conversion of inositol stereoisomers to propionate and acetate by the abundant intestinal genus Anaerostipes. A inositol pathway was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance using [<sup>13</sup>C]-inositols, mass spectrometry and proteogenomic analyses in A. rhamnosivorans, identifying 3-oxoacid CoA transferase as a key enzyme involved in both 3-oxopropionyl-CoA and propionate formation. This pathway also allowed conversion of phytate-derived inositol into propionate as shown with [<sup>13</sup>C]-phytate in fecal samples amended with A. rhamnosivorans. Metabolic and (meta)genomic analyses explained the adaptation of Anaerostipes spp. to inositol-containing substrates and identified a propionate-production gene cluster to be inversely associated with metabolic biomarkers in (pre)diabetes cohorts. Co-administration of myo-inositol with live A. rhamnosivorans in western-diet fed mice reduced fasting-glucose levels comparing to heat-killed A. rhamnosivorans after 6-weeks treatment. Altogether, these data suggest a potential beneficial role for intestinal Anaerostipes spp. in promoting host health.","['Acetates/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Clostridiales/classification/*metabolism/physiology', 'Diet', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Host Microbial Interactions', 'Humans', 'Inositol/*metabolism', 'Intestines/*chemistry/microbiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phytic Acid/metabolism', 'Propionates/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods']","['ACE', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'NET', 'Sequence', 'Protein interactions', 'Microbial collection', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Parasitology', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'NMR', 'NMR data format', 'MRI', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acids', 'Protein properties', 'Protein property', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum']"
33210925,Our goal is the identification of more and more missing proteins from cancer cell lines. This project focuses on D283 med and U-118mg cell lines which contribute to 12 missing protein identification.,"Since the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) was launched in 2010, many techniques have been adopted for the discovery of missing proteins (MPs). Because of these efforts, only 1481 MPs remained as of July 2020; however, by relying only on technique optimization, researchers have reached a bottleneck in MP discovery. Protein expression is tissue- or cell-type-dependent. The tissues of the human testis and brain have been reported to harbor a large number of tissue-specific genes and proteins; however, few studies have been performed on human brain tissue or cells to identify MPs. Herein a metastatic cell line derived from brain cancer, D283 Med, was used to search for MPs. With a traditional and simple shotgun workflow to separate the peptides into 20 fractions, 12 MPs containing at least two unique non-nested peptides (amino acid length ≥9) were identified in this cell line with a protein false discovery rate of <1%. Following the same experimental protocol, only one MP was found in a nonmetastatic brain cancer cell line, U-118 MG. Furthermore, 12 MPs were verified as having two non-nested unique peptides by matching them with corresponding chemically synthesized peptides through parallel reaction monitoring. These results clearly demonstrate that the appropriate selection of experimental materials, either tissues or cell lines, is imperative for MP discovery. The data obtained in this study are available via ProteomeXchange (PXD021482) and PeptideAtlas (PASS01627).","['Cell Line', '*Cerebellar Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medulloblastoma/genetics', 'Peptides', 'Proteomics']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Peptide property', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

EBV encodes a conserved protein kinase BGLF4 that plays a key role in the viral life cycle. To provide new insight into the host proteins regulated by BGLF4, we utilized SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to compare site-specific phosphorylation in BGLF4-expressing cells and found up-regulated phosphorylation of 3,046 unique sites on 1,328 proteins. Motif analysis of the upregulated phospho-proteins found enrichment in CDK1/BGLF4, ATM, ATR and Aurora kinase substrates while functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to the DNA damage response, mitosis and cell cycle plus phosphorylation of nuclear pore proteins. Phosphorylation of proteins associated with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) indicated checkpoint activation, an event that inactivates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, APC/C. Our data reveal that manipulation of mitotic kinase signaling and SAC activation are mechanisms associated with lytic EBV replication.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically linked to infectious mononucleosis and several human cancers.

To provide new insight into the host proteins regulated by BGLF4, we utilized stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics to compare site-specific phosphorylation in BGLF4-expressing Akata B cells. Our analysis revealed BGLF4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of 3,046 unique sites corresponding to 1,328 proteins. Frequency analysis of these phosphosites revealed a proline-rich motif signature downstream of BGLF4, indicating a broader substrate recognition for BGLF4 than its cellular ortholog cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Further, motif analysis of the hyperphosphorylated sites revealed enrichment in ATM, ATR and Aurora kinase substrates while functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to the DNA damage response (DDR), mitosis and cell cycle. Phosphorylation of proteins associated with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) indicated checkpoint activation, an event that inactivates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome, APC/C. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BGLF4 binds to and directly phosphorylates the key cellular proteins PP1, MPS1 and CDC20 that lie upstream of SAC activation and APC/C inhibition. Consistent with APC/C inactivation, we found that BGLF4 stabilizes the expression of many known APC/C substrates. We also noted hyperphosphorylation of 22 proteins associated the nuclear pore complex, which may contribute to nuclear pore disassembly and SAC activation. A drug that inhibits mitotic checkpoint activation also suppressed the accumulation of extracellular EBV virus. Taken together, our data reveal that, in addition to the DDR, manipulation of mitotic kinase signaling and SAC activation are mechanisms associated with lytic EBV replication.

26999731,"In Hawaii, a rapidly-evolving mutation in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus silences males by interfering with the development of sound-producing structures on their forewings. The mutation is called flatwing (fw), and it persists because of natural selection imposed by an acoustically-orienting parasitoid. We examined gene expression differences between wild-type and mutant crickets, focusing on juvenile wing buds. We profiled mRNA expression levels using RNA-seq, and characterized the wing bud proteome using quantitative mass spectrometry. Accessing protein expression profiles under the same experimental conditions enabled us to test correspondence between the two ‘omic levels.","A major advance in modern evolutionary biology is the ability to start linking phenotypic evolution in the wild with genomic changes that underlie that evolution. We capitalized on a rapidly evolving Hawaiian population of crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to test hypotheses about the genomic consequences of a recent Mendelian mutation of large effect which disrupts the development of sound-producing structures on male forewings. The resulting silent phenotype, flatwing, persists because of natural selection imposed by an acoustically orienting parasitoid, but it interferes with mate attraction. We examined gene expression differences in developing wing buds of wild-type and flatwing male crickets using RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics. Most differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were down-regulated in flatwing males (625 up vs. 1716 down), whereas up- and down-regulated proteins were equally represented (30 up and 34 down). Differences between morphs were clearly not restricted to a single pathway, and we recovered annotations associated with a broad array of functions that would not be predicted a priori. Using a candidate gene detection test based on homology, we identified 30% of putative Drosophila wing development genes in the cricket transcriptome, but only 10% were DE. In addition to wing-related annotations, endocrine pathways and several biological processes such as reproduction, immunity and locomotion were DE in the mutant crickets at both biological levels. Our results illuminate the breadth of genetic pathways that are potentially affected in the early stages of adaptation.","['Animals', '*Genetic Variation', 'Gryllidae/*genetics', 'Hawaii', 'Locomotion', 'Male', '*Phenotype', 'Proteomics', '*RNA, Messenger', 'Wings, Animal/*growth & development']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Genetic mapping', 'Validation', 'EMBL feature location', 'Promoter prediction', 'Locus annotation', 'MAT', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"

By selectively disrupturing the outer membrane (OM), this peptidomimetic displayed a novel mechanism of action and opens new avenues for developing antibiotics that specifically target the OM of Gram-negative bacteria.","Increasing antibacterial resistance presents a major challenge in antibiotic discovery. One attractive target in Gram-negative bacteria is the unique asymmetric outer membrane (OM), which acts as a permeability barrier that protects the cell from external stresses, such as the presence of antibiotics. We describe a novel β-hairpin macrocyclic peptide JB-95 with potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. This peptide exhibits no cellular lytic activity, but electron microscopy and fluorescence studies reveal an ability to selectively disrupt the OM but not the inner membrane of E. coli. The selective targeting of the OM probably occurs through interactions of JB-95 with selected β-barrel OM proteins, including BamA and LptD as shown by photolabeling experiments. Membrane proteomic studies reveal rapid depletion of many β-barrel OM proteins from JB-95-treated E. coli, consistent with induction of a membrane stress response and/or direct inhibition of the Bam folding machine. The results suggest that lethal disruption of the OM by JB-95 occurs through a novel mechanism of action at key interaction sites within clusters of β-barrel proteins in the OM. These findings open new avenues for developing antibiotics that specifically target β-barrel proteins and the integrity of the Gram-negative OM.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Peptidomimetics/*pharmacology']","['Protein variants', 'Plant biology', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Peptide property', 'Genetics', 'Lipids']"

Stress can decrease NMD efficiency and thus increase the mRNA levels of physiological NMD targets. As stress can also inhibit translation, the net outcome for shaping the proteome is difficult to predict.

Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and viral suppression are two such manipulations driven by uncharacterised mechanisms. To gain insight into potential molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects, we performed the first in-depth proteomic characterisation of the host response to Wolbachia infection. We find that the presence of the Wolbachia wMelPop in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells alters levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication, autophagy, vesicular trafficking, iron homeostasis, amino acid degradation, purine metabolism, lipid metabolism and immunity. The majority of the cell cycle/DNA replication proteins were downregulated in the presence of Wolbachia, in particular, a member of the anoctamin family was strongly down regulated which may be related to the chromosomal segregation defects observed in CI crosses. We found clear evidence for perturbed lipid metabolism, Wolbachia infected cells expressed higher levels of Apolipoprotein D and the cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1, while the LDL receptor and fatty acid synthase were downregulated. ABCA1 was also upregulated at the mRNA level in adult Wolbachia infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia therefore perturbs cholesterol homeostasis causing the host cell to respond to an apparent cholesterol excess which may contribute to viral inhibition.","Wolbachia are intracellular maternally inherited bacteria that can spread through insect populations and block virus transmission by mosquitoes, providing an important approach to dengue control. To better understand the mechanisms of virus inhibition, we here perform proteomic quantification of the effects of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells and midgut. Perturbations are observed in vesicular trafficking, lipid metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum that could impact viral entry and replication. Wolbachia-infected cells display a differential cholesterol profile, including elevated levels of esterified cholesterol, that is consistent with perturbed intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Cyclodextrins have been shown to reverse lipid accumulation defects in cells with disrupted cholesterol homeostasis. Treatment of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin restores dengue replication in Wolbachia-carrying cells, suggesting dengue is inhibited in Wolbachia-infected cells by localised cholesterol accumulation. These results demonstrate parallels between the cellular Wolbachia viral inhibition phenotype and lipid storage genetic disorders. Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes can block dengue virus infection and is tested in field trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Using proteomics, Geoghegan et al. here identify effects of Wolbachia on cholesterol homeostasis and dengue virus replication in Aedes aegypti.","['Aedes/*metabolism/*microbiology/virology', 'Animals', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Dengue/*transmission/virology', 'Dengue Virus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Wolbachia/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plasmid map', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Catalogue ID', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease']"
26801919,"Expression of proteins regulating apoptosis (BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-X and BAX) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts at diagnosis have been shown to be associated with disease-free survival. We previously found that the initially high apoptosis-resistance of AML cells decreased after therapy, while regaining high levels at relapse. This suggested a dynamic regulation of apoptosis. This data is from the lysate fraction of the secretomes described in PXD001476.","Expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 - BCL-2, Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 - MCL-1, BCL-2 like 1 - BCL-X and BCL-2-associated X protein - BAX) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts at diagnosis is associated with disease-free survival. We previously found that the initially high apoptosis-resistance of AML cells decreased after therapy, while regaining high levels at relapse. Herein, we further explored this aspect of dynamic apoptosis regulation in AML. First, we showed that the intraindividualex vivoapoptosis-related profiles of normal lymphocytes and AML blasts within the bone marrow of AML patients were highly correlated. The expression values of apoptosis-regulating proteins were far beyond healthy control lymphocytes, which implicates the influence of microenvironmental factors. Second, we demonstrated that apoptosis-resistant primary AML blasts, as opposed to apoptosis-sensitive cells, were able to up-regulate BCL-2 expression in sensitive AML blasts in contact cultures (p= 0.0067 andp= 1.0, respectively). Using secretome proteomics, we identified novel proteins possibly engaged in apoptosis regulation. Intriguingly, this analysis revealed that major functional protein clusters engaged in global gene regulation, including mRNA splicing, protein translation, and chromatin remodeling, were more abundant (p= 4.01E-06) in secretomes of apoptosis-resistant AML. These findings were confirmed by subsequent extracellular vesicle proteomics. Finally, confocal-microscopy-based colocalization studies show that splicing factors-containing vesicles secreted by high AAI cells are taken up by low AAI cells. The current results constitute the first comprehensive analysis of proteins released by apoptosis-resistant and sensitive primary AML cells. Together, the data point to vesicle-mediated release of global gene regulatory protein clusters as a plausible novel mechanism of induction of apoptosis resistance. Deciphering the modes of communication between apoptosis-resistant blasts may in perspective lead to the discovery of prognostic tools and development of novel therapeutic interventions, aimed at limiting or overcoming therapy resistance.","['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Exome sequencing', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Tumor annotation']"
27250689,"Budding yeast Tsr1 is an essential ribosome biogenesis factor that is required for cytoplasmic steps in 40S subunit maturation. S. cerevisiae Tsr1 was expressed as an N-terminal GST fusion protein in E. coli. A mutant Tsr1ΔNΔloop was generated in which residues 410 to 476 of Tsr1 were replaced with a short glycine and serine rich sequence; in addition, the N-ternimal 45 amino acid residues were replaced by five amino acid residues “GPDSD”. Tsr1ΔNΔloop allowed for generating native crystals that diffracted to 3.6 Å. Here we characterize both wild type Tsr1 and Tsr1ΔNΔloop using cross-linking/mass spectrometry.","Budding yeast Tsr1 is a ribosome biogenesis factor with sequence similarity to GTPases, which is essential for cytoplasmic steps in 40S subunit maturation. Here we present the crystal structure of Tsr1 at 3.6 Å. Tsr1 has a similar domain architecture to translational GTPases such as EF-Tu and the selenocysteine incorporation factor SelB. However, active site residues required for GTP binding and hydrolysis are absent, explaining the lack of enzymatic activity in previous analyses. Modelling of Tsr1 into cryo-electron microscopy maps of pre-40S particles shows that a highly acidic surface of Tsr1 is presented on the outside of pre-40S particles, potentially preventing premature binding to 60S subunits. Late pre-40S maturation also requires the GTPase eIF5B and the ATPase Rio1. The location of Tsr1 is predicted to block binding by both factors, strongly indicating that removal of Tsr1 is an essential step during cytoplasmic maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ribosome Subunits, Small, Eukaryotic/genetics/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Sequence', 'CATH domain ID', 'CATH domain report', 'Protein domain', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular mass', 'X-ray diffraction', 'Protein structure assignment (from X-ray crystallographic data)', 'Tomography', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'protein', 'Helical net', 'Proteins', 'Helical wheel', 'Strain data format', 'Information extraction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction data', 'Kinase name', 'Protein threading', 'Protein databases', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Sequence alignment']"

30150368,"N-terminal (Nt) acetylation, catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), has emerged as an important co-translational modification in eukaryotes, and involves the transfer of the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) to the α-amino group of a nascent polypeptide. Here, we report the first global study of Nt-acetylation in response to changes in nutrient availability in S. cerevisiae. Despite major fluctuations in Ac-CoA and histone acetylation levels, our study reveals that the steady-state levels of protein Nt-acetylation remains largely unaffected by changes in cellular metabolism. Accordingly, Ac-CoA does not appear to act as a master switch for protein Nt-acetylation. Interestingly however, we identified two distinct sets of N-termini that are differentially Nt-acetylated following nutrient starvation. The first set of proteins, enriched for annotated N-termini, generally displayed an increased Nt-acetylation in stationary phase compared to exponential growth phase, despite a significant reduction in Ac-CoA levels. In contrast, the second set of proteins, enriched for alternative non-annotated N-termini (i.e. N-terminal proteoforms), generally became less acetylated in stationary phase. In particular, the degree of Nt-acetylation of Pcl8, a negative regulator of glycogen biosynthesis and two components of the pre-ribosome complex (Rsa3 and Rpl7a) increased during starvation. Moreover, the levels of these proteins were regulated by both starvation and the presence of NatA activity. Overall, our data provide the first proteome-wide survey on metabolic regulation of Nt-acetylation, and propose Nt-acetylation-mediated steering of metabolism and ribosome biogenesis.","N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) is a highly abundant protein modification in eukaryotes and impacts a wide range of cellular processes, including protein quality control and stress tolerance. Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms regulating Nt-acetylation are still nebulous. Here, we present the first global study of Nt-acetylation in yeast cells as they progress to stationary phase in response to nutrient starvation. Surprisingly, we found that yeast cells maintain their global Nt-acetylation levels upon nutrient depletion, despite a marked decrease in acetyl-CoA levels. We further observed two distinct sets of protein N termini that display differential and opposing Nt-acetylation behavior upon nutrient starvation, indicating a dynamic process. The first protein cluster was enriched for annotated N termini showing increased Nt-acetylation in stationary phase compared with exponential growth phase. The second protein cluster was conversely enriched for alternative nonannotated N termini (<i>i.e.</i> N termini indicative of shorter N-terminal proteoforms) and, like histones, showed reduced acetylation levels in stationary phase when acetyl-CoA levels were low. Notably, the degree of Nt-acetylation of Pcl8, a negative regulator of glycogen biosynthesis and two components of the pre-ribosome complex (Rsa3 and Rpl7a) increased during starvation. Moreover, the steady-state levels of these proteins were regulated both by starvation and NatA activity. In summary, this study represents the first comprehensive analysis of metabolic regulation of Nt-acetylation and reveals that specific, rather than global, Nt-acetylation events are subject to metabolic regulation.","['Acetyl Coenzyme A/*metabolism', 'Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'N-Terminal Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*enzymology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'DNA methylation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Methylation calling', 'Keyword', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Dirichlet distribution', 'Dirichlet distribution format', 'Isotopic distributions calculation', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Histogram', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Terminal gap opening penalty', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum']"
28111955,"A key step in proteomics is the digestion of proteins into peptides, so far largely done by using trypsin. Tryptic digestion leads to peptides that in ESI-MS attain predominantly two charges, via protonation at the free N-terminus and at the C-terminal basic residue Arginine or Lysine. These peptides can be readily sequenced and identified by collision-induced dissociation (CID) or higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), as the fragmentation rules are well understood. Here we explore the trypsin mirror protease, LysargiNase, which cleaves equally specifically at Arg and Lys, albeit at the N-terminal end. The resulting peptides are therefore practically tryptic-alike in length and sequence, except that the two charges are now both positioned at the N-terminus.

FC2 IITG was investigated using multipronged quantitative proteomics and multiple reaction monitoring assays. Physiological data suggested a remarkably enhanced lipid accumulation with concomitant reduction in carbon flux towards carbohydrate, protein and chlorophyll biosynthesis. The proteomics-based investigations identified the down-regulation of enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis (porphobilinogen deaminase) and photosynthetic carbon fixation (sedoheptulose-1,7 bisphosphate and phosphoribulokinase). Profound up-regulation of hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrogenase and enoyl-ACP reductase ascertained lipid accumulation. The carbon skeletons to be integrated into lipid precursors were regenerated by glycolysis, β-oxidation and TCA cycle. The enhanced expression of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes indicates heightened energy needs of FC2 cells for the sustenance of N-starvation.

PRM experiment was performed in time-course manner, without peptide standards usage. PRM data was inspected in Skyline 3.1 software. In order to check peptide identity we developed spectrum library based on shotgun mass-spectrometry data, which has been obtained for HL-60 cells protein samples at 0, 3, 24, 48 and 96h after ATRA treatment.","Targeted mass spectrometry represents a powerful tool for investigation of biological processes. The convenient approach of selected reaction monitoring using stable isotope-labeled peptide standard (SIS) is widely applied for protein quantification. Along with this method, high-resolution parallel reaction monitoring has been increasingly used for protein targeted analysis. Here we applied two targeted approaches (selected reaction monitoring with SIS and label-free parallel reaction monitoring) to investigate expression of 11 proteins during all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. In our experiments, we have determined the proteins expression ratio at 3, 24, 48, and 96 h after all-trans retinoic acid treatment in comparison with 0 h, respectively. Expression profiles of four proteins (VAV1, PRAM1, LYN, and CEBPB) were highly correlated ( r > 0.75) and FGR expression was detected on proteome level starting from 24 h by both techniques. For prominent differences (fold change ≥ 2) label-free parallel reaction monitoring is not inferior to selected reaction monitoring with isotopically labeled peptide standards.

29168982,"According to the /N-end rule pathway, proteins with basic N-termini are targeted for degradation by the Arabidopsis thaliana E3 ligase, PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6). Here, we undertook a quantitative proteomics study of N-end rule mutant prt6, to investigate the impact of this pathway on the etiolated seedling. Isolation of N-terminal peptides using terminal amine isotope labelling of samples (TAILS) combined with Tandem mass tag (TMT) identified over 3000 unique N-termini.

TMT-TAILS identified over 4000 unique N-terminal peptides representing c. 2000 protein groups. Forty-five protein groups exhibited significantly increased N-terminal peptide abundance in prt6 seedlings, including cruciferins, major seed storage proteins, which were regulated by Group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERFVII) transcription factors, known substrates of PRT6. Mobilisation of endosperm α-cruciferin was delayed in prt6 seedlings. N-termini of several proteases were downregulated in prt6, including RD21A. RD21A transcript, protein and activity levels were downregulated in a largely ERFVII-dependent manner.

We generated a comprehensive quantitative and differential proteome of murine Tregs and conventional T cells. We identified 5225 proteins, 164 of which were differentially expressed in Tregs. Together with the comparative analysis of proteome and gene expression data, we identified TCF7 as a promising candidate. Genetic elimination of transcription factor 7 (TCF7) led to increased fractions of Tregs in the thymus. Reduced levels of TCF7, found in the heterozygote, resulted in a greater potential for Treg precursors to differentiate into the Treg lineage. In contrast, activation of TCF7 through β-catenin had the opposite effect. TCF7 levels influenced the required TCR signaling strength of Treg precursors, and TCF7 deficiency broadened the repertoire and allowed lower TCR affinities to be recruited into the Treg lineage. FOXP3 was able to repress TCF7 protein expression.

To further investigate this entity we aimed to characterize protein profiles of cyst fluids from cPTC and benign thyroid cystic lesions. In total, 20 cPTCs and 56 benign thyroid cystic lesions were studied. Profiling by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on cyst fluids from a subset of cases after depletion, and selected proteins were further analyzed by Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 1,581 proteins were detected in cyst fluids, of which 841 were quantified in all samples using LC-MS/MS. Proteins with different expression levels between cPTCs and benign lesions were identified by univariate analysis (41 proteins) and multivariate analysis (59 proteins in an orthogonal partial least squares model). WB analyses of cyst fluid and IHC on corresponding tissue samples confirmed a significant up-regulation of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19/CYFRA 21-1) and S100A13 in cPTC vs. benign lesions. These findings were further confirmed by ELISA in an extended material of non-depleted cyst fluids from cPTCs (n = 17) and benign lesions (n = 55) (p<0.05). Applying a cut-off at >55 ng/ml for CK-19 resulted in 82% specificity and sensitivity. For S100A13 a cut-off at >230 pg/ml revealed a 94% sensitivity, but only 35% specificity. This is the first comprehensive catalogue of the protein content in fluid from thyroid cysts.

19774072,UB/OC-1 differentiation,"We have studied the function of the zinc finger transcription factor gata3 in auditory system development by analysing temporal profiles of gene expression during differentiation of conditionally immortal cell lines derived to model specific auditory cell types and developmental stages. We tested and applied a novel probabilistic method called the gamma Model for Oligonucleotide Signals to analyse hybridization signals from Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Expression levels estimated by this method correlated closely (p<0.0001) across a 10-fold range with those measured by quantitative RT-PCR for a sample of 61 different genes. In an unbiased list of 26 genes whose temporal profiles clustered most closely with that of gata3 in all cell lines, 10 were linked to Insulin-like Growth Factor signalling, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB. Knock-down of gata3 in vitro was associated with a decrease in expression of genes linked to IGF-signalling, including IGF1, IGF2 and several IGF-binding proteins. It also led to a small decrease in protein levels of the serine-threonine kinase Akt2/PKBbeta, a dramatic increase in Akt1/PKBalpha protein and relocation of Akt1/PKBalpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), a known target of PKB/Akt, simultaneously decreased. In heterozygous gata3 null mice the expression of gata3 correlated with high levels of activated Akt/PKB.

However, changes in glutathionylome in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial cellular process for embryonic development, wound healing, and carcinoma progression and metastasis, have not been fully characterized. Our previous study revealed that CD38 overexpression decreased cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels and caused cells to undergo EMT. In the present study, we engineered a cell system in which the glutathione synthetase (GS) mutant was expressed that catalyzed the formation of a glutathione analogue from azido-alanine to profile changes of glutathionylome in CD38-overexpressing cells. We identified 1298 glutathionylated proteins and revealed that proteins with changed glutathionylation levels involved in EMT associated pathways including epithelial adherens junction, actin cytoskeleton, and integrin signaling. Moreover, the glutathionylation level of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) was increased in CD38-overexpressing cells. We further demonstrated that glutathionylation of Cys63 residue in 15-PGDH led to decreased enzymatic activity that could promote EMT by increasing prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). Taken together, these results indicate that the clickable glutathione is an effective probe for glutathionylome profiling, and glutathionylation of 15-PGDH on Cys63 inhibits its enzymatic activity to promote EMT.","['*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', '*Glutathione/metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction']","['Transition matrix', 'Name', 'Protein interaction data processing', 'protein', 'Protein modifications', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

34403557,RNA-seq of the overexpressors of site-directed mutant of PhADT,"Out of the three aromatic amino acids, the highest flux in plants is directed towards phenylalanine, which is utilized to synthesize proteins and thousands of phenolic metabolites contributing to plant fitness. Phenylalanine is produced predominantly in plastids via the shikimate pathway and subsequent arogenate pathway, both of which are subject to complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Previously, it was shown that allosteric feedback inhibition of arogenate dehydratase (ADT), which catalyzes the final step of the arogenate pathway, restricts flux through phenylalanine biosynthesis. Here, we show that in petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers, which typically produce high phenylalanine levels, ADT regulation is relaxed, but not eliminated. Moderate expression of a feedback-insensitive ADT increased flux towards phenylalanine, while high overexpression paradoxically reduced phenylalanine formation. This reduction could be partially, but not fully, recovered by bypassing other known metabolic flux control points in the aromatic amino acid network. Using comparative transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and metabolic flux analysis, we discovered that transcriptional regulation of the d-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase gene in the pentose phosphate pathway controls flux into the shikimate pathway. Taken together, our findings reveal that regulation within and upstream of the shikimate pathway shares control over phenylalanine biosynthesis in the plant cell.","['Carbohydrate Epimerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Flowers/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Hydro-Lyases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Petunia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenylalanine/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Plant Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Plastids/genetics/metabolism', 'Secondary Metabolism/genetics', 'Shikimic Acid/metabolism']","['Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate report', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Power test', 'Primers', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Protein hydropathy data', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'PEtab', 'Phenomics', 'Phenotype name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Genetic engineering', 'Plant biology', 'Genetics', 'Lipids', 'Nucleic acids', 'Ensembl ID', 'Drug metabolism', 'Secondary structure', 'Secondary structure alignment metadata', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid report']"
35422476,Identification of genes regulated by ID2 in Ewing sarcoma cells.,"Sarcomas are difficult to treat and the therapy, even when effective, is associated with long-term and life-threatening side effects. In addition, the treatment regimens for many sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma, are relatively unchanged over the past two decades, indicating a critical lack of progress. Although differentiation-based therapies are used for the treatment of some cancers, the application of this approach to sarcomas has proven challenging. Here, using a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout approach, we show that Inhibitor of DNA Binding 2 (ID2) is a critical regulator of developmental-related genes and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in Ewing sarcoma tumors. We also identified that homoharringtonine, which is an inhibitor of protein translation and FDA-approved for the treatment of leukemia, decreases the level of the ID2 protein and significantly reduces tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival in an Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. Furthermore, in addition to targeting ID2, homoharringtonine also reduces the protein levels of ID1 and ID3, which are additional members of the ID family of proteins with well-described roles in tumorigenesis, in multiple types of cancer. Overall, these results provide insight into developmental regulation in Ewing sarcoma tumors and identify a novel, therapeutic approach to target the ID family of proteins using an FDA-approved drug.","['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Developmental', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', '*Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/genetics', 'Mice', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Information extraction', 'Cell migration track image', 'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Medicines research and development', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Protein identification', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Genome visualisation', 'DNA barcoding', 'Chromatogram visualisation']"

Post-mating changes in protein expression level in the noble crayfish Astacus astacus spermatophore were quantified. In-gel digestion and high resolution mass spectrometry were used for label-free protein quantification. One hundred twelve proteins were identified in the spermatophore of noble crayfish. After 7 days of storage on the body of the female, 6 proteins were identified in the post-mating spermatophore that showed significant up-regulation and 4 significant down-regulations (p < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2). The highest rate of up-regulation was observed in sodium/hydrogen exchanger, which may indicate the importance of intracellular pH adjustment for final maturation of the crayfish spermatozoon. The highest rate of down-regulation was observed in histone H2A. This may increase chromatin flexibility and facilitate its transfer into the oocyte during fertilization.

Here, we use immunoaffinity-coupled high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize global tyrosine phosphorylation patterns across two large panels of human PDAC cell lines: the ATCC series (19 cell lines) and TKCC series (17 cell lines). This resulted in the identification and quantification of over 1800 class 1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites and the consistent segregation of both PDAC cell line series into three subtypes with distinct tyrosine phosphorylation profiles. Subtype-selective signaling networks were characterized by identification of subtype-enriched phosphosites together with pathway and network analyses. This revealed that the three subtypes characteristic of the ATCC series were associated with perturbations in signaling networks associated with cell-cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchyme transition, mRNA metabolism, and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, respectively. Specifically, the third subtype exhibited enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple RTKs including the EGFR, ERBB3 and MET. Interestingly, a similar RTK-enriched subtype was identified in the TKCC series, and 'classifier' sites for each series identified using Random Forest models were able to predict the subtypes of the alternate series with high accuracy, highlighting the conservation of the three subtypes across the two series. Finally, RTK-enriched cell lines from both series exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the small molecule EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, indicating that their phosphosignature may provide a predictive biomarker for response to this targeted therapy. These studies highlight how resolution of subtype-selective signaling networks can provide a novel taxonomy for particular cancers, and provide insights into PDAC biology that can be exploited for improved patient management.","['Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Using predictive mathematical modelling and experimental validation in MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal breast cancer cells, we show that Rac1 and RhoA interactions via the PAK-family kinases can produce bistable, switch-like responses to a graded PAK inhibition. Using a small chemical inhibitor of PAK we confirm the model conjecture demonstrating that cellular RhoA and Rac activation levels respond in a bistable manner to PAK inhibition where for a given inhibition level these levels are high or low depending on the history of the system. Consequently, we show that downstream signalling, actin dynamics and cell migration also behave in a bistable fashion, displaying abrupt switches and hysteresis in response to PAK inhibition. In summary, our results demonstrate that PAK is a critical component in the Rac1-RhoA inhibitory crosstalk that mediates bistable GTPase activity and cell migration switches.","Dynamic interactions between RhoA and Rac1, members of the Rho small GTPase family, play a vital role in the control of cell migration.

29046292,"The urea channel Slc14a2 (or UT-A1) mediates vasopressin-regulated urea transport across the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). Previously, UT-A1 was found to present in a high molecular weight complex, suggesting UT-A1 is involved in certain protein-protein interactions. The present study sought to identify the proteins that interact with UT-A1 in this complex for a better understanding of how UT-A1 is regulated. Rat IMCD suspensions were treated with or without V2 receptor agonist, dDAVP, followed by in-cell crosslinking using BSOCOES and detergent solubilization. Immunoprecipitation using Dynabeads coated with UT-A1 specific antibody successfully pulled down the UT-A1 proteins. In-gel digestion protocol was carried out to prepare samples for liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides using a Velos-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The peptides passing stringent spectral quality thresholds were quantified (label-free) to identify those with (UTA-1 antibody/preimmune IgG) >4. A total of 128 UT-A1 interacting proteins were identified. Gene Ontology analysis maps the distribution of these proteins throughout major cell compartments: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosomes, cytosol and plasma membrane. Among them are four protein kinases (Cdc42bpb, Phkb, Camk2d, Mtor) that play roles in vasopressin-regulated phosphorylation of UT-A1. Non-label quantification was also performed to determine the stoichiometry of UT-A3 with UT-A1, the result does not support an oligomeric complex formation of UT-A1/A3. In conclusion, we have provided a refined list of UT-A1 binding proteins which can be useful for further analysis of the vasopressin signaling pathway in regulation of UT-A1 in IMCD.","The urea channel UT-A1 and the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) mediate vasopressin-regulated transport in the renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). To identify the proteins that interact with UT-A1 and AQP2 in native rat IMCD cells, we carried out chemical cross-linking followed by detergent solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and LC-MS/MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated material. The analyses revealed 133 UT-A1-interacting proteins and 139 AQP2-interacting proteins, each identified in multiple replicates. Fifty-three proteins that were present in both the UT-A1 and the AQP2 interactomes can be considered as mediators of housekeeping interactions, likely common to all plasma membrane proteins. Among proteins unique to the UT-A1 list were those involved in posttranslational modifications: phosphorylation (protein kinases Cdc42bpb, Phkb, Camk2d, and Mtor), ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation (Uba1, Usp9x), and neddylation (Nae1 and Uba3). Among the proteins unique to the AQP2 list were several Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab2a, Rab5b, Rab5c, Rab7a, Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab14, Rab17) involved in membrane trafficking. UT-A1 was found to interact with UT-A3, although quantitative proteomics revealed that most UT-A1 molecules in the cell are not bound to UT-A3. In vitro incubation of UT-A1 peptides with the protein kinases identified in the UT-A1 interactome revealed that all except Mtor were capable of phosphorylating known sites in UT-A1. Overall, the UT-A1 and AQP2 interactomes provide a snapshot of a dynamic process in which UT-A1 and AQP2 are produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, processed through the Golgi apparatus, delivered to endosomes that move into and out of the plasma membrane, and are regulated in the plasma membrane.","['Animals', 'Aquaporin 2/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Computational Biology', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kidney Medulla/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Collecting/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Vasopressin/agonists/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mapping', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Data acquisition', 'Sample collections', 'Microbial collection', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Transmembrane protein analysis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Protein databases', 'protein', 'Kinase name', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Mice or rats', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum']"
27432471,"It has been found that A Disintergrin And Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12) is significantly higher in multiple tumors and it has been used as a prognostic marker for cancer progression. Several ADAM12 substrates have been identified biochemically and the role of -its proteolytic function has been explored. However, its non-proteolytic function and its interacting partners have not been systematically studied. In this work, we used a MS-based quantitative proteomic approach to identify the interacting partners of the full length ADAM12 in a cervical cancer cell line. ThroughAfter bioinformatic analyses and biochemical experiments, we found that ADAM12 could regulate its interacting partners through its non-enzymatic function, such as leading to the enhanced expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. In addition, the stability of ADAM12 itself was enhanced by myoferlin, which regulates cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Together, with previous findings, ADAM12 may be an intermediate molecule that links the high expression of myoferlin and vimentin in cancer progression. This result may reveal the potential non-proteolytic function of ADAM12 in cancer cellularcell biology. The information obtained here may be used to develop new strategies to alter the signaling pathways involving the non-catalytic function of ADAM12.","A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12) is expressed significantly higher in multiple tumors than in normal tissues and has been used as a prognostic marker for the evaluation of cancer progression. Although several ADAM12 substrates have been identified biochemically and its proteolytic function has been explored, the upstream regulators and the interacting proteins have not been systematically investigated. Here, we use immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomic approaches to identify 28 interacting partners for the long form of ADAM12 (ADAM12-L) in HeLa cells. Proteins that regulate cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition are among the identified ADAM12-interacting proteins. Further biochemical experiments discover that the protein level and the stability of ADAM12 are upregulated by one of its interacting proteins, myoferlin. In addition, myoferlin also increases the proteolytic activity of ADAM12, leading to the reduction of an ADAM12 substrate, E-cadherin. This result implies that ADAM12 and its interacting proteins might converge to certain signaling pathways in the regulation of cancer cell progression.

Despite being broadly distributed in global geothermal systems, only three Nanoarchaeota have been successfully co-cultivated with their hosts, and until now no nanoarchaeotal cultures or genomes have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We recovered three nanoarchaeotal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (M10-121), Guaymas Basin (Gua-46) and the Mid-Cayman Rise (MC-1). Based on average amino acid identity analysis, M10-121 is a novel species in the candidate genus Nanoclepta, while the other two MAGs represent novel genera in the Nanoarchaeota. Like previously sequenced Nanoarchaeota, each MAG encodes at least one split protein-coding gene. The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for gluconeogenesis and archaeal flagella. MC-1 also encodes the pentose bisphosphate pathway, which may allow the nanoarchaeote to bypass several steps in glycolysis and produce ATP.","['Archaea/classification/genetics', 'Archaeal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Archaeal/genetics', 'Genome, Archaeal/*genetics', 'Hydrothermal Vents/*microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Nanoarchaeota/classification/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","['Prokaryotes and Archaea', 'Gene-set enrichment analysis', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Protein hydropathy data', 'Metagenomics', 'Genomics', 'Metagenomic sequencing', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'RNA', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
30291158,"Settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC) is a protein that acts as a phoromone cue to attract conspecific of the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite to settle on a substrate. Recombinant settlement-inducing protein complex was expressed in insect Sf9 cells through a baculovirus overexpression system, purified and analysed by mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.","Reproduction in barnacles relies on chemical cues that guide their gregarious settlement. These cues have been pinned down to several sources of settlement pheromones, one of which is a protein termed settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC), a large glycoprotein acting as a pheromone to induce larval settlement and as an adhesive in surface exploration by the cyprids. Settlement assays in laboratory conditions with <i>Amphibalanus</i> (=<i>Balanus</i>) <i>amphitrite</i> cyprids in the presence of SIPC showed that cyprids exhibit settlement preference behaviour at lower concentrations of SIPC [half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>)=3.73 nmol l<sup>-1</sup>] and settlement avoidance behaviour at higher concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>=101 nmol l<sup>-1</sup>). By using truncated fragments of SIPC in settlement assays, we identify that domains at the N-terminus of SIPC transduce settlement preference cues that mask the settlement avoidance cues transduced by domains at its C-terminus. Removing the N-terminal 600 amino acids from SIPC resulted in truncated fragments that transduced only settlement avoidance cues to the cyprids. From the sexual reproduction point of view, this bimodal response of barnacles to SIPC suggests that barnacles will settle gregariously when conspecific cues are sparse but will not settle if conspecific cues inform of overcrowding that will increase reproductive competition and diminish their reproductive chances.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/physiology', 'Glycoproteins', 'Larva/physiology', '*Pheromones', 'Thoracica/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Lipoproteins']"
29694247,"We subjected podocytes (either differentiated or undifferentiated) to a pulse with stable isotope labeled amino acids for 24, 48, 72 and 96h.","Podocytes are highly specialized, epithelial, postmitotic cells, which maintain the renal filtration barrier. When adapting to considerable metabolic and mechanical stress, podocytes need to accurately maintain their proteome. Immortalized podocyte cell lines are a widely used model for studying podocyte biology in health and disease in vitro. In this study, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the cultured human podocyte proteome in both proliferative and differentiated conditions at a depth of >7000 proteins. Similar to mouse podocytes, human podocyte differentiation involved a shift in proteostasis: undifferentiated podocytes have high expression of proteasomal proteins, whereas differentiated podocytes have high expression of lysosomal proteins. Additional analyses with pulsed stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and protein degradation assays determined protein dynamics and half-lives. These studies unraveled a globally increased stability of proteins in differentiated podocytes. Mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and membrane proteins were stabilized, particularly in differentiated podocytes. Importantly, protein half-lives strongly contributed to protein abundance in each state. These data suggest that regulation of protein turnover of particular cellular functions determines podocyte differentiation, a paradigm involving mitophagy and, potentially, of importance in conditions of increased podocyte stress and damage.-Schroeter, C.

Cells were harvested periodically and LFQ proteomics used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of dark survival.,"Light underneath Antarctic sea-ice is below detectable limits for up to 4 months of the year. The ability of Antarctic sea-ice diatoms to survive this prolonged darkness relies on their metabolic capability. This study is the first to examine the proteome of a prominent sea-ice diatom in response to extended darkness, focusing on the protein-level mechanisms of dark survival. The Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was grown under continuous light or darkness for 120 d. The whole cell proteome was quantitatively analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolic changes that occur during sustained darkness and during recovery under illumination. Enzymes of metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in respiratory processes, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the urea cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain became more abundant in the dark. Within the plastid, carbon fixation halted while the upper sections of the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathways became less active. We have discovered how F. cylindrus utilises an ancient alternative metabolic mechanism that enables its capacity for long-term dark survival. By sustaining essential metabolic processes in the dark, F. cylindrus retains the functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus, ensuring rapid recovery upon re-illumination.","['Antarctic Regions', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Respiration', 'Chlorophyll/metabolism', '*Darkness', 'Diatoms/growth & development/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Electron Transport', '*Ice Cover', 'Light', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Photosynthesis/radiation effects', 'Proteins/metabolism']","['Protein membrane regions', 'Coding region', 'Coding region prediction', 'Count matrix', 'Ion counting', 'Cell type accession', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Atom ID', 'Protein atom', 'Electron density map', 'Transposon prediction', 'Electron microscopy', 'Service discovery', 'Sequence motif discovery', 'Indel detection', 'Light microscopy', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"

Progressive gain of CHH context DNA methylation in transposable elements (TEs) and higher frequency of small RNAs in hypermethylated TEs during seed development suggested a role of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway. Frequency of intragenic TEs was higher in CHH context differentially methylated region (DMR) associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). CG context hyper/hypomethylation within the gene body was observed for most of DMR-associated DEGs in JGK 3 as compared to small-seeded chickpea cultivar (Himchana 1).

Here, we show that nascent chains can even destabilize the translating Escherichia coli ribosome from within. This phenomenon, termed intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD), occurs in response to a special amino acid sequence of the nascent chain, without involving the release or the recycling factors. Typically, a consecutive array of acidic residues and those intermitted by alternating prolines induce IRD. The ribosomal protein bL31, which bridges the two subunits, counteracts IRD, such that only strong destabilizing sequences abort translation in living cells. We found that MgtL, the leader peptide of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter (MgtA), contains a translation-aborting sequence, which sensitizes the ribosome to a decline in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and thereby triggers the MgtA-upregulating genetic scheme. Translation proceeds at an inherent risk of ribosomal destabilization, and nascent chain-ribosome complexes can function as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensor by harnessing IRD.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']","['Phosphorylation sites', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'MRI', 'MRI image', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein interaction format', 'Protein report format', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Protein crystallizability', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Chromosomes', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Structure', 'Relation extraction']"

Furthermore, 47 putative secretory proteins were detected to exhibit acetylated status in RAM.

29476118,"The proliferation of coral reef organisms, such as the key ecological engineers and carbonate producers’ large benthic foraminifera (LBF), greatly relies on the mutual association with photosymbiotic algae. With respect to global change impacts such as ocean warming, evaluating stress and acclimatization responses is highly important, but probing proteins and partitioning host and symbionts are major obstacles for studying LBF. We therefore applied a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to LBF holobionts in order to detect changes in the relative abundances of proteins in response to different thermal-stress scenarios. Subsequent identification allowed for the partial assignment of 1,618 proteins to either foraminiferal host or endosymbiotic diatoms. While single and episodic thermal-stress events only induced minor metabolic impacts, chronic thermal stress diminished photosynthesis-related proteins among the symbionts. Stress response and proteolysis-related proteins increased in abundance, illustrating the extent of damage. In contrast to the symbionts, host homeostasis was maintained through extensive repair mechanisms and high protein turnover. Metabolic pathways were adjusted to the symbiont loss by using alternative energy resources. However, linking proteome to physiological data revealed that resource redistribution impairs growth and certainly other functions that could disturb carbonate production. We show how compartment partitioning can give insights into interactions and stress response mechanisms in photosymbiotic reef-calcifiers.","The proliferation of key marine ecological engineers and carbonate producers often relies on their association with photosymbiotic algae. Evaluating stress responses of these organisms is important to predict their fate under future climate projections. Physiological approaches are limited in their ability to resolve the involved molecular mechanisms and attribute stress effects to the host or symbiont, while probing and partitioning of proteins cannot be applied in organisms where the host and symbiont are small and cannot be physically separated. Here we apply a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to detect changes of proteome composition in the diatom-bearing benthic foraminifera Amphistegina gibbosa experimentally exposed to three thermal-stress scenarios. We developed a workflow for protein extraction from less than ten specimens and simultaneously analysed host and symbiont proteomes. Despite little genomic data for the host, 1,618 proteins could be partially assembled and assigned. The proteomes revealed identical pattern of stress response among stress scenarios as that indicated by physiological measurements, but allowed identification of compartment-specific stress reactions. In the symbiont, stress-response and proteolysis-related proteins were up regulated while photosynthesis-related proteins declined. In contrast, host homeostasis was maintained through chaperone up-regulation associated with elevated proteosynthesis and proteolysis, and the host metabolism shifted to heterotrophy.","['Aquatic Organisms', 'Calcification, Physiologic/genetics', 'Coral Reefs', 'Diatoms/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Ecosystem', 'Foraminifera/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Ontology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Photosynthesis/genetics', 'Proteome/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Symbiosis']","['Model organisms', 'Genetic organisation', 'Organism name', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Translation phase specification', 'Atom ID', 'Protein atom', 'GTrack', 'GSuite', 'BTrack', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation track', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Mathematical model', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"
34666169,Phylogeny of the Two-Clawed Spiders (Dionycha),"The importance of morphology in the phylogenomic era has recently gained attention, but relatively few studies have combined both types of information when inferring phylogenetic relationships. Sanger sequencing legacy data can also be important for understanding evolutionary relationships. The possibility of combining genomic, morphological and Sanger data in one analysis seems compelling, permitting a more complete sampling and yielding a comprehensive view of the evolution of a group. Here we used these three data types to elucidate the systematics and evolution of the Dionycha, a highly diverse group of spiders relatively underrepresented in phylogenetic studies. The datasets were analyzed separately and combined under different inference methods, including a novel approach for analyzing morphological matrices with commonly used evolutionary models. We tested alternative hypotheses of relationships and performed simulations to investigate the accuracy of our findings. We provide a comprehensive and thorough phylogenetic hypothesis for Dionycha that can serve as a robust framework to test hypotheses about the evolution of key characters. We also show that morphological data might have a phylogenetic impact, even when massively outweighed by molecular data. Our approach to analyze morphological data may serve as an alternative to the proposed practice of arbitrarily partitioning, weighting, and choosing between parsimony and stochastic models. As a result of our findings, we propose Trachycosmidae new rank for a group of Australian genera formerly included in Trochanteriidae and Gallieniellidae, and consider Ammoxenidae as a junior synonym of Gnaphosidae. We restore the family rank for Prodidomidae, but transfer the subfamily Molycriinae to Gnaphosidae.

29752379,"Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions. Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO). In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, in a first analysis we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compare in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2,009 and 2,577 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1,834 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1834 proteins, we identified a total of 151 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments). In addition to this preliminary study, we carried out a second experiment using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics to compare protein abundance in cells treated or not with LLO. Four independent biological replicates were included in this second screen in order to perform a robust statistical analyses of downregulated proteins. Among the 2,973 proteins that were quantified in all independent replicates, we identified a total of 149 proteins (5.0 %) for which protein levels were significantly decreased in cells treated with LLO. In contrast to these decreases, only 16 proteins (0.5 %) showed significant increased levels in LLO-treated cells. This result confirmed that LLO remodels the cell proteome mainly by decreasing the level of host targets. To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 149 proteins, we repeated our label-free proteomics analysis on HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority (i.e. 83%) of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we validated that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.","Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions.

Morris Water Maze tests were used to evaluate the effectiveness of rapamycin in APP/PS1 treatment and Western blot analysis was used to verify the proteomics data. The results of Morris Water Maze tests indicated that rapamycin improved the spatial learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice. Proteome analysis identified 100 significantly changed (SC) proteins in hippocampus and 260 in temporal lobe in APP/PS1 mice. Among these, 57 proteins in hippocampus and 167 proteins in temporal lobe were rescued by rapamycin. STRING analysis indicated relatively more complicated protein interactions of AD-related rapamycin rescued proteins in temporal lobe. Pathway analysis showed that SC proteins in APP/PS1 mice were mainly enriched in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins.

30996098,Phospho Proteomics Study from Pan-Tyrosine antibody enrichment and iMac-Fe3+ enrichment for Mouse MLE15 Cell Infected by Influenza Virus,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Adhesin prediction', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein interaction format', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein domains']"

However, the presence of spherical forms with internalized flagella, non-proliferative, non-motile, viable and reversible, denominated pseudocysts, have been commonly observed in this parasite. To understand the mechanisms involved in the formation of pseudocysts, here we performed a mass spectrometry-based high-throughput quantitative proteomics study using a label-free approach and functional assays by biochemical and flow cytometric methods. We observed that morphological transformation of trophozoite to pseudocysts is coupled to (i) a metabolic shift toward a less glycolytic phenotype, (ii) alterations in the abundance of hydrogenosomal iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery; (iii) increased abundance of regulatory particles of the ubiquitin–proteasome system; (iv) significant alterations in proteins involved in adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization; (v) arrest in G2/M phase associated to alterations in the abundance of regulatory proteins of the cell cycle.

A total number of 1845 and 1550 protein groups were identified in the THP-1 macrophages and the corresponding exosomes, respectively.

30988283,The molecular mechanisms regulating the switch between RIPK1 pro-survival and pro-death functions remain poorly understood. We identified Ikkα/β-mediated phosphorylation of RIPK1 as a key mechanism inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity and preventing TNF-mediated RIPK1 kinase-dependent cell death.,"RIPK1 regulates cell death and inflammation through kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. As a scaffold, RIPK1 inhibits caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. As a kinase, RIPK1 paradoxically induces these cell death modalities. The molecular switch between RIPK1 pro-survival and pro-death functions remains poorly understood. We identify phosphorylation of RIPK1 on Ser25 by IKKs as a key mechanism directly inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity and preventing TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death. Mimicking Ser25 phosphorylation (S > D mutation) protects cells and mice from the cytotoxic effect of TNF in conditions of IKK inhibition. In line with their roles in IKK activation, TNF-induced Ser25 phosphorylation of RIPK1 is defective in TAK1- or SHARPIN-deficient cells and restoring phosphorylation protects these cells from TNF-induced death. Importantly, mimicking Ser25 phosphorylation compromises the in vivo cell death-dependent immune control of Yersinia infection, a physiological model of TAK1/IKK inhibition, and rescues the cell death-induced multi-organ inflammatory phenotype of the SHARPIN-deficient mice.","['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism/physiology', 'Immunity/physiology', 'Mice', '*Models, Immunological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Serine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Yersinia', 'Yersinia Infections/immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Kinase name', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction data', 'Veterinary medicine', 'Sequence visualisation', 'Marine biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Version information']"

To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium<sup>5,6</sup> has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences.","['Animals', 'Birds', 'Gene Library', '*Genome', 'Genome Size', 'Genome, Mitochondrial', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sex Chromosomes/genetics', 'Vertebrates/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Clone library', 'Spectral library search', 'Gene ID', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Word size', 'Window size', 'Mitochondria', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Phenotype name', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation', 'Sequence alignment', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Vertebrates', 'Invertebrates']"
34951957,Reuterin in the healthy gut microbiome suppresses colorectal cancer growth through altering redox balance,"Microbial dysbiosis is a colorectal cancer (CRC) hallmark and contributes to inflammation, tumor growth, and therapy response. Gut microbes signal via metabolites, but how the metabolites impact CRC is largely unknown. We interrogated fecal metabolites associated with mouse models of colon tumorigenesis with varying mutational load. We find that microbial metabolites from healthy mice or humans are growth-repressive, and this response is attenuated in mice and patients with CRC. Microbial profiling reveals that Lactobacillus reuteri and its metabolite, reuterin, are downregulated in mouse and human CRC. Reuterin alters redox balance, and reduces proliferation and survival in colon cancer cells. Reuterin induces selective protein oxidation and inhibits ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Exogenous Lactobacillus reuteri restricts colon tumor growth, increases tumor reactive oxygen species, and decreases protein translation in vivo. Our findings indicate that a healthy microbiome and specifically, Lactobacillus reuteri, is protective against CRC through microbial metabolite exchange.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Energy Metabolism', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glyceraldehyde/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Host Microbial Interactions', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Metabolomics/methods', 'Metagenomics/methods', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', '*Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Propane/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Color', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Drug metabolism', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Microbiology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbial ecology', 'GlycoMap ID', 'Protein interactions', 'Microbial collection', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Metabolomics', 'Metagenomics', 'Genomics', 'Metagenomic sequencing', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Protein property', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Protein properties', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Format']"
31474573,Ribosome profiling of GC7/vehicle-treated mouse primary B cells,"Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans.","['Adaptive Immunity/drug effects', 'Age Factors', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects', 'Immunosenescence/*drug effects', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermidine/*pharmacology']","['DNA barcoding', 'Peptide immunogenicity data', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', '2D PAGE image', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunomics', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide annotation', 'Peptide identification', 'Protein modifications', 'Protein interaction data processing', 'Protein post-translational modifications', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

We demonstrate its applicability to mapping of Okazaki fragments without prior size selection and provide insight into the relative contributions of DNA ligase 1 and ligase 3 to Okazaki fragment maturation in human cells.

32501498,"Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is the master regulator of centriole duplication in metazoan organisms. Catalytic activity and protein turnover of PLK4 are tightly coupled in human cells, since changes in PLK4 concentration and catalysis have profound effects on centriole duplication and supernumerary centrosomes, which are associated with aneuploidy and cancer. Recently, PLK4 has been targeted with a variety of small molecule kinase inhibitors exemplified by centrinone, which induces inhibitory effects on PLK4 and can lead to on-target centrosome depletion. Despite this, relatively few PLK4 substrates have been identified unequivocally in human cells, and the extent of PLK4 signalling remains poorly characterised. We report an unbiased mass spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of cellular protein phosphorylation in stable PLK4-expressing human cells exposed to the small molecule inhibitor centrinone. PLK4 phosphorylation was itself sensitive to brief exposure to centrinone, resulting in PLK4 stabilization. A drug-resistant PLK4 mutant (G95R) confirmed several on-target effects of the compound towards PLK4. Using this experimental system, we report hundreds of centrinone-regulated phosphoproteins in U2OS cells, including centrosomal and cell cycle proteins and a variety of likely non cell-cycle substrates. Surprisingly, sequence interrogation of ~300 significantly downregulated phosphoproteins reveals an extensive network of centrinone-sensitive [Ser/Thr]Pro phosphorylation target sequence motifs, which based on our analysis might be either direct or indirect targets of PLK4. In addition, we confirm NMYC and PTPN12 as new PLK4 substrates, both in vitro and in human cells.

35391557,"Gravitational biology and its effects on cancer cells are of great interest, especially today that space is more accessible than ever. Despite advances in space research, little is known about the impact of microgravity on tumor and its biology and data from the literature are often contradictory due to different setup, experimental designs and analyzed time-points. Exploiting the Random Positioning machine we evaluated on pancreatic cancer cells the effects of long-term exposure to simulated microgravity (SMG) performing a large proteomic, lipidomic and transcriptional analysis at 1, 7 and 9 days. Results indicate that SMG affects cellular morphology through a time-dependent activation of “Regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”and “Cdc42” pathways that contribute to the dynamic actin rearrangement involved in the formation of 3D spheroidal structures and in the enhancement of epithelial-to mesenchymal transition. To support energy stress remediation and counteract massive apoptosis activation and cell proliferation inhibition, induced by SMG, tumor cells downregulate the protein translational machinery, and undergo a metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by the activation of HIF-1a and PI3K/Akt pathways. These two pathways pave the way for glucose metabolism encouraging upregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial activity, Tri-carboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid synthesis (rather than B oxidation), suggesting a de novo synthesis of triglycerides involved in the formation of membrane lipid bilayer and signaling mediators. This metabolic plasticity, typical of cancer stem cells, is in accordance with the SMG-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt/NFkB/ERK5/IL-8 signaling axis that significantly upregulates the expression of stem-associated proteins and expansion of cancer stem cells with a more mesenchymal phenotype and improved migratory capability. Altogether, our findings clearly indicate that microgravity induces cancer cell transformation towards the acquisition of cancer stem cell-like features, with a more aggressive and metastatic potential and pave the base for future study of response to anti neoplastic drugs under simulated microgravity.","The impact of the absence of gravity on cancer cells is of great interest, especially today that space is more accessible than ever.

After data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis, phosphopeptides of Nab2, Foxk1, HURP, ERK1/2, NPM, and Hspa4 were selected and quantified by targeted MS using the PRM method. Targeted MS/MS scans were acquired by a time-scheduled inclusion list at a resolution of 70,000, an AGC target of 2e5, an isolation window of 2.0 m/z, a maximum injection time of 500 ms, and a normalized collision energy of 27. Time alignment and relative quantification of the transitions were performed using Skyline software.","The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, governs various cellular processes by phosphorylating a large set of substrates. Although many studies have expanded the number of ERK substrates, it is likely that additional substrates remain to be discovered. Here we have employed a quantitative phosphoproteomic approach to explore novel ERK substrates in NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing a fusion protein between B-Raf and estrogen receptor. Among ERK-dependent phosphorylation targets, we focused on NGFI-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2), forkhead box protein K1 (Foxk1), and Disks large-associated protein 5 (Dlgap5/HURP). Phos-tag SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting confirmed ERK-dependent phosphorylation of these three proteins in cells. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of in vitro kinase assay samples revealed high degrees of phosphorylation of these proteins by active ERK. Furthermore, in-gel digestion of the phosphorylated protein bands from Phos-tag SDS-PAGE followed by LC-MS/MS indicated that active ERK directly phosphorylates the same sites in vitro as those observed in cells. This study demonstrates the usefulness of Phos-tag SDS-PAGE for validation of candidate substrates of protein kinases. SIGNIFICANCE: Label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics identified 1439 phosphopeptides derived from 840 proteins that were significantly increased by ERK activation in mouse fibroblasts. Through gene ontology and pathway analysis, we selected three proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and/or tumorigenesis. The identified phosphorylation sites of these proteins conform to the ERK consensus motif and were directly phosphorylated by active ERK in vitro. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE was useful for detecting ERK-mediated phosphorylation of these substrates both in cells and in vitro.

Common, disease-causing mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity, presenting LRRK2 as an attractive target for drug discovery. Currently, drug development has mainly focused on ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a variety of nanobodies that bind to different LRRK2 domains and inhibit or activate LRRK2 in cells and in in vitro. Importantly, nanobodies were identified that inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity while binding to a site that is topographically distinct from the active site and thus act through an allosteric inhibitory mechanism that does not involve binding to the ATP pocket or even to the kinase domain. Moreover, while certain nanobodies completely inhibit the LRRK2 kinase activity, we also identified nanobodies that specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of Rab protein substrates. Finally, in contrast to current type I kinase inhibitors, the studied kinase-inhibitory nanobodies did not induce LRRK2 microtubule association.

Methods: 90 patients from diverse centers of the “International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders” were included in the. Clinical and molecular metadata were related to the protein abundances in the CSF. Results: Concentrations of four proteins were significantly altered, detected by Mass spectrometry and confirmed by immunoassays. First, decreased levels of Apolipoprotein D were found in severe cases of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Second, low levels of Apolipoprotein H were observed in patients with the severe phenotype of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD), whereas increased concentrations of oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein were found in the same subset of THD patients. Third, decreased levels of Collagen6A3 were observed in treated tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency patients.

Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells can also be divided into subsets that phenotypically mirror each of these effector populations and share expression of key transcription factors and effector cytokines. In this study, we performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling of 11 phenotypically distinct Th and Treg cell subsets sorted from peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Despite their shared phenotypes, we found that mirror Th and Treg subsets were transcriptionally dissimilar and that Treg cell populations showed limited transcriptional diversity compared with Th cells. We identified core transcriptional signatures shared across all Th and Treg cell populations and unique signatures that define each of the Th or Treg populations. Finally, we applied these signatures to bulk Th and Treg RNA-sequencing data and found enrichment of specific Th and Treg cell populations in different human tissues. These results further define the molecular basis for the functional specialization and differentiation of Th and Treg cell populations and provide a new resource for examining Th and Treg specialization in RNA-sequencing data.","['Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'RNA-Seq', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","['Cytometry', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Epistasis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Feature selection', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
33672268,"Using this approach, we obtained phospho-proteomic data on the LATS1 interactome from cells treated with two proapoptotic signals: FAS and etoposide, which both activate LATS kinase activity [28].To identify the LATS1 interactome we transiently expressed GFP-LATS1 in HeLa cells, immunoprecipitated GFP-LATS1 with anti-GFP antibodies and identified the associated proteins using mass-spectrometry. Unspecific binding proteins were discarded by comparing with the control GFP IP.","The Hippo pathway regulates a complex signalling network which mediates several biological functions including cell proliferation, organ size and apoptosis. Several scaffold proteins regulate the crosstalk of the members of the pathway with other signalling pathways and play an important role in the diverse output controlled by this pathway. In this study we have identified the scaffold protein IQGAP1 as a novel interactor of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST2 and LATS1. Our results indicate that IQGAP1 scaffolds MST2 and LATS1 supresses their kinase activity and YAP1-dependent transcription. Additionally, we show that IQGAP1 is a negative regulator of the non-canonical pro-apoptotic pathway and may enable the crosstalk between this pathway and the ERK and AKT signalling modules. Our data also show that bile acids regulate the IQGAP1-MST2-LATS1 signalling module in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which could be necessary for the inhibition of MST2-dependent apoptosis and hepatocyte transformation.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chenodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Serine-Threonine Kinase 3', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Protein p73/metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Proteins', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Kinase name', 'DNA transduction map', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Tumor annotation', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein signature', 'Protein active sites']"
31813610,Kluyveromyces lactis strain:CBS 2105 Genome sequencing and assembly,"Humans have used yeasts to make cheese and kefir for millennia, but the ability to ferment the milk sugar lactose is found in only a few yeast species, of which the foremost is Kluyveromyces lactis [1]. Two genes, LAC12 (lactose permease) and LAC4 (lactase), are sufficient for lactose uptake and hydrolysis to glucose and galactose [2]. Here, we show that these genes have a complex evolutionary history in the genus Kluyveromyces that is likely the result of human activity during domestication. We show that the ancestral Lac12 was bifunctional, able to import both lactose and cellobiose into the cell. These disaccharides were then hydrolyzed by Lac4 in the case of lactose or Cel2 in the case of cellobiose. A second cellobiose transporter, Cel1, was also present ancestrally. In the K. lactis lineage, the ancestral LAC12 and LAC4 were lost and a separate upheaval in the sister species K. marxianus resulted in loss of CEL1 and quadruplication of LAC12. One of these LAC12 genes became neofunctionalized to encode an efficient lactose transporter capable of supporting fermentation, specifically in dairy strains of K. marxianus, where it formed a LAC4-LAC12-CEL2 gene cluster, although another remained a cellobiose transporter. Then, the ability to ferment lactose was acquired very recently by K. lactis var. lactis by introgression of LAC12 and LAC4 on a 15-kb subtelomeric region from a dairy strain of K. marxianus. The genomic history of the LAC genes shows that strong selective pressures were imposed on yeasts by early dairy farmers.","['Cellobiose/genetics/metabolism', 'Domestication', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fermentation/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal/genetics', 'Genome, Fungal/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Kluyveromyces/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Lactose/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny']","['Cell biology', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Statistical calculation', 'Raw CATH domain classification', ""Ensembl ID ('Monodelphis domestica')"", 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Documentation and help', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Phenotype name', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction']"
34012439,Neonatal T helper 17 responses are skewed towards an immunoregulatory interleukin-22 phenotype,"Newborns are frequently affected by mucocutaneous candidiasis. Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","['Age Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Immunomodulation', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']","['Transcription factors and regulatory sites', '2D PAGE image', 'Transcription factor name', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Protein interactions', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Feature selection', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

28635591,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1099/mic.0.000477.].,"Multiple interacting factors affect the performance of engineered biological systems in synthetic biology projects. The complexity of these biological systems means that experimental design should often be treated as a multiparametric optimization problem. However, the available methodologies are either impractical, due to a combinatorial explosion in the number of experiments to be performed, or are inaccessible to most experimentalists due to the lack of publicly available, user-friendly software. Although evolutionary algorithms may be employed as alternative approaches to optimize experimental design, the lack of simple-to-use software again restricts their use to specialist practitioners. In addition, the lack of subsidiary approaches to further investigate critical factors and their interactions prevents the full analysis and exploitation of the biotechnological system. We have addressed these problems and, here, provide a simple-to-use and freely available graphical user interface to empower a broad range of experimental biologists to employ complex evolutionary algorithms to optimize their experimental designs. Our approach exploits a Genetic Algorithm to discover the subspace containing the optimal combination of parameters, and Symbolic Regression to construct a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the experiment to each parameter under investigation. We demonstrate the utility of this method using an example in which the culture conditions for the microbial production of a bioactive human protein are optimized.

31776259,Sleep-wake driven and circadian contributions to daily rhythms in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the murine cortex,"The timing and duration of sleep results from the interaction between a homeostatic sleep-wake-driven process and a periodic circadian process, and involves changes in gene regulation and expression. Unraveling the contributions of both processes and their interaction to transcriptional and epigenomic regulatory dynamics requires sampling over time under conditions of unperturbed and perturbed sleep. We profiled mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility in the cerebral cortex of mice over a 3-d period, including a 6-h sleep deprivation (SD) on day 2. We used mathematical modeling to integrate time series of mRNA expression data with sleep-wake history, which established that a large proportion of rhythmic genes are governed by the homeostatic process with varying degrees of interaction with the circadian process, sometimes working in opposition. Remarkably, SD caused long-term effects on gene-expression dynamics, outlasting phenotypic recovery, most strikingly illustrated by a damped oscillation of most core clock genes, including <i>Arntl</i>/<i>Bmal1</i>, suggesting that enforced wakefulness directly impacts the molecular clock machinery. Chromatin accessibility proved highly plastic and dynamically affected by SD. Dynamics in distal regions, rather than promoters, correlated with mRNA expression, implying that changes in expression result from constitutively accessible promoters under the influence of enhancers or repressors. Serum response factor (SRF) was predicted as a transcriptional regulator driving immediate response, suggesting that SRF activity mirrors the build-up and release of sleep pressure. Our results demonstrate that a single, short SD has long-term aftereffects at the genomic regulatory level and highlights the importance of the sleep-wake distribution to diurnal rhythmicity and circadian processes.","['Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm/*genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', 'Sleep/*genetics', 'Sleep Deprivation/genetics', 'Wakefulness/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Deposition', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Deletion detection']"
31794606,Targeting chronic NFAT activation with calcineurin inhibitors in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common adult lymphoma and can be divided into 2 major molecular subtypes: the germinal center B-cell-like and the aggressive activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Previous studies suggested that chronic B-cell receptor signaling and increased NF-κB activation contribute to ABC DLBCL survival. Here we show that the activity of the transcription factor NFAT is chronically elevated in both DLBCL subtypes. Surprisingly, NFAT activation is independent of B-cell receptor signaling, but mediated by an increased calcium flux and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT. Intriguingly, although NFAT is activated in both DLBCL subtypes, long-term calcineurin inhibition with cyclosporin A or FK506, both clinically approved drugs, triggers potent cytotoxicity specifically in ABC DLBCL cells. The antitumor effects of calcineurin inhibitors are associated with the reduced expression of c-Jun, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10, which were identified as NFAT target genes that are particularly important for the survival of ABC DLBCL. Furthermore, calcineurin blockade synergized with BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibitors in killing ABC DLBCL cells. Collectively, these findings identify constitutive NFAT signaling as a crucial functional driver of ABC DLBCL and highlight calcineurin inhibition as a novel strategy for the treatment of this aggressive lymphoma subtype.","['Calcineurin/*chemistry', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Inhibitor annotation', 'Spectrum calculation', 'Linkage disequilibrium calculation', 'Calculation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein sequence', 'Protein sequences', 'Sequence', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Cell culture collection', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell and tissue culture']"

These strains were characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Based on cellular morphology and biochemical criteria the two isolates were tentatively assigned to the genus Corynebacterium, although they did not correspond to any recognized species. The predominant fatty acids were a mix of C18:2omega6,9c and anteiso-C18:0 (32.1% of the total), C16:0 (26.3%) and C18:1omega9c (22.5%) for strain 5402485T and C18:1omega9c (36.4%), C17:1omega9c (27.1%) and C16:0 (10.9%) for strain 5401744T.

33927382,Comparison of gene expression in Exaiptasia pallida aposymbiotic cells and cells containing Microchloropsis gaditana,"Alveolata comprises diverse taxa of single-celled eukaryotes, many of which are renowned for their ability to live inside animal cells. Notable examples are apicomplexan parasites and dinoflagellate symbionts, the latter of which power coral reef ecosystems. Although functionally distinct, they evolved from a common, free-living ancestor and must evade their host's immune response for persistence. Both the initial cellular events that gave rise to this intracellular lifestyle and the role of host immune modulation in coral-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis are poorly understood. Here, we use a comparative approach in the cnidarian endosymbiosis model Aiptasia, which re-establishes endosymbiosis with free-living dinoflagellates every generation. We find that uptake of microalgae is largely indiscriminate, but non-symbiotic microalgae are expelled by vomocytosis, while symbionts induce host cell innate immune suppression and form a lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1-positive niche. We demonstrate that exogenous immune stimulation results in symbiont expulsion and, conversely, inhibition of canonical Toll-like receptor signalling enhances infection of host animals. Our findings indicate that symbiosis establishment is dictated by local innate immune suppression, to circumvent expulsion and promote niche formation. This work provides insight into the evolution of the cellular immune response and key steps involved in mediating endosymbiotic interactions.","['Animals', 'Anthozoa/*immunology/*parasitology/physiology', 'Coral Reefs', 'Dinoflagellida/*physiology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Signal Transduction', '*Symbiosis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"
32236527,Transcriptome profiling of purified red blood cells from Nxf1 mutant and control mice [Erythrocytes],"In eukaryotic cells, messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they are translated. The highly conserved protein nuclear RNA export factor1 (Nxf1) is an important mediator of this process. Although studies in yeast and in human cell lines have shed light on the biochemical mechanisms of Nxf1 function, its contribution to mammalian physiology is less clear. Several groups have identified recurrent NXF1 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), placing it alongside several RNA-metabolism factors (including SF3B1, XPO, RPS15) whose dysregulation is thought to contribute to CLL pathogenesis. We report here an allelic series of germline point mutations in murine Nxf1. Mice heterozygous for these loss-of-function Nxf1 mutations exhibit thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, together with milder hematological defects. This is primarily caused by cell-intrinsic defects in the survival of platelets and peripheral lymphocytes, which are sensitized to intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast, Nxf1 mutations have almost no effect on red blood cell homeostasis. Comparative transcriptome analysis of platelets, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes from Nxf1-mutant mice shows that, in response to impaired Nxf1 function, the cytoplasmic representation of transcripts encoding regulators of RNA metabolism is altered in a unique, lineage-specific way. Thus, blood cell lineages exhibit differential requirements for Nxf1-mediated global mRNA export.","['Animals', 'Germ Cells', '*Lymphopenia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Thrombocytopenia/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'cel', 'Keyword', 'CellML', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'Protein report', 'Nucleic acid report', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA central ID', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"
32154791,Post-sepsis immunosuppression depends on NKT cell regulation of mTOR/IFN-gamma in NK cells,"As treatment of the early, inflammatory phase of sepsis improves, post-sepsis immunosuppression and secondary infection have increased in importance. How early inflammation drives immunosuppression remains unclear. Although IFN-γ typically helps microbial clearance, we found that increased plasma IFN-γ in early clinical sepsis was associated with the later development of secondary Candida infection. Consistent with this observation, we found that exogenous IFN-γ suppressed macrophage phagocytosis of zymosan in vivo, and antibody blockade of IFN-γ after endotoxemia improved survival of secondary candidemia. Transcriptomic analysis of innate lymphocytes during endotoxemia suggested that NKT cells drove IFN-γ production by NK cells via mTORC1. Activation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells with glycolipid antigen drove immunosuppression. Deletion of iNKT cells in Cd1d-/- mice or inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin reduced immunosuppression and susceptibility to secondary Candida infection. Thus, although rapamycin is typically an immunosuppressive medication, in the context of sepsis, rapamycin has the opposite effect. These results implicated an NKT cell/mTOR/IFN-γ axis in immunosuppression following endotoxemia or sepsis. In summary, in vivo iNKT cells activated mTORC1 in NK cells to produce IFN-γ, which worsened macrophage phagocytosis, clearance of secondary Candida infection, and mortality.","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD1d/genetics/immunology', 'Candida/immunology', 'Candidiasis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Sepsis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'IDAT', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Natural product identification', 'Natural language processing', 'Cell line name', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Kinase name']"

A quantitative understanding of how motif lexicons influence dynamic regulatory activity has been elusive due to the combinatorial nature of the cis-regulatory code. To address this, we undertook multiomic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103 dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed genes, then applied an interpretable deep-learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This analysis framework identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter assay analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic. Variants linked to human polygenic skin disease were enriched in these time-dependent combinatorial motif rules.

34305890,Global transcriptomics reveals specialized roles for splicing regulatory proteins in the macrophage innate immune response,"Pathogen sensing <i>via</i> pattern recognition receptors triggers massive reprogramming of macrophage gene expression. While the signaling cascades and transcription factors that activate these responses are well-known, the role of post-transcriptional RNA processing in modulating innate immune gene expression remains understudied. Given their crucial role in regulating pre-mRNA splicing and other RNA processing steps, we hypothesized that members of the SR/hnRNP protein families regulate innate immune gene expression in distinct ways. We analyzed steady state gene expression and alternatively spliced isoform production in ten SR/hnRNP knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell lines following infection with the bacterial pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella</i>). We identified thousands of transcripts whose abundance is increased or decreased by SR/hnRNP knockdown in macrophages. Notably, we observed that SR and hnRNP proteins influence expression of different genes in uninfected versus <i>Salmonella</i>-infected macrophages, suggesting functionalization of these proteins upon pathogen sensing. Likewise, we found that knockdown of SR/hnRNPs promoted differential isoform usage (DIU) for thousands of macrophage transcripts and that these alternative splicing changes were distinct in uninfected and <i>Salmonella</i>-infected macrophages. Finally, having observed a surprising degree of similarity between the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DIUs in hnRNP K and U knockdown macrophages, we found that hnRNP K and U knockdown macrophages are both more restrictive to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), while hnRNP K knockdown macrophages are more permissive to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium. Based on these findings, we conclude that many innate immune genes evolved to rely on one or more SR/hnRNPs to ensure the proper magnitude of their induction, supporting a model wherein pre-mRNA splicing is critical for regulating innate immune gene expression and controlling infection outcomes in macrophages <i>ex vivo</i>.","['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Computational Biology/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Macrophages/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Salmonella Infections/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/immunology', '*Transcriptome']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'nucleotide', 'Proteins', 'Protein-nucleic acid interactions', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'raw', 'Raw sequence', 'cel', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

14755723,Acute Quadriplegic Myopathy,"Acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM; also called ""critical illness myopathy"") shows acute muscle wasting and weakness and is experienced by some patients with severe systemic illness, often associated with administration of corticosteroids and/or neuroblocking agents. Key aspects of AQM include muscle atrophy and myofilament loss. Although these features are shared with neurogenic atrophy, myogenic atrophy in AQM appears mechanistically distinct from neurogenic atrophy. Using muscle biopsies from AQM, neurogenic atrophy, and normal controls, we show that both myogenic and neurogenic atrophy share induction of myofiber-specific ubiquitin/proteosome pathways (eg, atrogin-1). However, AQM patient muscle showed a specific strong induction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/MAPK pathways. Atrophic AQM myofibers showed coexpression of TGF-beta receptors, p38 MAPK, c-jun, and c-myc, including phosphorylated active forms, and these same fibers showed apoptotic features. Our data suggest a model of AQM pathogenesis in which stress stimuli (sepsis, corticosteroids, pH imbalance, osmotic imbalance) converge on the TGF-beta pathway in myofibers. The acute stimulation of the TGF-beta/MAPK pathway, coupled with the inactivity-induced atrogin-1/proteosome pathway, leads to the acute muscle loss seen in AQM patients.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Muscular Atrophy/etiology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscular Diseases/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Quadriplegia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plotting', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', '18O labeling', 'Metabolic labeling', 'Sequence feature label', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'PHYLIP format', 'Molecular property', ""Ensembl ID ('Mus musculus')"", 'Rare diseases', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Quadruplex formation site detection', 'qual', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
15336692,Skeletal muscle cell fusion time course,"To study pathways involved in human skeletal myogenesis, we profiled gene expression in human primary myoblast cells derived from three individuals using both oligonucleotide and cDNA microarrays. Following stringent statistical testing (false-positive rate 0.4%), we identified 146 genes differentially expressed over time. Interestingly, 86 of these genes have not been reported to be involved in myogenesis in mouse cell lines. This demonstrates the additional value of human primary cell cultures in the study of muscle differentiation. Many of the identified genes play a role in muscle regeneration, indicating the close relationship of this process with muscle development. In addition, we found overlap with expression profiling studies in muscle from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, confirming ongoing muscle regeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Further study of these genes can bring new insights into the process of muscle differentiation, and they are candidate genes for neuromuscular disorders with an as yet unidentified cause.","['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Desmin/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Laminin/genetics/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myoblasts, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5', 'Myosins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Protein design', 'Design', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecules', 'Data mining', 'Text mining', 'Text mining report', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein alignment', 'Protein domains', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor accession']"
16816428,No accelerated rate of protein evolution in male biased Drosophila pseudoobscura genes,"Sexually dimorphic traits are often subject to diversifying selection. Genes with a male-biased gene expression also are probably affected by sexual selection and have a high rate of protein evolution. We used SAGE to measure sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Consistent with previous results from D. melanogaster, a larger number of genes were male biased (402 genes) than female biased (138 genes). About 34% of the genes changed the sex-related expression pattern between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Combining gene expression with protein divergence between both species, we observed a striking difference in the rate of evolution for genes with a male-biased gene expression in one species only. Contrary to expectations, D. pseudoobscura genes in this category showed no accelerated rate of protein evolution, while D. melanogaster genes did. If sexual selection is driving molecular evolution of male-biased genes, our data imply a radically different selection regime in D. pseudoobscura.","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes/chemistry', 'Drosophila/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Insect', 'Genomic Library', 'Insect Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Sex Factors', 'Synteny']","['Comparison matrix (amino acid)', 'DNA substitution model', 'Comparison matrix', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular data', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Clone library', 'Genomics', 'Annotation track', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'MAT', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Synthetic biology']"

Seven of these patients were positive for the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene and 7 were negative. We used a cDNA platform containing a large majority of probes derived from muscle tissues. The comparison of transcription profiles of tumor samples with fetal skeletal muscle identified 171 differentially expressed genes common to all ARMS patients. The functional classification analysis of altered genes led to the identification of a group of transcripts (LGALS1, BIN1) that may be relevant for the tumorigenic processes. The muscle-specific microarray platform was able to distinguish PAX3-FKHR positive and negative ARMS through the expression pattern of a limited number of genes (RAC1, CFL1, CCND1, IGFBP2) that might be biologically relevant for the different clinical behavior and aggressiveness of the 2 ARMS subtypes.

15479839,Host cell gene expression late during cytomegalovirus infection,"Replication of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) depends on host cell gene products working in conjunction with viral functions and leads to a dramatic dysregulation of cell cycle gene expression. Comprehensive transcriptional profiling was used to identify pathways most dramatically modulated by CMV at late times during infection and to determine the extent to which expression of the viral chemokine receptor US28 contributed to modulating cellular gene expression. Cells infected with the AD169 strain of virus or a fully replication competent US28-deficient derivative (RV101) were profiled throughout the late phase of infection (50, 72, and 98 h postinfection). Although sensitive statistical analysis showed striking global changes in transcript levels in infected cells compared to uninfected cells, the expression of US28 did not contribute to these alterations. CMV infection resulted in lower levels of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, and adhesion proteins, together with small GTPases and apoptosis regulators, and in higher levels of transcripts encoding cell cycle, DNA replication, energy production, and inflammation-related gene products. Surprisingly, a large number of cellular transcripts encoding mitosis-related proteins were upmodulated at late times in infection, and these were associated with the formation of abnormal mitotic spindles and the appearance of pseudomitotic cells. These data extend our understanding of how broadly CMV alters the regulation of host cell cycle gene products and highlight the establishment of a mitosis-like environment in the absence of cellular DNA replication as important for viral replication and maturation.","['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'DNA Replication', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, cdc', 'Humans', 'Integrins/genetics', 'Metalloproteases/genetics', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Mitosis', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']","['Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Cytometry', 'Virus identifier', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Matrix', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Multiomics', 'Integrated gene prediction', 'Ion counting', 'Protein databases', 'Metabolic disease', 'Mitochondria', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Virus annotation']"
16397762,Identification of new target genes of TOR during growth in MDN,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is an essential regulator of cell growth in eukaryotic cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TOR controls the expression of many genes involved in a wide array of distinct nutrient-responsive metabolic pathways. By exploring the TOR pathway under different growth conditions, we have identified novel TOR-regulated genes, including genes required for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis as well as lysine biosynthesis (LYS genes). We show that TOR-dependent control of LYS gene expression occurs independently from previously identified LYS gene regulators and is instead coupled to cAMP-regulated protein kinase A (PKA). Additional genome-wide expression analyses reveal that TOR and PKA coregulate LYS gene expression in a pattern that is remarkably similar to genes within the ribosomal protein and ""Ribi"" regulon genes required for ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, this pattern of coregulation is distinct from other clusters of TOR/PKA coregulated genes, which includes genes involved in fermentation as well as aerobic respiration, suggesting that control of gene expression by TOR and PKA involves multiple modes of crosstalk. Our results underscore how multiple signaling pathways, general growth conditions, as well as the availability of specific nutrients contribute to the maintenance of appropriate patterns of gene activity in yeast.","['Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Lysine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']","['Protein pKa calculation', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein threading', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Large-scale soybean cDNA microarrays representing approx. 18 000 genes or c. 30% of the soybean genome were compared at 6 and 12 h post-application of aphids. In a separate experiment utilizing clip cages, expression of three defense-related genes were examined at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h in both cultivars by quantitative real-time PCR. One hundred and forty genes showed specific responses for resistance; these included genes related to cell wall, defense, DNA/RNA, secondary metabolism, signaling and other processes. When an extended time period of sampling was investigated, earlier and greater induction of three defense-related genes was observed in the resistant cultivar; however, the induction declined after 24 or 48 h in the resistant cultivar but continued to increase in the susceptible cultivar after 24 h. Aphid-challenged resistant plants showed rapid differential gene expression patterns similar to the incompatible response induced by avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. Five genes were identified as differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the absence of aphids.","['Animals', 'Aphids/*physiology', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genotype', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plant Diseases/genetics/microbiology', 'Pseudomonas syringae/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soybeans/*genetics/metabolism/microbiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Lipids', 'Nucleic acids', 'Ensembl ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
15470261,Sulfur Starvation in Chlamydomonas,"Responses of photosynthetic organisms to sulfur starvation include (i) increasing the capacity of the cell for transporting and/or assimilating exogenous sulfate, (ii) restructuring cellular features to conserve sulfur resources, and (iii) modulating metabolic processes and rates of cell growth and division. We used microarray analyses to obtain a genome-level view of changes in mRNA abundances in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during sulfur starvation. The work confirms and extends upon previous findings showing that sulfur deprivation elicits changes in levels of transcripts for proteins that help scavenge sulfate and economize on the use of sulfur resources. Changes in levels of transcripts encoding members of the light-harvesting polypeptide family, such as LhcSR2, suggest restructuring of the photosynthetic apparatus during sulfur deprivation. There are also significant changes in levels of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in metabolic processes (e.g., carbon metabolism), intracellular proteolysis, and the amelioration of oxidative damage; a marked and sustained increase in mRNAs for a putative vanadium chloroperoxidase and a peroxiredoxin may help prolong survival of C. reinhardtii during sulfur deprivation. Furthermore, many of the sulfur stress-regulated transcripts (encoding polypeptides associated with sulfate uptake and assimilation, oxidative stress, and photosynthetic function) are not properly regulated in the sac1 mutant of C. reinhardtii, a strain that dies much more rapidly than parental cells during sulfur deprivation. Interestingly, sulfur stress elicits dramatic changes in levels of transcripts encoding putative chloroplast-localized chaperones in the sac1 mutant but not in the parental strain. These results suggest various strategies used by photosynthetic organisms during acclimation to nutrient-limited growth.","['Animals', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genes, Protozoan', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protozoan Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Protozoan/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfur/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
16823445,Stability of meiosis-specific messenger RNA provides a novel paradigm for the regulation of meiosis,"Much remains unknown about the molecular regulation of meiosis. Here we show that meiosis-specific transcripts are selectively removed if expressed during vegetative growth in fission yeast. These messenger RNAs contain a cis-acting region--which we call the DSR--that confers this removal via binding to a YTH-family protein Mmi1. Loss of Mmi1 function severely impairs cell growth owing to the untimely expression of meiotic transcripts. Microarray analysis reveals that at least a dozen such meiosis-specific transcripts are eliminated by the DSR-Mmi1 system. Mmi1 remains in the form of multiple nuclear foci during vegetative growth. At meiotic prophase these foci precipitate to a single focus, which coincides with the dot formed by the master meiosis-regulator Mei2. A meiotic arrest due to the loss of the Mei2 dot is released by a reduction in Mmi1 activity. We propose that Mei2 turns off the DSR-Mmi1 system by sequestering Mmi1 to the dot and thereby secures stable expression of meiosis-specific transcripts.","['Meiosis/*genetics', 'Mitosis/genetics', 'Prophase', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*cytology/*genetics/growth & development', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Mitochondria', 'Phasing', 'Translation phase specification', 'Protein property', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Protein sequence cleavage', 'Protein cleavage site prediction']"

Gastric cell lines have been widely used as the model to study the genetics, pharmacology and biochemistry of gastric cancers. Here we describe a comprehensive survey of the gene expression profiles of 12 gastric carcinoma cell lines, using cDNA microarray with 43 000 clones. For comparison, we also explored the gene expression patterns of 15 cell lines derived from lymphoid, endothelial, stromal and other epithelial cancers. Expression levels of specific genes were validated through comparison to protein expression by immunohistochemistry using cell block arrays. We found sets of genes whose expression corresponds to the molecular signature of each cell type. In the gastric cancer cell lines, apart from genes that are highly expressed corresponding to their common epithelial origin from the gastrointestinal tract, we found marked heterogeneity among the gene expression patterns of these cell lines. Some of the heterogeneity may reflect their underlying molecular characteristics or specific differentiation program. Two putative gastric carcinoma cell lines were found to be B-cell lymphoma, and another one had no epithelial specific gene expression and hence was of doubtful epithelial origin. These cell lines should no longer be used in gastric carcinoma research.

17696994,R6/1 brain hemisphere time series gene expression,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegeneration that causes a severe progressive illness and early death. Several animal models of the disease have been generated carrying the causative mutation and these have shown that one of the earliest molecular signs of the disease process is a substantial transcriptional deficit. We examined the alterations in brain gene expression in the R6/1 mouse line over the course of the development of phenotypic signs from 18 to 27 weeks. Changes in R6/1 mice were similar to those previously reported in R6/2 mice, and gene ontology analysis shows that pathways related to intracellular and electrical signaling are altered among downregulated genes and lipid biosynthesis and RNA processes among upregulated genes. The R6/1 mice showed deficits in rotarod performance, locomotor activity and exploratory behavior over the time-course. We have correlated the alterations in gene expression with changes in behavior seen in the mice and find that few alterations in gene expression correlate with all behavioral changes but rather that different subsets of the changes are uniquely correlated with one behavior only. This indicates that multiple behavioral tasks assessing different behavioral domains are likely to be necessary in therapeutic trials in mouse models of HD.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Huntington Disease/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Motor Activity/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Recognition, Psychology', 'Reflex, Startle']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Strain data format', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Mouse clinic', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain accession', 'CT', 'GPCR coupling selectivity prediction', 'Active site prediction', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Format detection', 'Prediction and recognition', 'Fold recognition', 'Turtle']"
16434483,Molecular pathways involved in neuronal degeneration of polyglutamine mouse models,"Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belong to a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in corresponding proteins. Transcriptional alteration is a unifying feature of polyQ disorders; however, the relationship between polyQ-induced gene expression deregulation and degenerative processes remains unclear. R6/2 and R7E mouse models of HD and SCA7, respectively, present a comparable retinal degeneration characterized by progressive reduction of electroretinograph activity and important morphological changes of rod photoreceptors. The retina, which is a simple central nervous system tissue, allows correlating functional, morphological and molecular defects. Taking advantage of comparing polyQ-induced degeneration in two retina models, we combined gene expression profiling and molecular biology techniques to decipher the molecular pathways underlying polyQ expansion toxicity. We show that R7E and R6/2 retinal phenotype strongly correlates with loss of expression of a large cohort of genes specifically involved in phototransduction function and morphogenesis of differentiated rod photoreceptors. Accordingly, three key transcription factors (Nrl, Crx and Nr2e3) controlling rod differentiation genes, hence expression of photoreceptor specific traits, are down-regulated. Interestingly, other transcription factors known to cause inhibitory effects on photoreceptor differentiation when mis-expressed, such as Stat3, are aberrantly re-activated. Thus, our results suggest that independently from the protein context, polyQ expansion overrides the control of neuronal differentiation and maintenance, thereby causing dysfunction and degeneration.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Indoles', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nerve Degeneration/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurons/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retina/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Laboratory techniques', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Light microscopy', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Alignment', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code']"
16307366,Histone acetylation during seed germination,"Histone acetylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression in plants and eukaryotes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones, which is associated with the repression of gene expression. To study the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression during seed germination, trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was used to treat imbibing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. GeneChip arrays were used to show that TSA induces up-regulation of 45 genes and down-regulation of 27 genes during seed germination. Eight TSA-up-regulated genes were selected for further analysis - RAB18, RD29B, ATEM1, HSP70 and four late embryogenesis abundant protein genes (LEA). A gene expression time course shows that these eight genes are expressed at high levels in the dry seed and repressed upon seed imbibition at an exponential rate. In the presence of TSA, the onset of repression of the eight genes is not affected but the final level of repressed expression is elevated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and HDAC assays show that there is a transient histone deacetylation event during seed germination at 1 day after imbibition, which serves as a key developmental signal that affects the repression of the eight genes.","['Acetylation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arabidopsis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Germination', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Structure determination', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Recombination detection', 'Histogram', 'Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Nucleic acids', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic engineering', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'Protein complex', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"
15268757,Comparison of Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome fibroblast cell lines to control fibroblast cell lines,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disease with widespread phenotypic features resembling premature aging. HGPS was recently shown to be caused by dominant mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the in-frame deletion of 50 amino acids near the carboxyl terminus of the encoded lamin A protein. Children with this disease typically succumb to myocardial infarction or stroke caused by severe atherosclerosis at an average age of 13 years. To elucidate further the molecular pathogenesis of this disease, we compared the gene expression patterns of three HGPS fibroblast cell strains heterozygous for the LMNA mutation with three normal, age-matched cell strains. We defined a set of 361 genes (1.1% of the approximately 33,000 genes analysed) that showed at least a 2-fold, statistically significant change. The most prominent categories encode transcription factors and extracellular matrix proteins, many of which are known to function in the tissues severely affected in HGPS.

Thus, at the gene expression level, HGPS shows the hallmarks of a developmental disorder affecting mesodermal and mesenchymal cell lineages.

34847078,Anakinra restores cellular proteostasis by coupling mitochondrial redox balance to autophagy,"Autophagy selectively degrades aggregation-prone misfolded proteins caused by defective cellular proteostasis. However, the complexity of autophagy may prevent the full appreciation of how its modulation could be used as a therapeutic strategy in disease management. Here, we define a molecular pathway through which recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) affects cellular proteostasis independently from the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). Anakinra promoted H2O2-driven autophagy through a xenobiotic sensing pathway involving the aryl hydrocarbon receptor that, activated through the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1-kynurenine pathway, transcriptionally activated NADPH oxidase 4 independent of the IL-1R1. By coupling the mitochondrial redox balance to autophagy, anakinra improved the dysregulated proteostasis network in murine and human cystic fibrosis. We anticipate that anakinra may represent a therapeutic option in addition to its IL-1R1-dependent antiinflammatory properties by acting at the intersection of mitochondrial oxidative stress and autophagy with the capacity to restore conditions in which defective proteostasis leads to human disease.","['Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proteostasis/*drug effects']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'protein', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mitochondria', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Epistasis', 'Proteome', 'Protein analysis']"
34997092,Cortical diurnal rhythms remain intact with microglial depletion,"Microglia are subject to change in tandem with the endogenously generated biological oscillations known as our circadian rhythm. Studies have shown microglia harbor an intrinsic molecular clock which regulates diurnal changes in morphology and influences inflammatory responses. In the adult brain, microglia play an important role in the regulation of condensed extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs), and it has been suggested that PNNs are also regulated in a circadian and diurnal manner. We sought to determine whether microglia mediate the diurnal regulation of PNNs via CSF1R inhibitor dependent microglial depletion in C57BL/6J mice, and how the absence of microglia might affect cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms. While we observe diurnal differences in microglial morphology, where microglia are most ramified at the onset of the dark phase, we do not find diurnal differences in PNN intensity. However, PNN intensity increases across many brain regions in the absence of microglia, supporting a role for microglia in the regulation of PNNs. Here, we also show that cortical diurnal gene expression rhythms are intact, with no cycling gene changes without microglia. These findings demonstrate a role for microglia in the maintenance of PNNs, but not in the maintenance of diurnal rhythms.","['Animals', '*Brain Waves/drug effects', '*Circadian Rhythm/drug effects/genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nerve Net/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Organic Chemicals/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Somatosensory Cortex/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'EM Micrograph', 'Microbiology', 'RNA annotation format', 'NET', 'Helical net', 'Pathway or network', 'Compound name', 'Chemical data format', 'Chemical name (ChEBI)', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"
35081333,Transcriptional profiling of dorsal striatum in 1-year-old WT mice and Ash1l heterozygous mice,"ASD-associated genes are enriched for synaptic proteins and epigenetic regulators. How those chromatin modulators establish ASD traits have remained unknown. We find haploinsufficiency of Ash1l causally induces anxiety and autistic-like behavior, including repetitive behavior, and alters social behavior. Specific depletion of Ash1l in forebrain induces similar ASD-associated behavioral defects. While the learning ability remains intact, the discrimination ability of Ash1l mutant mice is reduced. Mechanistically, deletion of Ash1l in neurons induces excessive synapses due to the synapse pruning deficits, especially during the post-learning period. Dysregulation of synaptic genes is detected in Ash1l mutant brain. Specifically, Eph receptor A7 is downregulated in Ash1l<sup>+/-</sup> mice through accumulating EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in its gene body. Importantly, increasing activation of EphA7 in Ash1l<sup>+/-</sup> mice by supplying its ligand, ephrin-A5, strongly promotes synapse pruning and rescues discrimination deficits. Our results suggest that Ash1l haploinsufficiency is a highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, resulting from synapse pruning deficits.","['Animals', '*Autism Spectrum Disorder/genetics/metabolism', '*Autistic Disorder/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, EphA1']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Spectrum', 'Mass spectrum', 'CD spectra', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Nc statistic', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

PARK2 mutations cause early-onset forms of PD. PARK2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, that can selectively translocate to dysfunctional mitochondria to promote their removal by autophagy. However, Parkin knockout (KO) mice do not display signs of neurodegeneration. To assess Parkin function in vivo, we utilized a mouse model that accumulates dysfunctional mitochondria caused by an accelerated generation of mtDNA mutations (Mutator mice). In the absence of Parkin, dopaminergic neurons in Mutator mice degenerated causing an L-DOPA reversible motor deficit. Other neuronal populations were unaffected. Phosphorylated ubiquitin was increased in the brains of Mutator mice, indicating PINK1-Parkin activation. Parkin loss caused mitochondrial dysfunction and affected the pathogenicity but not the levels of mtDNA somatic mutations. A systemic loss of Parkin synergizes with mitochondrial dysfunction causing dopaminergic neuron death modeling PD pathogenic processes.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Dopaminergic Neurons/drug effects/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Levodopa/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondrial Diseases/genetics/*pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Substantia Nigra/drug effects/*pathology', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']","['Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mitochondria', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein alignment', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Protein databases', 'Protein data']"
34967414,The Spt6-tSH2 domain coordinates functional transitions of the RNA Polymerase II CTD during initiation and elongation.,"The conserved transcription elongation factor Spt6 makes several contacts with the RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) complex, including a high-affinity interaction between the Spt6 tandem SH2 domain (Spt6-tSH2) and phosphorylated residues of the Rpb1 subunit in the linker between the catalytic core and the C-terminal domain (CTD) heptad repeats. This interaction contributes to generic localization of Spt6, but we show here that it also has gene-specific roles. Disrupting the interface affected transcription start site selection at a subset of genes whose expression is regulated by this choice, and this was accompanied by changes in a distinct pattern of Spt6 accumulation at these sites. Splicing efficiency was also diminished, as was apparent progression through introns that encode snoRNAs. Chromatin-mediated repression was impaired, and a distinct role in maintaining +1 nucleosomes was identified, especially at ribosomal protein genes. The Spt6-tSH2:Rpb1 interface therefore has both genome-wide functions and local roles at subsets of genes where dynamic decisions regarding initiation, transcript processing, or termination are made. We propose that the interaction modulates the availability or activity of the core elongation and histone chaperone functions of Spt6, contributing to coordination between RNAPII and its accessory factors as varying local conditions call for dynamic responses.","['Binding Sites', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Chaperones/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA Polymerase II/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']","['Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Operon', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Structure', 'Relation extraction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein domains', 'Gene family report', 'Homology modelling']"

In this study, we performed RNA sequencing analysis to reveal transcriptomic profiles of the ACC in a rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. A total of 1628 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing sham-operated rats with rats of 12 hours, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery, respectively. Although these inflammatory-related DEGs were generally increased after CCI, different kinetics of time-series expression were observed with the development of neuropathic pain affection. Specifically, the expression of <i>Ccl5, Cxcl9</i> and <i>Cxcl13</i> continued to increase following CCI. The expression of <i>Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl6</i>, and <i>Ccl7</i> were initially upregulated after CCI and subsequently decreased after 12 hours. Similarly, the expression of <i>Rac2, Cd68, Icam-1, Ptprc, Itgb2</i>, and <i>Fcgr2b</i> increased after 12 hours but reduced after 1 day. However, the expression of the above genes increased again 7 days after CCI, when the neuropathic pain affection had developed. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment and interaction network analyses further showed a high connectivity degree among these chemokine targeting genes. Similar expressional changes in these genes were found in the rat spinal dorsal horn responsible for nociception processing. Taken together, our results indicated chemokines and their targeting genes in the ACC may be differentially involved in the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain affection. These genes may be a target for not only the nociception but also the pain affection following nerve injury.","['Animals', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gyrus Cinguli/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neuralgia/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve/*injuries/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'MAT', 'Pain medicine', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Tree dating']"
27590702,"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a thermally dimorphic fungus, is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that is widespread in Latin America. P. brasiliensis infection occurs when conidia or mycelial fragments are inhaled by the host, which causes these cells to transition to the yeast form. The development of disease requires conidia inside host alveoli to differentiate into yeast cells in a temperature-dependent manner. This fungus is a facultative intracellular pathogen able to survive and replicate inside non-activated macrophages. Therefore, the survival of P. brasiliensis inside the host depends on the ability to adapt to oxidative stress induced by immune cells, especially alveolar macrophages. For several years, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were only associated with pathological processes. Currently, a plethora of roles for ROS in cell signaling have emerged. We have previously reported that low ROS concentrations cause cell proliferation in the human pathogenic fungus P. brasiliensis. In the present report, we investigated the influence of phosphorylation events in that process. Using a mass spectrometry-based approach, we mapped 440 phosphorylation sites in 230 P. brasiliensis proteins and showed that phosphorylation at different sites determines fungal responses to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we described, for the first time, the presence of a two-component signal transduction system in P. brasiliensis. These findings will help us to understand the phosphorylation events involved in the oxidative stress response.","Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a thermally dimorphic fungus, is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that is widespread in Latin America.

A role for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in this process is unknown. Integrating MS-proteomics and metabolic modeling revealed that FAO increases when ECs cultured on matrigel are assembled into a fully formed network. Inhibition of CPT1A in ECs, a limiting enzyme in FAO, results in disruption of this network. Acute CPT1A inhibition reduces cellular ATP levels and oxygen consumption, which can be restored replenishing the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAc). Phosphoproteomic changes upon acute CPT1A inhibition evoked those triggered by thrombin, a potent inducer of EC permeability through calcium signaling.

Acute CPT1A inhibition reduces cellular ATP levels and oxygen consumption, which are restored by replenishing the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Remarkably, global phosphoproteomic changes measured upon acute CPT1A inhibition pinpointed altered calcium signaling. Indeed, CPT1A inhibition increases intracellular calcium oscillations.

Peptides were identified using in-house Mascot software (Matrixscience) and searched against genomic and transcriptomic databases. 692 spots were picked. Mascot analysis resulted in a total of 476 spots (69%) with a set of 490 proteins identified. These data provide experimental evidence for R. prolixus proteins that were predicted by genome and transcriptome. These proteomic data, together with transcriptomic and genomic information, will contribute in the comprehension of the physiology of R. prolixus midgut.","Rhodnius prolixus is an important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, an illness that affects 20% of Latin America population. The obligatory course of the parasite in the vector digestive tract has made it an important target for investigation in order to control the parasite transmission and thus interrupt its biological cycle in the insect vector. Therefore, an insight into the vector midgut physiology is valuable for insect control as well as to provide potential novel targets for drugs and vaccines development and thus disease treatment. In this study, the first 2DE map of R. prolixus anterior midgut is described. Proteins were separated by 2DE and analyzed by nano-LC MS/MS. The results yielded 489 proteins from 475 spots. These proteins were classified into 28 functional groups and their physiological roles in the insect midgut are discussed.

25700275,"Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) were surface-sterilized (using 75 % ethanol) and sown on Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.7) supplemented with 3 mM morpholinoethane sulfonic acid, solidified with 1% (w/v) agar and stratified at 4 °C for 48 h. Petri dishes were covered by a layer of black stretch shrink wrap film (black foil) and aluminum foil and incubated at 21°C/19°C day/night temperatures, with a 16 h photoperiod (photosynthetic photon fluence rate of 20 μmol m-2 s-1 over the waveband 400-700 nm) for 7 d in an AR-36L growth chamber","In nature, root systems of most terrestrial plants are protected from light exposure by growing in a dark soil environment. Hence, in vitro cultivation in transparent Petri dishes leads to physiological perturbations, but the mechanisms underlying root-mediated light perception and responses have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we compared Arabidopsis thaliana seedling development in transparent and darkened Petri dishes at low light intensity (20 µmol m(-2) s(-1)), allowing us to follow (inter alia) hypocotyl elongation, which is an excellent process for studying interactions of signals involved in the regulation of growth and developmental responses. To obtain insights into molecular events underlying differences in seedling growth under these two conditions, we employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) shotgun proteomics (available via the PRIDE deposit PXD001612). In total, we quantified the relative abundances of peptides representing 1,209 proteins detected in all sample replicates of LC-MS analyses. Comparison of MS spectra after manual validation revealed 48 differentially expressed proteins. Functional classification, analysis of available gene expression data and literature searches revealed alterations associated with root illumination (inter alia) in autotrophic CO2 fixation, C compound and carbohydrate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. The results also indicate a previously unreported role for cytokinin plant hormones in the escape-tropism response to root illumination. We complemented these results with reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), chlorophyll fluorescence and detailed cytokinin signaling analyses, detecting in the latter a significant increase in the activity of the cytokinin two-component signaling cascade in roots and implicating the cytokinin receptor AHK3 as the major mediator of root to hypocotyl signaling in responses to root illumination.","['Actins/metabolism', 'Arabidopsis/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytokinins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/radiation effects', 'Hypocotyl/*anatomy & histology/radiation effects', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Photosynthesis/radiation effects', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Plant Roots/*anatomy & histology/radiation effects', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', '*Signal Transduction/radiation effects']","['Proteins', 'Active site prediction', 'Protein interactions', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mapping', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Light microscopy', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'protein', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Here we employed mild in vivo crosslinking, isobaric labeling, and tandem mass spectrometry to characterize molecular interactions of human tau in a neuroblastoma cell model. The study revealed a robust association of tau with the ribonucleoproteome, including major protein complexes involved in RNA processing and translation, and documented binding of tau to several heat shock proteins, the proteasome and microtubule-associated proteins. Follow-up experiments determined the relative contribution of cellular RNA to the tau interactome and mapped interactions to N- or C-terminal tau domains. We further document that expression of P301L mutant tau disrupts interactions of the C-terminal half of tau with heat shock proteins and the proteasome. The data are consistent with a model whereby a higher propensity of P301L mutant tau to aggregate may reflect a perturbation of its chaperone-assisted stabilization and proteasome-dependent degradation. Finally, using a global proteomics approach, we show that heterologous expression of a tau construct that lacks the C-terminal domain, including the microtubule binding domain, does not cause a discernible shift of the proteome except for a significant direct correlation of steady-state levels of tau and cystatin B.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cystatin B/genetics/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'tau Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Tumor annotation', 'Free cysteine detection', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Heat map', 'protein', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Molecular charge', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular property', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation track', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Lipoproteins', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein domains']"
26168773,The human spermatozoa proteome was in depth characterized using shotgun iterative GeLC-MS/MS method with peptide exclusion lists.,"The Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) aims at cataloguing the proteins as gene products encoded by the human genome in a chromosome-centric manner. The existence of products of about 82% of the genes has been confirmed at the protein level. However, the number of so-called ""missing proteins"" remains significant. It was recently suggested that the expression of proteins that have been systematically missed might be restricted to particular organs or cell types, for example, the testis. Testicular function, and spermatogenesis in particular, is conditioned by the successive activation or repression of thousands of genes and proteins including numerous germ cell- and testis-specific products. Both the testis and postmeiotic germ cells are thus promising sites at which to search for missing proteins, and ejaculated spermatozoa are a potential source of proteins whose expression is restricted to the germ cell lineage. A trans-chromosome-based data analysis was performed to catalog missing proteins in total protein extracts from isolated human spermatozoa. We have identified and manually validated peptide matches to 89 missing proteins in human spermatozoa. In addition, we carefully validated three proteins that were scored as uncertain in the latest neXtProt release (09.19.2014). A focus was then given to the 12 missing proteins encoded on chromosomes 2 and 14, some of which may putatively play roles in ciliation and flagellum mechanistics. The expression pattern of C2orf57 and TEX37 was confirmed in the adult testis by immunohistochemistry. On the basis of transcript expression during human spermatogenesis, we further consider the potential for discovering additional missing proteins in the testicular postmeiotic germ cell lineage and in ejaculated spermatozoa. This project was conducted as part of the C-HPP initiatives on chromosomes 14 (France) and 2 (Switzerland).

26543102,"Protein phosphorylation, one of the most common and important modifications of acute and reversible regulation of protein function, plays a dominant role in almost all cellular processes. These signaling events regulate cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, survival and apoptosis. Several studies have been successfully used to identify phosphorylated proteins and dynamic changes in phosphorylation status after stimulation. Nevertheless, it is still rather difficult to elucidate precise complex phosphorylation signaling pathways. In particular, how signal transduction pathways directly communicate from the outer cell surface through cytoplasmic space and then directly into chromatin networks to change the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape remains poorly understood. Here we describe the optimization and comparison of methods based on thiophosphorylation affinity enrichment, which can be utilized to monitor phosphorylation signaling into chromatin by isolation of phosphoprotein containing nucleosomes, a method we term phosphorylation-specific chromatin affinity purification (PS-ChAP). We utilized this PS-ChAP approach in combination with quantitative proteomics to identify changes in the phosphorylation status of chromatin bound proteins on nucleosomes following perturbation of transcriptional processes. We also demonstrate that this method can be employed to map phosphoprotein signaling into chromatin containing nucleosomes through identifying the genes those phosphorylated proteins are found on via thiophosphate PS-ChAP-qPCR. Thus, our results showed that PS-ChAP offers a new strategy for studying cellular signaling and chromatin biology, allowing us to directly and comprehensively investigate phosphorylation signaling into chromatin to investigate if these pathways are involved in altering gene expression.","Protein phosphorylation, one of the most common and important modifications of acute and reversible regulation of protein function, plays a dominant role in almost all cellular processes.

Reduced NCOR2 expression significantly associates with shorter disease-free survival in patients with PC receiving adjuvant ADT. Utilizing the CWR22 xenograft model, we demonstrate that stably reduced NCOR2 expression accelerates disease recurrence following ADT, associates with gene expression patterns that include neuroendocrine features, and induces DNA hypermethylation. Stably reduced NCOR2 expression in isogenic LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and LNCaP-C4-2 (androgen-independent) cells revealed that NCOR2 reduction phenocopies the impact of androgen treatment and induces global DNA hypermethylation patterns. NCOR2 genomic binding is greatest in LNCaP-C4-2 cells and most clearly associates with forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXA1 binding. NCOR2 binding significantly associates with transcriptional regulation most when in active enhancer regions.

Metformin, as a classic hypoglycaemic drug, has been proved to reduce body weight in type 2 diabetes, the specific mechanism has not been completely clear. A few studies have explored its effect on adipogenesis in vitro, but the existing experimental results are ambiguous. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used to explore the effects of metformin on the morphological and physiological changes of lipid droplets during adipogenesis. A high throughput sequencing was used to examine the effects of metformin on the transcriptome of adipogenesis. Considering the inevitable errors among independent experiments, we performed integrated bioinformatics analysis to identify important genes involved in adipogenesis and reveal potential molecular mechanisms. During the process of adipogenesis, metformin visibly relieved the morphological and functional changes. In addition, metformin reverses the expression pattern of genes related to adipogenesis at the transcriptome level.

34931241,Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in HCT116 colorectal cancer cell (HiChIP),"CTCF is crucial to the organization of mammalian genomes into loop structures. According to recent studies, the transcription apparatus is compartmentalized and concentrated at super-enhancers to form phase-separated condensates and drive the expression of cell-identity genes. However, it remains unclear whether and how transcriptional condensates are coupled to higher-order chromatin organization. Here, we show that CTCF is essential for RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated chromatin interactions, which occur as hyperconnected spatial clusters at super-enhancers. We also demonstrate that CTCF clustering, unlike Pol II clustering, is independent of liquid-liquid phase-separation and resistant to perturbation of transcription. Interestingly, clusters of Pol II, BRD4, and MED1 were found to dissolve upon CTCF depletion, but were reinstated upon restoration of CTCF, suggesting a potent instructive function for CTCF in the formation of transcriptional condensates. Overall, we provide evidence suggesting that CTCF-mediated chromatin looping acts as an architectural prerequisite for the assembly of phase-separated transcriptional condensates.","['CCCTC-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mediator Complex Subunit 1/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Complementary medicine', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor accession']"
35228570,LKB1 drives stasis and C/EBP-mediated reprogramming to an alveolar type II fate in lung cancer,"LKB1 is among the most frequently altered tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma. Inactivation of Lkb1 accelerates the growth and progression of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumors in mouse models. However, the molecular mechanisms by which LKB1 constrains lung tumorigenesis and whether the cancer state that stems from Lkb1 deficiency can be reverted remains unknown. To identify the processes governed by LKB1 in vivo, we generated an allele which enables Lkb1 inactivation at tumor initiation and subsequent Lkb1 restoration in established tumors. Restoration of Lkb1 in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumors suppressed proliferation and led to tumor stasis. Lkb1 restoration activated targets of C/EBP transcription factors and drove neoplastic cells from a progenitor-like state to a less proliferative alveolar type II cell-like state. We show that C/EBP transcription factors govern a subset of genes that are induced by LKB1 and depend upon NKX2-1. We also demonstrate that a defining factor of the alveolar type II lineage, C/EBPα, constrains oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumor growth in vivo. Thus, this key tumor suppressor regulates lineage-specific transcription factors, thereby constraining lung tumor development through enforced differentiation.","['*AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']","['protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"

In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients.

The nematodes were exposed to K. pneumoniae for different time-points (12, 24 and 36 h) and the changes in the regulation were analyzed by employing mass spectrometry.","The enterobacterium, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> invades the intestinal epithelium of humans by interfering with multiple host cell response. To uncover a system-level overview of host response during infection, we analyzed the global dynamics of protein profiling in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> using quantitative proteomics approach. Comparison of protein samples of nematodes exposed to <i>K. pneumoniae</i> for 12, 24, and 36 h by 2DE revealed several changes in host proteome. A total of 266 host-encoded proteins were identified by 2DE MALDI-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS and the interacting partners of the identified proteins were predicted by STRING 10.0 analysis. In order to understand the interacting partners of regulatory proteins with similar or close pI ranges, a liquid IEF was performed and the isolated fractions containing proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Functional bioinformatics analysis on identified proteins deciphered that they were mostly related to the metabolism, dauer formation, apoptosis, endocytosis, signal transduction, translation, developmental, and reproduction process. Gene enrichment analysis suggested that the metabolic process as the most overrepresented pathway regulated against <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infection. The dauer-like formation in infected <i>C. elegans</i> along with intestinal atrophy and ROS during the physiological analysis indicated that the regulation of metabolic pathway is probably through the involvement of mTOR. Immunoblot analysis supported the above notion that the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infection induced protein mis-folding in host by involving PI3Kinase/AKT-1/mTOR mediated pathway. Furthermore, the susceptibility of <i>pdi-2, akt-1</i>, and <i>mTOR C. elegans</i> mutants confirmed the role and involvement of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in mediating protein mis-folding which appear to be translating the vulnerability of host defense toward <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infection.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'Intestines/microbiology/pathology', 'Klebsiella Infections/veterinary', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae/*pathogenicity', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics/physiology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteome/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Proteostasis Deficiencies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Author ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'Infectious disease', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'IDAT', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Kinase name', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Epistasis', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
30008298,"To form operative neuronal networks neurons connect to their synaptic partners by axonal outgrowth guided by the movement of the axon tip, a specialized structure known as the growth cone (GC), which travels along stereotypical paths by sensing extracellular guidance cues. Interestingly, GCs contain complex transcriptomes and different guidance cues can rapidly regulate the translation of specific mRNAs which help to remodel the GC cytoskeleton thus steering axon navigation. However, the full landscape of proteomic changes elicited by different cues is not known and the precise protein synthesis (PS)-dependent molecular mechanisms underlying GC repulsive and attractive turning remain largely elusive. Here we have investigated the cue-induced changes in the nascent proteome by pulse Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (pSILAC) in somaless developing retinal axons derived from Xenopus laevis primary cultures. The experimental approach presented major challenges due to the limited quantity of axonal material (~2 μg per condition) and to the desired rapid (5-15 min) time-scale (no previous work has accomplished SILAC with a pulse less than 20 min). To overcome these difficulties we used a superior protocol, termed Single-Pot Solid- Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation, based on ultrasensitive paramagnetic bead technology which allows high proteomic sample recovery from sub-microgram amounts of material. By employing this method we were able to identify up to 500 newly synthesized proteins after only 5 min of pSILAC. Subsequently, we successfully validated the purity and viability of the axonal samples and the reliability of the method. Finally, to characterize and quantify the global patterns of the axonal translational changes in response to specific guidance cues and to unravel the switch between repulsive and attractive responses, we carried out pSILAC in the presence of different repulsive cues and pharmacological reagents that convert repulsion into attraction. Our results uncovered a surprisingly high level of translational activity within the axonal compartment, even in basal conditions. Remarkably, comparative analysis revealed many changes in the nascent proteome in response to different cues, some distinct and some common. Interestingly, several proteins showed cue-specific downregulation. Taken together, our findings suggest a comprehensive GC PS-dependent chemotropic model and novel cue-specific molecular mechanisms possibly underlying the integration of chemotropic responses.","Axonal protein synthesis and degradation are rapidly regulated by extrinsic signals during neural wiring, but the full landscape of proteomic changes remains unknown due to limitations in axon sampling and sensitivity. By combining pulsed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture with single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation, we characterized the nascent proteome of isolated retinal axons on an unparalleled rapid timescale (5 min). Our analysis detects 350 basally translated axonal proteins on average, including several linked to neurological disease. Axons stimulated by different cues (Netrin-1, BDNF, Sema3A) show distinct signatures with more than 100 different nascent protein species up- or downregulated within the first 5 min followed by further dynamic remodeling. Switching repulsion to attraction triggers opposite regulation of a subset of common nascent proteins. Our findings thus reveal the rapid remodeling of the axonal proteomic landscape by extrinsic cues and uncover a logic underlying attraction versus repulsion.","['Animals', 'Axons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Netrin-1/*pharmacology', 'Neuronal Outgrowth/drug effects', 'Proteome/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Semaphorin-3A/*pharmacology', 'Xenopus laevis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'Introns', 'Isotropic B factor', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Stable isotope dimethyl labelling', 'Isotope-coded protein label', '18O labeling', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'NET', 'STRING ID', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'EMAP', ""Ensembl ID ('Xenopus tropicalis')""]"

We sought to examine this question further by delineating NCK1- and NCK2-specific signalling networks. We used both affinity purification-mass spectrometry and BioID proximity labelling to identify NCK1/2 signalling networks comprised of 98 proteins. Strikingly, we found 30 proteins restricted to NCK1 and 28 proteins specifically associated with NCK2, thus suggesting differences in their function. We report that Nck2-/-, but not Nck1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are multi-nucleated and display extended protrusions reminiscent of intercellular bridges, which correlate with an extended time spent in cytokinesis as well as a failure of a significant proportion of cells to complete abscission. Our data also show that the midbody of NCK2-deficient cells is not only increased in length, but also altered in composition, as judged by the mislocalization of AURKB, PLK1 and ECT2. Finally, we show that NCK2 function during cytokinesis requires its SH2 domain. Taken together, our data delineate the first high-confidence interactome for NCK1/2 adaptors and highlight a number of proteins specifically associated with either protein. We further demonstrate that contrary to what is generally accepted, NCK1 and NCK2 are not completely redundant, and shed light on a previously uncharacterized function for the NCK2 adaptor protein in cell division.","Signals from cell surface receptors are often relayed via adaptor proteins.

Although this protein play important roles in the ufmylation, its other biological functions have not been explored.

A recent study has indicated that the UFM1-binding and PCI domain-containing protein 1 (UFBP1) is required for the conjugation of UFM1 to a substrate. However, other biological functions of UFBP1 have not been explored. Here, we use immunoprecipitation and label-free quantitative proteomics to identify UFBP1-interacting proteins in a mammalian cell line. About 80 potential interacting proteins are obtained from MS analyses of three biological replicates. Bioinformatics analyses of these proteins suggest that UFBP1 may participate in the regulation of protein folding, stability, and trafficking. Biochemical experiments discover that UFBP1 expression downregulates the protein level and reduces the stability of several of its interacting proteins, while UFBP1 knockdown increases their protein levels. Protein synthesis inhibition and proteasomal inhibition experiments reveal that UFBP1 promotes their ubiquitination and degradation. Experiments using a model UFBP1-interacting protein ANT3 demonstrate that UFBP1 enhances the interaction between ANT3 and its E3 ligase and thus promotes its ubiquitination and degradation.

30971704,Seminal fluid sample were collected from dominant and subdominant males who were re peatedly mated to first female followed by a mating to the novel second female. The goal in to monitor seminal fluid investment and composition changed dynamically over the successive matings. Our results indicate that ejaculate expenditure over a mating sequence is associated with dynamic SFP changes driven by a combination of depletion and strategic allocation.,"Theory predicts that males will strategically invest in ejaculates according to the value of mating opportunities. While strategic sperm allocation has been studied extensively, little is known about concomitant changes in seminal fluid (SF) and its molecular composition, despite increasing evidence that SF proteins (SFPs) are fundamental in fertility and sperm competition. Here, we show that in male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, along with changes in sperm numbers and SF investment, SF composition changed dynamically over successive matings with a first female, immediately followed by mating with a second, sexually novel female. The SF proteome exhibited a pattern of both protein depletion and enrichment over successive matings, including progressive increases in immunity and plasma proteins. Ejaculates allocated to the second female had distinct proteomic profiles, where depletion of many SFPs was compensated by increased investment in others. This response was partly modulated by male social status: when mating with the second, novel female, subdominants (but not dominants) preferentially invested in SFPs associated with sperm composition, which may reflect status-specific differences in mating rates, sperm maturation and sperm competition. Global proteomic SF analysis thus reveals that successive matings trigger rapid, dynamic SFP changes driven by a combination of depletion and strategic allocation.","['Animals', 'Chickens/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Male', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteome/analysis/*metabolism', 'Semen/*metabolism', 'Seminal Plasma Proteins/metabolism', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mapping', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'MAT', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Essential dynamics', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'GEN', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Dermatology', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum']"

30622252,"Mutations in the ATM tumor suppressor gene confer cellular hypersensitivity to various DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. To explore genetic resistance mechanisms towards such drugs, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in cells treated with the DNA topoisomerase I poison topotecan. Our ensuing characterizations of hits established that loss of terminal components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) machinery or components of the BRCA1-A complex specifically confer topotecan resistance to ATM-deficient cells. Our findings indicate that hypersensitivity of ATM-mutant cells to topotecan or the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib is due to delayed engagement of homologous recombination repair (HRR) at a subset of DNA-replication-fork associated single ended double-strand breaks (seDSBs), which allows non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mediated repair, resulting in toxic chromosome fusions. Thus, restoration of legitimate repair in ATM-deficient cells – either by preventing the DNA ligation step of NHEJ or by enhancing HRR engagement by deregulating the BRCA1-A complex – markedly suppresses this toxicity. We conclude that the crucial role for ATM at seDSBs is to prevent toxic LIG4-mediated NHEJ at damaged replication forks. Furthermore, our observation that suppressor mutations in ATM-mutant backgrounds are fundamentally different to those that operate in BRCA1-mutant scenarios suggests new opportunities for patient stratification in the clinic, as well as additional therapeutic vulnerabilities that might be exploited in drug-resistant cancers.","Mutations in the ATM tumor suppressor gene confer hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.

Preventing DSB ligation by NHEJ, or enhancing homologous recombination by BRCA1-A complex disruption, suppresses this toxicity, highlighting a crucial role for ATM in preventing toxic LIG4-mediated chromosome fusions. Notably, suppressor mutations in ATM-mutant backgrounds are different to those in BRCA1-mutant scenarios, suggesting new opportunities for patient stratification and additional therapeutic vulnerabilities for clinical exploitation.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'BRCA1 Protein/metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/*genetics', 'DNA Ligase ATP/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phthalazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Topotecan/pharmacology/therapeutic use']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'DNA testing', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'System metadata', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'pair', 'DNA base pair stacking energies data', 'Data mining', 'DNA', 'dna', 'DNA base structural data', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'SAGE experimental data', 'Ophthalmology', 'Workflows', 'Protein topology', 'Topology format', 'Topology data']"
30926424,"Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation induced by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1) plays a pivotal role in the fibrogenesis. The complex downstream mediators of TGF-β1 are largely unknown. Here, proteomics analysis and biological validation demonstrated that methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) was significantly upregulated in a CCl4-induced fibrosis mice model and a small molecule NPLC0393, known to block TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling, inhibited its upregulation. In HSC cells, TGF-β1 induced elevation of MAT2A and MAT2β expression as well as reduction of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) content, which further promoted HSC activation. Functionally, in vivo and in vitro knockdown of MAT2A alleviated CCl4- and TGF-β1-induced HSC activation, whereas in vivo overexpression of MAT2A facilitated hepatic fibrosis and abolished therapeutic effect of NPLC0393. TGF-β1 induced p65 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, thereby promoted the transcription of MAT2A and its protein expression. In addition, overexpression of p65 abrogated NPLC0393 mediated inhibition of HSC activation. This study identified a novel pathway TGF-β1/p65/MAT2A that was involved in the regulation of intracellular SAM contents and liver fibrogenesis, suggesting that this pathway is a potential therapeutic target for hepatic fibrosis.","Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a pivotal role in fibrogenesis, while the complex downstream mediators of TGF-β1 in such process are largely unknown.","['Biomarkers', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics/methods', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor binding sites']"

LFQ analysis highlighted that 3-HKA downregulated many of the inflammatory pathways, more notably JAK/STAT1 and NFkB, associated with IFNgamma activation.","Tryptophan catabolism is a major metabolic pathway utilized by several professional and non-professional antigen presenting cells to maintain immunological tolerance. Here we report that 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenamine (3-HKA) is a biogenic amine produced via an alternative pathway of tryptophan metabolism. In vitro, 3-HKA has an anti-inflammatory profile by inhibiting the IFN-γ mediated STAT1/NF-κΒ pathway in both mouse and human dendritic cells (DCs) with a consequent decrease in the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably TNF, IL-6, and IL12p70. 3-HKA has protective effects in an experimental mouse model of psoriasis by decreasing skin thickness, erythema, scaling and fissuring, reducing TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-17 production, and inhibiting generation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similarly, in a mouse model of nephrotoxic nephritis, besides reducing inflammatory cytokines, 3-HKA improves proteinuria and serum urea nitrogen, overall ameliorating immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and renal dysfunction.

Hence, characterizing intact N-glycopeptides of IgGs that correspond to N-glycan structure with specific site information enable better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and finding out some novel signatures in preoperative discrimination of BPH from PCa.

The quantitative analysis of the N-linked intact glycopeptides using pGlyco 2.0 and MaxQuant software provided quantitative information on plasma IgG subclass-specific and site-specific N-glycosylation. As a result, we found four aberrantly expressed N-linked intact glycopeptides across different IgG subclasses.

Additionally, the variations in these N-linked intact glycopeptide abundances were not caused by the changes in the IgG concentrations. Furthermore, IgG2-GP09 displayed a more powerful prediction capability (auROC = 0.702) for distinguishing PCa from BPH than the clinical index t-PSA (auROC = 0.681) when used alone or in combination with other indicators (auROC = 0.853).

To match the structurally unassigned helices to sequence from the large disordered regions of DNA-PKcs (a.a 2577-2773), we used integrative modelling. Two sequence assignments were possible. The cluster of models with the helix assignment towards the N-terminal side was favored by reduced kinetics of exchange as measured by HX-MS.","Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS) has made important contributions to the study of protein structure and function.

32964716,"In somatic embryogenesis, embryos are formed from a single or small group of somatic cells in response to stress and hormonal stimuli. In this study, a high-throughput phosphoproteomic analysis was used to identify and quantify phosphoproteins related to the acquisition of embryogenic competence in sugarcane. Embryogenic (EC) and nonembryogenic (NEC) calli were compared at the multiplication phase, resulting in the identification of 1279 phosphoproteins. After the differential accumulation analysis, 163 phosphoproteins were identified as unique to EC, and nine were unique to NEC, while 51 were upaccumulated, and 40 were downaccumulated in EC compared to NEC. These phosphopeptides were mainly single phosphorylated peptides, with serine residues representing the major site of phosphorylation. The motif-x analysis revealed the enrichment of [xxxpSPxxx], [RxxpSxxx] and [xxxpSDxxx] motifs, which are predicted phosphorylation sites for several kinases related to stress responses. Gene ontology enrichment revealed an overrepresentation of biological processes involved in embryonic development, showing that EC-related phosphoproteins (unique to EC and upaccumulated) were associated with stress responses, regulation of gene expression and epigenetic modifications. The NEC-related phosphoproteins (unique to NEC and downaccumulated) were associated with the translation process. In this sense, EC-related phosphoproteins described as potential regulators of abiotic stress tolerance in response to ABA-induced signals such as OSK3 (a catalytic subunit of SnRK1), ABF1, LEAs, REM4.1 and RD29Bs were identified.

34785650,mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of VAMP8 prevents a starvation-induced VAMP8-SCFD1 interaction that promotes SNARE activity and autolysosome fusion,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) has been shown to regulate autophagy at different steps. However, how mTORC1 regulates the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein receptor (SNARE) complex remains elusive. Here we show that mTORC1 inhibits formation of the SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by phosphorylating VAMP8, thereby blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion. A VAMP8 phosphorylation mimic mutant is unable to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro. Furthermore, we identify SCFD1, a Sec1/Munc18-like protein, that localizes to the autolysosome and is required for SNARE complex formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion. VAMP8 promotes SCFD1 recruitment to autolysosomes when dephosphorylated. Consistently, phosphorylated VAMP8 or SCFD1 depletion inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and expression of phosphomimic VAMP8 leads to increased lipid droplet accumulation when expressed in mouse liver. Thus, our study supports that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of VAMP8 blocks SCFD1 recruitment, thereby inhibiting STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complex formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion.","['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Autophagosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes', 'Male', 'Membrane Fusion/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Qa-SNARE Proteins/metabolism', 'Qb-SNARE Proteins/metabolism', 'Qc-SNARE Proteins/metabolism', 'R-SNARE Proteins/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']","['Protein report', 'Proteins', 'Transposon prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Kinase name']"
34305947,"In recent years the clinical success of T cell-based immunotherapy approaches has revolutionized treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, still some patients do not respond to available therapies at all, others for limited time only. A promising low side-effect approach is peptide-based immunotherapy, which relies on specific immune recognition of tumor-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. In this study, we developed a workflow for the immunopeptidome-guided design of off-the shelf warehouses for personalized peptide vaccines using the example of chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). The so defined warehouses could provide the basis for different T cell-based immunotherapy approaches such as TCR-engineered T cell transfer or multi-peptide vaccinations. The warehouse approach enables a fast and cost-effective way to provide a personalized T cell-based immunotherapeutic approach. The here defined peptide warehouse is already utilized for a personalized multi-peptide vaccine trial (iVAC-XS15-CLL01, NCT04688385).","Antigen-specific immunotherapies, in particular peptide vaccines, depend on the recognition of naturally presented antigens derived from mutated and unmutated gene products on human leukocyte antigens, and represent a promising low-side-effect concept for cancer treatment. So far, the broad application of peptide vaccines in cancer patients is hampered by challenges of time- and cost-intensive personalized vaccine design, and the lack of neoepitopes from tumor-specific mutations, especially in low-mutational burden malignancies. In this study, we developed an immunopeptidome-guided workflow for the design of tumor-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouses for broadly applicable personalized therapeutics.

34831084,Immunoprecipitation of AKAP to identify interactors.,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of maladaptive cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In the damaged heart, loss of function is mainly due to cardiomyocyte death and remodeling of the cardiac tissue. The current study shows that A-kinase anchoring protein 2 (AKAP2) orchestrates cellular processes favoring cardioprotection in infarcted hearts. Induction of AKAP2 knockout (KO) in cardiomyocytes of adult mice increases infarct size and exacerbates cardiac dysfunction after MI, as visualized by increased left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction. In cardiomyocytes, AKAP2 forms a signaling complex with PKA and the steroid receptor co-activator 3 (Src3). Upon activation of cAMP signaling, the AKAP2/PKA/Src3 complex favors PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα). This results in the upregulation of ER-dependent genes involved in protection against apoptosis and angiogenesis, including Bcl2 and the vascular endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa). In line with these findings, cardiomyocyte-specific AKAP2 KO reduces Bcl2 and VEGFa expression, increases myocardial apoptosis and impairs the formation of new blood vessels in infarcted hearts. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKAP2 organizes a transcriptional complex that mediates pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic responses that protect infarcted hearts.","['A Kinase Anchor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Electrocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Deletion', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardial Infarction/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']","['Proteins', 'Kinase name', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Electrocardiography', 'Electroencephalography', 'Mapping', 'Prosite accession number', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene ID', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Clinical trial report', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'GEN', 'Protein complex', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression']"

We analyzed the proteome of myelin biochemically purified from mouse brains upon genetic disruption of the Cmtm5-gene specifically in myelinating cells. An ion mobility-enhanced version of data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflow with alternating low and elevated energy (referred to as UDMSE) was used to compare protein abundance in Cmtm5 cKO and CTRL samples by label-free quantification. Specifically, dynamic range enhancement (DRE)-UDMSE was applied as a dedicated data acquisition mode recently introduced for routine differential myelin proteome profiling. We found that Cmtm5 cKO mice displayed a largely similar myelin proteome composition as control mice and, together with other data such as electron micrographs, concluded that CMTM5 is not essential for myelin biogenesis and composition. However, oligodendroglial Cmtm5-deficiency causes an early-onset progressive axonopathy, presumably following a Wallerian-like pathomechanism. These results indicate that CMTM5 is involved in the function of oligodendrocytes to maintain axonal integrity rather than myelin biogenesis.","Oligodendrocytes facilitate rapid impulse propagation along the axons they myelinate and support their long-term integrity.

IOP, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), and the retinal flash response was monitored longitudinally. Post-mortem examinations included immunohistochemistry, microarray, and mass spectrometric analysis. RNFLT was significantly increased in the HMGB1 group compared to the IgG group (p<0.001). RGC density showed improved neuronal cell survival in the retina in HMGB1 compared to the IgG group (p<0.01). Mass spectrometric proteomic analysis of retinal tissue showed increased abundance of RNA metabolism-associated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), such as hnRNP U, D, and H2, in animals injected with the anti-HMGB1 Ab, indicating that application of the antibody may cause increased gene expression.

Epidemiological studies often use exposure surrogates that may not fully account for the impacts of spatially and temporally changing concentrations on population exposure.We examined the impact of large NOx decreases on spatial and temporal O3 patterns and the implications on exposure.We used a photochemical model to estimate O3 response to large NOx reductions. We derived time series of 2006-2008 O3 concentrations consistent with 50% and 75% NOx emissions reduction scenarios in three urban areas (Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago) at each monitor location and spatially interpolated O3 to census-tract centroids.We predicted that low O3 concentrations would increase and high O3 concentrations would decrease in response to NOx reductions within an urban area. O3 increases occurred across larger areas for the seasonal mean metric than for the regulatory metric (annual 4th highest daily 8-hr maximum) and were located only in urban core areas. O3 always decreased outside the urban core (e.g., at locations of maximum local ozone concentration) for both metrics and decreased within the urban core in some instances. NOx reductions led to more uniform spatial gradients and diurnal and seasonal patterns and caused seasonal peaks in midrange O3 concentrations to shift from midsummer to earlier in the year.These changes have implications for how O3 exposure may change in response to NOx reductions and are informative for the design of future epidemiology studies and risk assessments.Simon H, Wells B, Baker KR, Hubbell B. 2016.

27249102,"Human age estimation is an important and difficult challenge. Different biomarkers and numerous approaches have been studied for biological age estimation, each with its advantages and limitations. In this work, we investigate whether physical activity can be exploited for biological age estimation for adult humans. We introduce an approach based on deep convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) to predict biological age, using human physical activity as recorded by a wearable device. We also demonstrate five deep biological age estimation models including the proposed approach and compare their performance on the NHANES physical activity dataset. Results on mortality hazard analysis using both the Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that the proposed method for estimating biological age outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. This work has significant implications in combining wearable sensors and deep learning techniques for improved health monitoring, for instance, in a mobile health environment. Mobile health (mHealth) applications provide patients, caregivers, and administrators continuous information about a patient, even outside the hospital.","Aging is reflected by highly reproducible DNA methylation (DNAm) changes that open new perspectives for estimation of chronological age in legal medicine. DNA can be harvested non-invasively from cells at the inside of a person's cheek using buccal swabs - but these specimens resemble heterogeneous mixtures of buccal epithelial cells and leukocytes with different epigenetic makeup. In this study, we have trained an age predictor based on three age-associated CpG sites (associated with the genesPDE4C, ASPA, and ITGA2B) for swab samples to reach a mean absolute deviation (MAD) between predicted and chronological age of 4.3 years in a training set and of 7.03 years in a validation set. Subsequently, the composition of buccal epithelial cells versus leukocytes was estimated by two additional CpGs (associated with the genes CD6 and SERPINB5). Results of this ""Buccal-Cell-Signature"" correlated with cell counts in cytological stains (R2 = 0.94). Combination of cell type-specific and age-associated CpGs into one multivariate model enabled age predictions with MADs of 5.09 years and 5.12 years in two independent validation sets.

METHODS:For all Danish dwellings within a radius of [Formula: see text] heights and for 25% of randomly selected dwellings within a radius of [Formula: see text] heights, we estimated nighttime outdoor and low-frequency (LF) indoor WTN, using information on WT type and simulated hourly wind. During follow-up from 1996 to 2013, 68,696 adults redeemed sleep medication and 82,373 redeemed antidepressants, from eligible populations of 583,968 and 584,891, respectively. We used Poisson regression with adjustment for individual and area-level covariates. RESULTS:Five-year mean outdoor nighttime WTN of [Formula: see text] was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI]: 0.98, 1.33) for sleep medication and HR = 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.35) for antidepressants (compared with exposure to WTN of [Formula: see text]). We found no overall association with indoor nighttime LF WTN. In age-stratified analyses, the association with outdoor nighttime WTN was strongest among persons [Formula: see text] of age, with HRs (95% CIs) for the highest exposure group ([Formula: see text]) of 1.68 (1.27, 2.21) for sleep medication and 1.23 (0.90, 1.69) for antidepressants.

Data from 917 ALS patients and 2,662 controls were analyzed. Annual mean air pollution concentrations were assessed by land use regression (LUR) models developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE). Exposure estimates included nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx), particulate matter (PM) with diameters of <2.5 ?m (PM2.5), <10 ?m (PM10), between 10 ?m and 2.5 ?m (PMcoarse), and PM2.5 absorbance. We performed conditional logistic regression analysis using two different multivariate models (model 1 adjusted for age, gender, education, smoking status, alcohol use, body mass index, and socioeconomic status; model 2 additionally adjusted for urbanization degree).Risk of ALS was significantly increased for individuals in the upper exposure quartile of PM2.5 absorbance [OR=1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27, 2.18], NO2 (OR=1.74; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.30), and NOx concentrations (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.77).

Associations between 14-day average PM2.5 and the presence of any asthma symptoms during the 14 days leading up to and including the interview date were evaluated using binomial regression. We explored variation by air temperature using similar models, stratified into quintiles of the 14-day average maximum temperature.Among adults with active asthma, 57.1% reported asthma symptoms within the past 14 days, and 14-day average PM2.5 ? 7.07 ?g/m3 was associated with an estimated 4-5% higher asthma symptom prevalence. In the range of 4.00-7.06 ?g/m3 of PM2.5, each 1-?g/m3 increase was associated with a 3.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 5.7] increase in symptom prevalence; across categories of temperature from 1.1 to 80.5°F, each 1-?g/m3 increase was associated with increased symptom prevalence (1.1-44.4°F: 7.9%; 44.5-58.6°F: 6.9%; 58.7-70.1°F: 2.9%; 70.2-80.5°F: 7.3%).These results suggest that each unit increase in PM2.5 may be associated with an increase in the prevalence of asthma symptoms, even at levels as low as 4.00-7.06 ?g/m3.

32068468,"BACKGROUND:In spring 2013, groundwater of a vast area of the Veneto Region (northeastern Italy) was found to be contaminated by perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from a PFAS manufacturing plant active since the late 1960s. Residents were exposed to high concentrations of PFAS, particularly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), through drinking water until autumn 2013. A publicly funded health surveillance program is under way to aid in the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disorders possibly associated with PFAS exposure. OBJECTIVES:The objectives of this paper are: a) to describe the organization of the health surveillance program, b) to report serum PFAS concentrations in adolescents and young adults, and c) to identify predictors of serum PFAS concentrations in the studied population. METHODS:The health surveillance program offered to residents of municipalities supplied by contaminated waterworks includes a structured interview, routine blood and urine tests, and measurement of 12 PFAS in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We studied 18,345 participants born between 1978 and 2002, 14-39 years of age at recruitment. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary, and reproductive predictors of serum PFAS concentrations. RESULTS:The PFAS with the highest serum concentrations were PFOA [median 44.4?ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 19.3-84.9], perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) (median 3.9?ng/mL, IQR 1.9-7.4), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (median 3.9?ng/mL, IQR 2.6-5.8). The major predictors of serum levels were gender, municipality, duration of residence in the affected area, and number of deliveries. Overall, the regression models explained 37%, 23%, and 43% of the variance of PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Serum PFOA concentrations were high relative to concentrations in populations with background residential exposures only. Interindividual variation of serum PFAS levels was partially explained by the considered predictors. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5337.","In spring 2013, groundwater of a vast area of the Veneto Region (northeastern Italy) was found to be contaminated by perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from a PFAS manufacturing plant active since the late 1960s.

28731409,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging pathogen transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The ongoing Caribbean outbreak is of concern due to the potential for infected travelers to spread the virus to countries where vectors are present and the population is susceptible. Although there has been no autochthonous transmission of CHIKV in Canada, there is concern that both Ae. albopictus and CHIKV will become established, particularly under projected climate change. We developed risk maps for autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Canada under recent (1981–2010) and projected climate (2011–2040 and 2041–2070).The risk for CHIKV transmission was the combination of the climatic suitability for CHIKV transmission potential and the climatic suitability for the presence of Ae. albopictus; the former was assessed using a stochastic model to calculate R0 and the latter was assessed by deriving a suitability indicator (SIG) that captures a set of climatic conditions known to influence the ecology of Ae. albopictus. R0 and SIG were calculated for each grid cell in Canada south of 60°N, for each time period and for two emission scenarios, and combined to produce overall risk categories that were mapped to identify areas suitable for transmission and the duration of transmissibility.The risk for autochthonous CHIKV transmission under recent climate is very low with all of Canada classified as unsuitable or rather unsuitable for transmission. Small parts of southern coastal British Columbia become progressively suitable with short-term and long-term projected climate; the duration of potential transmission is limited to 1–2 months of the year.Although the current risk for autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Canada is very low, our study could be further supported by the routine surveillance of Ae. albopictus in areas identified as potentially suitable for transmission given our uncertainty on the current distribution of this species in Canada. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP669","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging pathogen transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes.

26713774,"Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) may increase risk for obesity, but few studies have investigated the joint effects of exposure to SHS and diet.We examined the interaction of exposure to SHS and diet on the prevalence of obesity among 6- to 19-year-olds who participated in the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.We characterized exposure using a novel biomarker [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL)], an established biomarker (cotinine), and self-report. Multinomial logistic regression models examined the association of SHS exposure on the prevalence of overweight and obesity as separate outcomes (compared with normal/underweight). Interaction by diet was assessed by introducing interaction terms (with SHS) of the individual nutrients [dietary fiber, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin C, and vitamin E] into separate models.Approximately half of the children had NNAL and cotinine levels above the limit of detection, indicating exposure to SHS. Interaction results suggest that the prevalence of obesity among children with both high exposure to SHS and low levels of certain nutrients (dietary fiber, DHA, or EPA) is greater than would be expected due to the effects of the individual exposures alone. Little or no evidence suggesting more or less than additive or multiplicative interaction was observed for vitamin C or vitamin E. The association between SHS and obesity did not appear to be modified by dietary vitamin C or vitamin E.Childhood obesity prevention strategies aimed at reducing SHS exposures and improving diets may exceed the expected benefits based on targeting either risk factor alone.Moore BF, Clark ML, Bachand A, Reynolds SJ, Nelson TL, Peel JL. 2016.

27025652,"Tau protein abnormally aggregates in tauopathies, a diverse group of neurologic diseases that includes Alzheimer's disease (AD). In early stages of disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalized, which can contribute to its aggregation and toxicity. We demonstrate that tau phosphorylation at Ser208 (pSer208) promotes microtubule dysfunction and tau aggregation in cultured cells. Comparative assessment of the epitopes recognized by antibodies AT8, CP13, and 7F2 demonstrates that CP13 and 7F2 are specific for tau phosphorylation at Ser202 and Thr205, respectively, independently of the phosphorylation state of adjacent phosphorylation sites. Supporting the involvement of pSer208 in tau pathology, a novel monoclonal antibody 3G12 specific for tau phosphorylation at Ser208 revealed strong reactivity of tau inclusions in the brains of PS19 and rTg4510 transgenic mouse models of tauopathy. 3G12 also labelled neurofibrillary tangles in brains of patients with AD but revealed differential staining compared to CP13 and 7F2 for other types of tau pathologies such as in neuropil threads and neuritic plaques in AD, tufted astrocytes in progressive supranuclear palsy and astrocytic plaques in corticobasal degeneration. These results support the hypothesis that tau phosphorylation at Ser208 strongly contributes to unique types of tau aggregation and may be a reliable marker for the presence of mature neurofibrillary tangles.","Despite continuing debate about the amyloid β-protein (or Aβ hypothesis, new lines of evidence from laboratories and clinics worldwide support the concept that an imbalance between production and clearance of Aβ42 and related Aβ peptides is a very early, often initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of γ-secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates Aβ. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to Aβ deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in > 40% of cases, has been found to impair Aβ clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Aβ42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Aβ antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, Aβ dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.","['Alzheimer Disease/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Presenilins/*metabolism', 'Rats']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Mice or rats', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats']"
27880911,"Nuclear extracts were isolated from 293T cells that stably express USP44 fused with N-terminal FLAG and HA affinity tags (FH-USP44), and then analyzed by tandem affinity purification (TAP) followed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) to uncover USP44 associated proteins. TAP of FH-tagged CETN2 (centrin2), the only known USP44 interacting protein, was also performed followed by MudPIT analysis. A FH-vector control was purified and analyzed in parallel. TCA-precipitated proteins were denatured in 8M urea (Sigma-Aldrich), reduced with Tris(2-Carboxylethyl)-Phosphine Hydrochloride (TCEP; Pierce) and alkylated with chloroacetamide (CAM; Sigma-Aldrich), then digested with endoproteinase LysC (Roche) followed by trypsin (Promega). The resulting peptide mixtures were pressure-loaded onto 250 um fused silica microcapillary columns packed first with 3 cm of 5-um Strong Cation Exchange (SCX) material (Luna; Phenomenex), followed by 1 cm of 5-um C18 reverse phase (Aqua; Phenomenex). Loaded 250 um columns were connected using a filtered union (UpChurch) to 100 um fused-silica columns pulled to a 5 um tip using a P 2000 CO2 laser puller (Sutter Instruments) and packed with 9 cm of reverse phase material. The loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1260 series HPLC. Three channels of the HPLC were filled with: 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (channel A); 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (channel B) and 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid (channel C);. Fully automated 12 step chromatography runs were carried out with a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min, split to 250 nL/min at the tip of the column. Peptides were sequentially eluted from the SCX resin to the reverse phase resin by a 10 min-long salt step of increasing concentrations (0, 7, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 80, 100, 90, 85, and 100% C for steps 1 through 12, respectively), followed by the organic gradient to 75% solvent. The application of a 2.5 kV distal voltage electrosprayed the eluting peptides directly into a Velos-Pro-Orbitrap-ETD Hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a custom-made nano-LC electrospray ionization source. Full MS spectra are recorded on the peptides over a 400 to 1,600 m/z range in the LTQ Velos ion trap, followed by 10 FT tandem mass (MS/MS) events in the Orbitrap at 60K resolution, sequentially generated in a data-dependent manner on the first to tenth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum (at 35% collision energy). Dynamic exclusion enabled for 90sec. Mass spectrometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the XCalibur data system (Thermo Scientific). RAW files were extracted into .ms2 file format using RawDistiller v. 1.0 (in-house developed software). The MS/MS spectra were searched using SEQUEST v.27 (rev.9) with a peptide mass tolerance of 7 ppm and of +/- 0.5 amu for fragment ions. No enzyme specificity was imposed during the SEQUEST searches against a protein database containing 30499 non-redundant human proteins (NCBI 2012-08-27 release), as well as 204 proteins consisting of usual contaminants such as human keratins, IgGs and proteolytic enzymes or added affinity-tagged proteins . To estimate false discovery rates (FDR), each protein sequence was randomized (keeping the same amino acid composition and length) and the resulting ""shuffled"" sequences were added to the database used for the SEQUEST searches, for a total search space of 61406 amino acid sequences. To account for alkylation by CAM, 57.02146 Da were statically added to cysteine residues for all searches. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.0 for doubly-, and 3.0 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully-tryptic and at least 7 amino acids long.","Decreased expression of the USP44 deubiquitinase has been associated with global increases in H2Bub1 levels during mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation. However, whether USP44 directly deubiquitinates histone H2B or how its activity is targeted to chromatin is not known. We identified USP44 as an integral subunit of the nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) complex. USP44 within N-CoR deubiquitinates H2B in vitro and in vivo, and ablation of USP44 impairs the repressive activity of the N-CoR complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments confirmed that USP44 recruitment reduces H2Bub1 levels at N-CoR target loci. Furthermore, high expression of USP44 correlates with reduced levels of H2Bub1 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Depletion of either USP44 or TBL1XR1 impairs the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and causes an increase of global H2Bub1 levels. Our findings indicate that USP44 contributes to N-CoR functions in regulating gene expression and is required for efficient invasiveness of triple-negative breast cancer cells.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/chemistry/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transducin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination', 'WD40 Repeats']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'cel', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Protein expression', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Translational medicine', 'Specific protein resources', 'Disease (specific)', 'Sequence position specification', 'Recombination detection', 'Ordination plot', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Repeat sequences']"

An estimated one-third of humans harbor Mtb in a dormant state. These asymptomatic, latent infections impede tuberculosis eradication due to the long-term potential for reactivation. Dormant Mtb has reduced enzymatic activity, but hydrolases that remain active facilitate pathogen survival. We targeted Mtb esterases, a diverse set of enzymes in the serine hydrolase family, and studied their activities using both activity-based probes (ABPs) and fluorogenic esterase substrates. These small-molecule probes revealed functional esterases in active, dormant, and reactivating cultures. Using ABPs, we identified five esterases that remained active in dormant Mtb, including LipM (Rv2284), LipN (Rv2970c), CaeA (Rv2224c), Rv0183, and Rv1683. Three of these, CaeA, Rv0183, and Rv1683, were catalytically active in all three culture conditions. Fluorogenic probes additionally revealed LipH (Rv1399c), Culp1 (Rv1984c), and Rv3036c esterase activity in dormant and active cultures.

27067055,"The aim of the present project was to study in detail the site-specific phosphorylation events occurring both in resting as well as in T lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2 for five minutes. For that purpose we combined SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry analysis with phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2 beads. We performed three biological replicas of the same experiment which resulted in the identification of above 8500 unique phosphosites corresponding to more than 3000 proteins. From the 6145 phosphosites that were consistently quantified in at least 2 out of the 3 replicas performed, we detected that 390 were regulated by IL-2 being the up-regulated phosphosites five times more abundant than the down-regulated ones. Those IL-2-dependent phosphosites corresponded to distinct proteins involved in distinct aspects of gene expression and cell cycle regulation.","Anti-cancer immunotherapies commonly rely on the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to promote the expansion of T lymphocytes. IL-2- dependent proliferation is the culmination of a complex network of phosphorylation-driven signaling events that impact on gene transcription through mechanisms that are not clearly understood. To study the role of IL-2 in the regulation of nuclear protein function we have performed an unbiased mass spectrometry-based study of the nuclear phosphoproteome of resting and IL-2-treated CD4(+) T lymphocytes. We detected 8521distinct phosphosites including many that are not yet reported in curated phosphorylation databases. Although most phosphorylation sites remained unaffected upon IL-2 treatment, 391 sites corresponding to 288 gene products showed robust IL-2-dependent regulation. Importantly, we show that ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key phosphoprotein effector of IL-2-mediated T-cell responses. ACLY becomes phosphorylated on serine 455 in T lymphocytes upon IL-2-driven activation of AKT, and depletion or inactivation of ACLY compromises IL-2-promoted T-cell growth. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ACLY is required for enhancing histone acetylation levels and inducing the expression of cell cycle regulating genes in response to IL-2. Thus, the metabolic enzyme ACLY emerges as a bridge between cytokine signaling and proliferation of T lymphocytes, and may be an attractive candidate target for the development of more efficient anti-cancer immunotherapies.","['ATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyase/*isolation & purification', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Proteomics/*methods']","['Sequence coordinates', 'Protein active sites', 'Sequence position', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

While the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids is seen as a primary hallmark of NPC1 deficiency, our lipidomics analysis revealed the buildup of several species of glycerophospholipids and other storage lipids in selectively late endosomes/lysosomes of NPC1-KO cells. While the plasma membrane proteome remained largely invariable, we observed pronounced alterations in several proteins linked to autophagy and lysosomal catabolism reflecting vesicular transport obstruction and defective lysosomal turnover resulting from NPC1 deficiency. Thus the use of SPIONs provides a major advancement in fingerprinting subcellular compartments, with an increased potential to identify disease-related alterations in their biomolecular compositions.","['Autophagosomes/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Dextrans/chemistry', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/ultrastructure', 'Niemann-Pick C1 Protein', 'Proteome/metabolism', '*Proteomics', 'Sterols/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism/ultrastructure']","['Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Data retrieval', 'Feature extraction', 'Relation extraction', 'Enzymes', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'MRI', 'Article', 'MRI image', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Article ID', 'Article format', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Protein subcellular localisation', 'Codon usage fraction calculation']"
26657352,The goal of the project is to analyze different layers of proteome information including protein abundance and post-translational modifications of PGRC gastric tissue samples. Three pairs of human gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues were extensively characterized by serial enrichments of phosphorylation and N-glycosylation (SEPG) coupled to LC-MS/MS method.,"Multi-dimensional proteomic analyses provide different layers of protein information, including protein abundance and post-translational modifications. Here, we report an integrated analysis of protein expression, phosphorylation, and N-glycosylation by serial enrichments of phosphorylation and N-glycosylation (SEPG) from the same tissue samples. On average, the SEPG identified 142,106 unmodified peptides of 8,625 protein groups, 18,846 phosphopeptides (15,647 phosphosites), and 4,019 N-glycopeptides (2,634 N-glycosites) in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from three gastric cancer patients. The combined analysis of these data showed that the integrated analysis additively improved the coverages of gastric cancer-related protein networks; phosphoproteome and N-glycoproteome captured predominantly low abundant signal proteins, and membranous or secreted proteins, respectively, while global proteome provided abundances for general population of the proteome. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the SEPG can serve as an effective approach for multi-dimensional proteome analyses, and the holistic profiles of protein expression and PTMs enabled improved interpretation of disease-related networks by providing complementary information.","['Adult', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Protein Interaction Mapping/methods', '*Protein Interaction Maps', '*Proteome', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism']","['Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteins', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Protein interaction data', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

25034945,"The aim of this study was the identification of biomarkers for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). CCC is a primary cancer which arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is characterised by high mortality rates due to its late clinical presentation and limited treatment options. Tumorous tissue and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue from eight CCC patients were analysed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and by mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. After data analysis and statistical evaluation of the proteins which were found to be differentially regulated between the two experimental groups (fold change ? 1.5; p-value ? 0.05), 15 candidate proteins were chosen for verification by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 14 patients. This confirmed the significant up-regulation of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1), gelsolin (GSN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and tax1-binding protein 3 (Tax1BP3) in tumorous cholangiocytes when compared to normal hepatocytes, whereas fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT) were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, STIP1 and SFN were able to differentiate between CCC tumour cells and non-tumorous cholangiocytes with a sensitivity of 100% and 86%, respectively and a specificity of 100% in both cases. We therefore conclude that these proteins should be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CCC in an immunohistochemical application. Additional experiments addressing the validation of these novel biomarker candidates are being performed.","The aim of this study was the identification of novel biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and its immunohistochemical differentiation from benign liver and bile duct cells.

This resulted in a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 64%. We therefore conclude that this protein should be considered as a potential diagnostic biomarker for CCC in an immunohistochemical application, possibly in combination with other candidates from this study in the form of a biomarker panel.

26284758,Gene expression analyses of SMAD4 knockdown in pancreatic cell line,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The TGF-β signaling protein SMAD family member 4 is lost in 60% of PDAC, and this has been associated with poorer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which SMAD4 loss promotes PDAC development are not fully understood. We expressed SMAD4 in human PDAC cell lines BxPC3 and CFPAC1 by selection of stable clones containing an inducible SMAD4 tetracycline inducible expression system construct. After 24 hours of SMAD4 expression, TGF-β signaling-dependent G1 arrest was observed in BxPC3 cells with an increase in the G1 phase fraction from 48.9% to 71.5%. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A by small interfering RNA eliminated the antiproliferative effect, indicating that up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/p21 by TGF-β signaling is necessary for the phenotype. SMAD4 expression had no impact on invasion in BxPC3 cells, but reduced migration. Microarray analysis of gene expression at 8, 24, and 48 hours after SMAD4 expression characterized the regulatory impact of SMAD4 expression in a SMAD4-null PDAC cell line and identified novel targets of TGF-β signaling. Among the novel TGF-β targets identified are anthrax toxin receptor 2 (3.58× at 8 h), tubulin, β-3 class III (7.35× at 8 h), cell migration inducing protein, hyaluronan binding (8.07× at 8 h), IL-1 receptor-like 1 (0.403× at 8 h), regulator of G protein signaling 4 (0.293× at 8 h), and THAP domain containing 11 (0.262× at 8 h). The gene expression changes we observed upon restoration of TGF-β signaling provide numerous new targets for future investigations into PDAC biology and progression.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad4 Protein/*deficiency/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Sequence', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Kinase name', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Cell cycle', 'Psiblast checkpoint file', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Selection detection', 'Transcription', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Here we identify glutaminolysis as a critical pathway for leukemia cell growth downstream of NOTCH1 and a key determinant of the response to anti-NOTCH1 therapies in vivo. Mechanistically, inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL induces a metabolic shutdown, with prominent inhibition of glutaminolysis and triggers autophagy as a salvage pathway supporting leukemia cell metabolism. Consequently, inhibition of glutaminolysis and inhibition of autophagy strongly and synergistically enhance the antileukemic effects of anti-NOTCH1 therapy in mice harboring T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pten loss upregulates glycolysis and consequently rescues leukemic cell metabolism, thereby abrogating the antileukemic effects of NOTCH1 inhibition. Overall, these results identify glutaminolysis as a major node in cancer metabolism controlled by NOTCH1 and as therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

26605526,Reversal of MECP2 duplication syndrome using genetic rescue and antisense oligonucleotides,"Copy number variations have been frequently associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. MECP2 duplication syndrome is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males and is characterized by autism, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, anxiety, epilepsy, recurrent respiratory tract infections and early death. The broad range of deficits caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) overexpression poses a daunting challenge to traditional biochemical-pathway-based therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we sought strategies that directly target MeCP2 and are amenable to translation into clinical therapy. The first question that we addressed was whether the neurological dysfunction is reversible after symptoms set in. Reversal of phenotypes in adult symptomatic mice has been demonstrated in some models of monogenic loss-of-function neurological disorders, including loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome, indicating that, at least in some cases, the neuroanatomy may remain sufficiently intact so that correction of the molecular dysfunction underlying these disorders can restore healthy physiology. Given the absence of neurodegeneration in MECP2 duplication syndrome, we propose that restoration of normal MeCP2 levels in MECP2 duplication adult mice would rescue their phenotype. By generating and characterizing a conditional Mecp2-overexpressing mouse model, here we show that correction of MeCP2 levels largely reverses the behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological deficits. We also reduced MeCP2 using an antisense oligonucleotide strategy, which has greater translational potential. Antisense oligonucleotides are small, modified nucleic acids that can selectively hybridize with messenger RNA transcribed from a target gene and silence it, and have been successfully used to correct deficits in different mouse models. We find that antisense oligonucleotide treatment induces a broad phenotypic rescue in adult symptomatic transgenic MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG), and corrected MECP2 levels in lymphoblastoid cells from MECP2 duplication patients in a dose-dependent manner.","['Animals', 'Attachment Sites, Microbiological/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electroencephalography', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', 'Gene Duplication/genetics', '*Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Duplicate/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*genetics', '*Phenotype']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Matrix/scaffold attachment sites', 'Mathematical model', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrocardiography', 'Tomography', 'Gene ID', 'Codon usage table generation', 'Gene map', 'Duplication detection', 'Gene classification', 'Generation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'R markdown', 'Date', 'geneseq', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Multiomics', 'Integrated gene prediction', 'Ion counting', 'Linked data format', 'JSON-LD', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene transcription', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Read mapping', 'Oligonucleotide probe data', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data']"

A critical issue in RNAa research is that it is difficult to distinguish between changes in gene expression caused indirectly by post-transcriptional regulation and direct induction of gene expression by RNAa. Therefore, in this study, we seek to identify a key factor involved in RNAa, using the induction of ZMYND10 by miR-34a as a system to evaluate RNAa. We identify the positive transcription elongation factors CDK9 and DDX21, which form a complex with nuclear AGO and TNRC6A, as important transcriptional activators of RNAa. In addition, we find that inhibition of DDX21 suppresses RNAa by miR-34a and other miRNAs without inhibiting post-transcriptional regulation. Our findings reveal a strong connection between RNAa and release of paused Pol II, facilitating RNAa research by making it possible to separately analyze post-transcriptional regulation and RNAa.","['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/metabolism', '*DEAD-box RNA Helicases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', '*RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Kinase name', 'Protein pKa calculation', 'Helical net', 'Helical wheel', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'PCR experiment', 'rna', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Here we identify mitotic Olig2-expressing cells as tumor-propagating cells in proneural gliomas, elimination of which blocks tumor initiation and progression. Intriguingly, deletion of Olig2 resulted in tumors that grow, albeit at a decelerated rate. Genome occupancy and expression profiling analyses reveal that Olig2 directly activates cell-proliferation machinery to promote tumorigenesis. Olig2 deletion causes a tumor phenotypic shift from an oligodendrocyte precursor-correlated proneural toward an astroglia-associated gene expression pattern, manifest in downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and reciprocal upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Olig2 deletion further sensitizes glioma cells to EGFR inhibitors and extends the lifespan of animals. Thus, Olig2-orchestrated receptor signaling drives mitotic growth and regulates glioma phenotypic plasticity. Targeting Olig2 may circumvent resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs.","['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'Dendrogram visualisation', 'Dendrograph plotting', 'ClustalW dendrogram', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Reverse complement', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis']"

20463036,Recipient cell nuclear factors are required for reprogramming by nuclear transfer,"Nuclear transfer allows the reprogramming of somatic cells to totipotency. The cell cycle state of the donor and recipient cells, as well as their extent of differentiation, have each been cited as important determinants of reprogramming success. Here, we have used donor and recipient cells at various cell cycle and developmental stages to investigate the importance of these parameters. We found that many stages of the cell cycle were compatible with reprogramming as long as a sufficient supply of essential nuclear factors, such as Brg1, were retained in the recipient cell following enucleation. Consistent with this conclusion, the increased efficiency of reprogramming when using donor nuclei from embryonic cells could be explained, at least in part, by reintroduction of embryonic nuclear factors along with the donor nucleus. By contrast, cell cycle synchrony between the donor nucleus and the recipient cell was not required at the time of transfer, as long as synchrony was reached by the first mitosis. Our findings demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of the reprogramming process and support the importance of nuclear transcriptional regulators in mediating reprogramming.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Nuclear Transfer Techniques']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell biology', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Laboratory techniques']"

26227865,ddRADseq phylogeny study of phrynosomatid lizards,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for phylogenetic studies owing in part to their ubiquity throughout the genome and ease of collection. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) methods are becoming increasingly popular for SNP data collection, but an assessment of the best practises for using these data in phylogenetics is lacking. We use computer simulations, and new double digest RADseq (ddRADseq) data for the lizard family Phrynosomatidae, to investigate the accuracy of RAD loci for phylogenetic inference. We compare the two primary ways RAD loci are used during phylogenetic analysis, including the analysis of full sequences (i.e., SNPs together with invariant sites), or the analysis of SNPs on their own after excluding invariant sites. We find that using full sequences rather than just SNPs is preferable from the perspectives of branch length and topological accuracy, but not of computational time. We introduce two new acquisition bias corrections for dealing with alignments composed exclusively of SNPs, a conditional likelihood method and a reconstituted DNA approach. The conditional likelihood method conditions on the presence of variable characters only (the number of invariant sites that are unsampled but known to exist is not considered), while the reconstituted DNA approach requires the user to specify the exact number of unsampled invariant sites prior to the analysis. Under simulation, branch length biases increase with the amount of missing data for both acquisition bias correction methods, but branch length accuracy is much improved in the reconstituted DNA approach compared to the conditional likelihood approach. Phylogenetic analyses of the empirical data using concatenation or a coalescent-based species tree approach provide strong support for many of the accepted relationships among phrynosomatid lizards, suggesting that RAD loci contain useful phylogenetic signal across a range of divergence times despite the presence of missing data. Phylogenetic analysis of RAD loci requires careful attention to model assumptions, especially if downstream analyses depend on branch lengths.","['Animals', 'Classification/*methods', '*Computer Simulation', 'Lizards/classification/genetics', '*Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Classification', 'Gene classification', 'Simulation', 'Simulation analysis', 'Computer science', 'GeneCards gene report format', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide']"
26527277,CTCF binding polarity determines chromatin looping,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an architectural protein involved in the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin. In this study, we assayed the 3D genomic contact profiles of a large number of CTCF binding sites with high-resolution 4C-seq. As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. To directly test this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete core CTCF binding sites in three loci, including the CTCF site in the Sox2 super-enhancer. In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'System metadata', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein expression', 'Protein report']"

A similar reduction in tumor burden was seen with epigenetic therapy in K-ras or EGFR mutant tumors growing orthotopically. Increased expression of proapoptotic genes and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was seen. Hundreds of genes were demethylated highlighted by the reexpression of polycomb-regulated genes coding for transcription factor binding proteins and the p16 gene, a key regulator of the cell cycle. Highly significant gene expression changes were seen in key regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle, DNA damage, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has been shown to correlate with therapy resistance, but the functional link and signalling pathways remain to be elucidated. Here we report that microRNA-30c, a human breast tumour prognostic marker, has a pivotal role in chemoresistance by a direct targeting of the actin-binding protein twinfilin 1, which promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. An interleukin-6 family member, interleukin-11 is identified as a secondary target of twinfilin 1 in the microRNA-30c signalling pathway. Expression of microRNA-30c inversely correlates with interleukin-11 expression in primary breast tumours and low interleukin-11 correlates with relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. Our study demonstrates that microRNA-30c is transcriptionally regulated by GATA3 in breast tumours. Identification of a novel microRNA-mediated pathway that regulates chemoresistance in breast cancer will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Suppression, Genetic/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Cytometry', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Deletion map', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Transition matrix', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein alignment', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein databases', 'Kinase name', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
21142172,Differential Gene Expression in Daphnia magna Suggests Distinct Modes of Action and Bioavailability for ZnO nanoparticles and Zn ions,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are being rapidly developed for use in consumer products, wastewater treatment, and chemotherapy providing several possible routes for ZnO NP exposure to humans and aquatic organisms. Recent studies have shown that ZnO NPs undergo rapid dissolution to Zn(2+), but the relative contribution of Zn(2+) to ZnO NP bioavailability and toxicity is not clear. We show that a fraction of the ZnO NPs in suspension dissolves, and this fraction cannot account for the toxicity of the ZnO NP suspensions to Daphnia magna. Gene expression profiling of D. magna exposed to ZnO NPs or ZnSO(4) at sublethal concentrations revealed distinct modes of toxicity. There was also little overlap in gene expression between ZnO NPs and SiO(x) NPs, suggesting specificity for the ZnO NP expression profile. ZnO NPs effected expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal transport, cellular respiration, and reproduction. A specific pattern of differential expression of three biomarker genes including a multicystatin, ferritin, and C1q containing gene were confirmed for ZnO NP exposure and provide a suite of biomarkers for identifying environmental exposure to ZnO NPs and differentiating between NP and ionic exposure.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cations/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Daphnia/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*toxicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reproduction/drug effects', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Zinc Oxide/metabolism/*toxicity']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Protein modifications', 'Sequence variations', 'Protein chemical modifications', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Article metadata', 'Article', 'Article ID', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence', 'IDAT', 'Reproductive health', 'Protein report', 'Natural product identification', 'Compound name', 'Chemical identifier', 'Chemical data format', 'Zinc finger prediction']"

Cilia function as signaling centers, but a molecular link to inflammation in the kidney has not been established. Here, we show that cilia in renal epithelia activate chemokine signaling to recruit inflammatory cells. We identify a complex of the ciliary kinase LKB1 and several ciliopathy-related proteins including NPHP1 and PKD1. At homeostasis, this ciliary module suppresses expression of the chemokine CCL2 in tubular epithelial cells. Deletion of LKB1 or PKD1 in mouse renal tubules elevates CCL2 expression in a cell-autonomous manner and results in peritubular accumulation of CCR2<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes, promoting a ciliopathy phenotype. Our findings establish an epithelial organelle, the cilium, as a gatekeeper of tissue immune cell numbers. This represents an unexpected disease mechanism for renal ciliopathies and establishes a new model for how epithelial cells regulate immune cells to affect tissue homeostasis.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/*metabolism', 'Cilia/*pathology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Dogs', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases, Cystic/*congenital/pathology', 'Kidney Tubules/cytology/pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish']","['Protein active sites', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein signature', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Phylogenetic tree reconciliation', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Molecules', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Kinase name', 'Protein data', 'Protein threading', 'Fish']"

By sequencing the ends of 5' phosphorylated mRNA degradation intermediates, we obtain a genome-wide drug-free measurement of ribosome dynamics. We identify general translation termination pauses in both normal and stress conditions. In addition, we describe novel codon-specific ribosomal pausing sites in response to oxidative stress that are dependent on the RNase Rny1.

This dermatitis is thought to be attributed to defects in STAT3 signaling in type 17 helper T cell　specification. However, the role of STAT3 signaling in skin epithelial cells remains unclear. We found that STAT3 signaling in keratinocytes is required to maintain skin homeostasis by negatively controlling the expression of hair follicle-specific keratin genes. These expression patterns correlated with the onset of dermatitis, which was observed in specific pathogen-free conditions but not in germ-free conditions, suggesting the involvement of Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses.

Comparative population analysis suggested that genomic regions harboring energy- and reproduction-associated genes are probably under selection in cultivated citrus. We also narrowed the genetic locus responsible for citrus polyembryony, a form of apomixis, to an 80-kb region containing 11 candidate genes. One of these, CitRWP, is expressed at higher levels in ovules of polyembryonic cultivars.

Most patients are characterised by an indolent disease course and an anergic phenotype of their leukaemia cells, which refers to a state of unresponsiveness to B cell receptor stimulation. Up to 10% of CLL patients transform from an indolent subtype to an aggressive form of B cell lymphoma over time (Richter´s syndrome) and show a significantly worse treatment outcome. Here we show that B cell-specific ablation of Nfat2 leads to the loss of the anergic phenotype culminating in a significantly compromised life expectancy and transformation to aggressive disease. We further define a gene expression signature of anergic CLL cells consisting of several NFAT2-dependent genes including Cbl-b, Grail, Egr2 and Lck. In summary, this study identifies NFAT2 as a crucial regulator of the anergic phenotype in CLL.NFAT2 is a transcription factor that has been linked with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), but its functions in CLL manifestation are still unclear.

These species are primarily isolated from foraging (swine) or grazing (e.g., cattle, sheep) animals and cause sporadic and infrequent human illness. Previous typing studies identified three putative novel C. lanienae-related taxa, based on either MLST or atpA sequence data. To further characterize these putative novel taxa and the C. fetus group as a whole, 76 genomes were sequenced, either to completion or to draft level. These genomes represent 26 C. lanienae strains and 50 strains of the three novel taxa. C. fetus, C. hyointestinalis and C. iguaniorum genomes were previously sequenced to completion; therefore, a comparative genomic analysis across the entire C. fetus group was conducted (including average nucleotide identity analysis) that supports the initial identification of these three novel Campylobacter species. Furthermore, C. lanienae and the three putative novel species form a discrete clade within the C. fetus group, which we have termed the C. lanienae clade. This clade is distinguished from other members of the C. fetus group by a reduced genome size and distinct CRISPR/Cas systems. Moreover, there are two signature characteristics of the C. lanienae clade. C. lanienae clade genomes carry four to ten unlinked and similar, but nonidentical, flagellin genes.

26750514,"Fe-reducing enrichment culture from Chocolate Pots hot springs, Yellowstone National Park","Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","['Bacteria/classification/*metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/*metabolism', 'Hot Springs/*microbiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parks, Recreational', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'Wyoming']","['Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound name', 'Compound accession', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Restriction site creation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Training material', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Data mining', 'Sequence trimming']"
27799288,Gene expression changes in yeast cells deleted for Nat4 and cells grown in calorie-restriction,"Changes in histone modifications are an attractive model through which environmental signals, such as diet, could be integrated in the cell for regulating its lifespan. However, evidence linking dietary interventions with specific alterations in histone modifications that subsequently affect lifespan remains elusive. We show here that deletion of histone N-alpha-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and loss of its associated H4 N-terminal acetylation (N-acH4) extend yeast replicative lifespan. Notably, nat4Δ-induced longevity is epistatic to the effects of calorie restriction (CR). Consistent with this, (i) Nat4 expression is downregulated and the levels of N-acH4 within chromatin are reduced upon CR, (ii) constitutive expression of Nat4 and maintenance of N-acH4 levels reduces the extension of lifespan mediated by CR, and (iii) transcriptome analysis indicates that nat4Δ largely mimics the effects of CR, especially in the induction of stress-response genes. We further show that nicotinamidase Pnc1, which is typically upregulated under CR, is required for nat4Δ-mediated longevity. Collectively, these findings establish histone N-acH4 as a regulator of cellular lifespan that links CR to increased stress resistance and longevity.","['Acetylation', '*Caloric Restriction', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Longevity', 'N-Terminal Acetyltransferase D/*deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Nicotinamidase/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Restriction map', 'Restriction sites', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Histogram', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Terminal gap opening penalty', 'Protein modifications', 'Protein interaction data processing', 'Protein post-translational modifications', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of genetic type and muscle (Longissimus dorsi (LD) vs Biceps femoris (BF)) on gene expression and transcriptional regulation at two developmental stages. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU piglets were slaughtered at birth, and seven IB and 10 IBxDU at four months of age (growing period). Carcass traits and LD intramuscular fat (IMF) content were measured. Muscle transcriptome was analyzed on LD samples with RNA-Seq technology. Carcasses were smaller in IB than in IBxDU neonates (p < 0.001), while growing IB pigs showed greater IMF content (p < 0.05). Gene expression was affected (p < 0.01 and Fold change > 1.5) by the developmental stage (5,812 genes), muscle type (135 genes), and genetic type (261 genes at birth and 113 at growth). Newborns transcriptome reflected a highly proliferative developmental stage, while older pigs showed upregulation of catabolic and muscle functioning processes. Regarding the genetic type effect, IBxDU newborns showed enrichment of gene pathways involved in muscle growth, in agreement with the higher prenatal growth observed in these pigs. However, IB growing pigs showed enrichment of pathways involved in protein deposition and cellular growth, supporting the compensatory gain experienced by IB pigs during this period. Moreover, newborn and growing IB pigs showed more active glucose and lipid metabolism than IBxDU pigs. Moreover, LD muscle seems to have more active muscular and cell growth, while BF points towards lipid metabolism and fat deposition. Several regulators controlling transcriptome changes in both genotypes were identified across muscles and ages (SIM1, PVALB, MEFs, TCF7L2 or FOXO1), being strong candidate genes to drive expression and thus, phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Many of the identified regulators were known to be involved in muscle and adipose tissues development, but others not previously associated with pig muscle growth were also identified, as PVALB, KLF1 or IRF2. The present study discloses potential molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences observed between IB and IBxDU pigs and highlights candidate genes implicated in these molecular mechanisms.","['Animals', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Swine/genetics/*growth & development', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'swiss feature', 'UniProtKB format', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

H3K9me3 induced by either exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) is highly specific to the target loci and transgenerationally heritable. Despite these features, the role of H3K9me3 in siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing and inheritance of the silencing state at native target genes is unclear.

21273816,"Upon pathogenic infection, drosophila larval host mounts an immune response. Parasitic wasps inject venom that contain virulence factors during oviposition, which can elicit host immune response, and in some cases, suppress host immune responses altogether. Several microarray experiments have been performed on different classes of parasitic wasps. We wanted to compare how Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected hosts respond compared to other classes of parasitic wasps.
Third instar y w larvae from a 2-day egglay were infected with G. xanthopoda for three and six hours, respectively, by introducing waps in petri-dish containing larvae. Controls were handled side-by-side without introducing wasps. Host larvae were immediately dissected, infection confirmed by presence of wasp egg, and frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in Trizol. RNA was isolated and checked by agarose gel-electrophoresis. Samples were then sent to the Microarray Core Facility at Weill Cornell Medical College.","While microarray experiments generate voluminous data, discerning trends that support an existing or alternative paradigm is challenging. To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis. Thus, the PADMA database will be a useful resource to fly researchers to evaluate, revise, and refine hypotheses.","['Animals', 'Computational Biology', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Database', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis']"

BDADs (Bis-(dichloroacetyl)-diamines) have been shown previously to inhibit spermatogenesis and function as male contraceptives in many species; however, their mechanism of action has yet to be fully described.  Results provide insight into the ability of WIN 18,446 to inhibit retinoic acid synthesis in the murine testis.
Testes were removed from 2dpp 129 mice and cultured for 24h in an organ culture mold in the presence of WIN 18,446.  Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.","Bis-(dichloroacetyl)-diamines (BDADs) are compounds that inhibit spermatogenesis and function as male contraceptives in many species; however, their mechanism of action has yet to be fully investigated. It has been proposed that BDADs may function via inhibition of testicular retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis. We employed an organ culture technique and the expression of a marker for RA activity, Stra8 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8), to investigate if the BDAD WIN 18,446 inhibited the biosynthesis of RA from retinol (ROL) in neonatal and adult murine testis and in the embryonic murine gonad. After culturing either whole testes or germ cells isolated from mice at 2 days postpartum (dpp) with WIN 18,446 or with WIN 18,446 plus ROL, Stra8 expression was suppressed, demonstrating that WIN 18,446 inhibited the conversion of ROL to RA in both systems. We also utilized a transgenic mouse containing an RA-responsive LacZ reporter gene to demonstrate limited RA induction of LacZ expression in 2-dpp testes cultured with WIN 18,446 plus ROL. The expression of Stra8 was downregulated in adult mouse testis tubules cultured with WIN 18,446 when compared to tubules cultured with the vehicle control. WIN 18,446 also inhibited the conversion of ROL to RA in embryonic ovaries and testes cultured for 48 h. These murine results provide critical insights regarding how the BDADs can inhibit spermatogenesis by blocking the ability of vitamin A to drive germ cell development. In addition, these techniques will be useful for screening novel inhibitors of RA biosynthesis as potential male contraceptives.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contraceptive Agents, Male/*pharmacology', 'Diamines/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Ovary/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Spermatozoa/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/*drug effects/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/metabolism']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Proteins', 'Protein signature', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Gene report', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Report', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Organelles', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'Dermatology', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'Tree dating']"

Total RNA obtained from undifferentiated hESCs, iPSCs, HLCs (hepatocyte-like cells)-derived from hESCs and iPSCs, fetal forskin fibroblasts and fetal liver.","Hepatocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could provide a defined and renewable source of human cells relevant for cell replacement therapies and toxicology studies. However, before patient-specific iPSCs can be routinely used for these purposes, there is a dire need to critically compare these cells to the golden standard--hESCs. In this study, we aimed at investigating the differences and similarities at the transcriptional level between hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from both hESCs and iPSCs. Two independent protocols for deriving HLCs from hESCs and iPSCs were adopted and further characterization included immunocytochemistry, real-time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro functional assays. Comparative microarray-based gene expression profiling was conducted on these cells and compared to the transcriptomes of human fetal liver and adult liver progenitors. HLCs derived from hESCs and human iPSCs showed significant functional similarities, similar expression of genes important for liver physiology and common pathways. However, specific differences between the 2 cell types could be observed. For example, among the cytochrome P450 gene family, CYP19A1, CYP1A1, and CYP11A1 were enriched in hESC-derived HLCs, and CYP46A1 and CYP26A1 in iPSC-derived HLCs. HLCs derived from hESCs and human iPSCs exhibited broad similarities but as well meaningful differences. We identified common upregulated transcription factors, which might serve as a source for generating a cocktail of factors able to directly transdifferentiate somatic cells into HLCs.

22847234,"Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling regulates differentiation of many cell types. During myogenesis in particular, p38a MAPK (MAPK14) phosphorylates multiple transcriptional regulators to modulate muscle-specific gene expression. Among the p38a MAPK modulated genes is the muscle-specific transcriptional regulator Myogenin (Myog) that is also essential to complete the muscle differentiation program, and while it is known that both p38a MAPK and Myog are critically required for myogenesis, the individual contribution of each of these proteins is poorly defined. Here we show that Myog expression (in the absence of p38a MAPK signaling) is sufficient to establish expression of many late markers of muscle differentiation and to mediate cell migration. However, Myog expression alone did not led to the formation of multinucleated muscle cells, highlighting a critical role for p38a MAPK in myoblast fusion. Using comparative microarray analysis we identified p38a MAPK-dependent genes that are not regulated by Myog
We generated a stable C2C12-derived cell line (C2i-Myog) that expresses a Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible cDNA encoding Flag-tagged Myog. In this system, the chemical induction of exogenous Myog (Dox) combined with the pharmacological inhibition of p38a/b MAPK signaling by SB203580 (SB) would allow us to assess the functional contribution of these two pathways during myogenesis","Skeletal muscle differentiation is mediated by a complex gene expression program requiring both the muscle-specific transcription factor Myogenin (Myog) and p38α MAPK (p38α) signaling. However, the relative contribution of Myog and p38α to the formation of mature myotubes remains unknown. Here, we have uncoupled the activity of Myog from that of p38α to gain insight into the individual roles of these proteins in myogenesis. Comparative expression profiling confirmed that Myog activates the expression of genes involved in muscle function. Furthermore, we found that in the absence of p38α signaling, Myog expression leads to the down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Consistent with this, the expression of Myog is sufficient to induce cell cycle exit. Interestingly, p38α-defective, Myog-expressing myoblasts fail to form multinucleated myotubes, suggesting an important role for p38α in cell fusion. Through the analysis of p38α up-regulated genes, the tetraspanin CD53 was identified as a candidate fusion protein, a role confirmed both ex vivo in primary myoblasts, and in vivo during myofiber regeneration in mice. Thus, our study has revealed an unexpected role for Myog in mediating cell cycle exit and has identified an essential role for p38α in cell fusion through the up-regulation of CD53.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/*genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle Development/*genetics/*physiology', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/metabolism/physiology', 'Myoblasts, Skeletal/metabolism/*physiology', 'Myogenin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Regeneration/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Tetraspanin 25/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Kinase name', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia's genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication.

28566333,CDK4 phosphorylation status and a linked gene expression profile predict sensitivity to Palbociclib [lines],"Cyclin D-CDK4/6 are the first CDK complexes to be activated in the G1 phase in response to oncogenic pathways. The specific CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 (palbociclib) was recently approved by the FDA and EMA for treatment of advanced ER-positive breast tumors. Unfortunately, no reliable predictive tools are available for identifying potentially responsive or insensitive tumors. We had shown that the activating T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 is the central rate-limiting event that initiates the cell cycle decision and signals the presence of active CDK4. Here, we report that the profile of post-translational modification including T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 differs among breast tumors and associates with their subtypes and risk. A gene expression signature faithfully predicted CDK4 modification profiles in tumors and cell lines. Moreover, in breast cancer cell lines, the CDK4 T172 phosphorylation best correlated with sensitivity to PD0332991.

27799328,The ω Subunit Governs RNA Polymerase Stability and Transcriptional Specificity in Staphylococcus aureus,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that causes infection in a wide variety of sites within the human body. Its ability to adapt to the human host and to produce a successful infection requires precise orchestration of gene expression. While DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is generally well characterized, the roles of several small accessory subunits within the complex have yet to be fully explored. This is particularly true for the omega (ω or RpoZ) subunit, which has been extensively studied in Gram-negative bacteria but largely neglected in Gram-positive counterparts. In Escherichia coli, it has been shown that ppGpp binding, and thus control of the stringent response, is facilitated by ω. Interestingly, key residues that facilitate ppGpp binding by ω are not conserved in S. aureus, and consequently, survival under starvation conditions is unaffected by rpoZ deletion. Further to this, ω-lacking strains of S. aureus display structural changes in the RNAP complex, which result from increased degradation and misfolding of the β' subunit, alterations in δ and σ factor abundance, and a general dissociation of RNAP in the absence of ω. Through RNA sequencing analysis we detected a variety of transcriptional changes in the rpoZ-deficient strain, presumably as a response to the negative effects of ω depletion on the transcription machinery. These transcriptional changes translated to an impaired ability of the rpoZ mutant to resist stress and to fully form a biofilm. Collectively, our data underline, for the first time, the importance of ω for RNAP stability, function, and cellular physiology in S. aureus IMPORTANCE: In order for bacteria to adjust to changing environments, such as within the host, the transcriptional process must be tightly controlled. Transcription is carried out by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). In addition to its major subunits (α<sub>2</sub>ββ') a fifth, smaller subunit, ω, is present in all forms of life. Although this small subunit is well studied in eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, only limited information is available for Gram-positive and pathogenic species. In this study, we investigated the structural and functional importance of ω, revealing key roles in subunit folding/stability, complex assembly, and maintenance of transcriptional integrity.

Pax7 binds its targeted enhancers rapidly, but chromatin remodeling and gene activation are slower. Enhancers opened by Pax7 show a loss of DNA methylation and acquire stable epigenetic memory, as evidenced by binding of nonpioneer factors after Pax7 withdrawal.

Despite containing the same DNA-binding domain, the two fusion proteins display distinct binding patterns, show differences in gene expression and chromatin landscape, and are dependent on different transcription factors. RUNX1-EVI1 directs a stem cell-like transcriptional network reliant on GATA2, whereas that of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells is more mature and depends on RUNX1.

PU.1 and Spi-B are E26-transformation-specific transcription factors that are critical for B cell differentiation. To determine whether PU.1 and Spi-B are required for B cell development in the bone marrow, Spi1 (encoding PU.1) was conditionally deleted in B cells by Cre recombinase under control of the Mb1 gene in Spib (encoding Spi-B)-deficient mice. Combined deletion of Spi1 and Spib resulted in a lack of mature B cells in the spleen and a block in B cell development in the bone marrow at the small pre-B cell stage. To determine target genes of PU.1 that could explain this block, we applied a gain-of-function approach using a PU.1/Spi-B-deficient pro-B cell line in which PU.1 can be induced by doxycycline. PU.1-induced genes were identified by integration of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data. We found that PU.1 interacted with multiple sites in the Igκ locus, including Vκ promoters and regions located downstream of Vκ second exons. Induction of PU.1 induced Igκ transcription and rearrangement. Upregulation of Igκ transcription was impaired in small pre-B cells from PU.1/Spi-B-deficient bone marrow.

27840021,Conversion of terminally committed mouse hepatocytes to culturable bipotent progenitor cells,"A challenge for advancing approaches to liver regeneration is loss of functional differentiation capacity when hepatocyte progenitors are maintained in culture. Recent lineage-tracing studies have shown that mature hepatocytes (MHs) convert to an immature state during chronic liver injury, and we investigated whether this conversion could be recapitulated in vitro and whether such converted cells could represent a source of expandable hepatocytes. We report that a cocktail of small molecules, Y-27632, A-83-01, and CHIR99021, can convert rat and mouse MHs in vitro into proliferative bipotent cells, which we term chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs). CLiPs can differentiate into both MHs and biliary epithelial cells that can form functional ductal structures.

27655916,Transcriptional responses in 6.5 dpf larval zebrafish guts upon feeding a high-fat or low-fat meal,"Responding to a high-fat meal requires an interplay between multiple digestive tissues, sympathetic response pathways, and the gut microbiome. The epithelial enterocytes of the intestine are responsible for absorbing dietary nutrients and preparing them for circulation to distal tissues, which requires significant changes in cellular activity, including both morphological and transcriptional responses. Following a high-fat meal, we observe morphological changes in the enterocytes of larval zebrafish, including elongation of mitochondria, formation and expansion of lipid droplets, and the rapid and transient ruffling of the nuclear periphery. Dietary and pharmacological manipulation of zebrafish larvae demonstrated that these subcellular changes are specific to triglyceride absorption. The transcriptional changes that occur simultaneously with these morphological changes were determined using RNA sequencing, revealing a cohort of up-regulated genes associated with lipid droplet formation and lipid transport via lipoprotein particles. Using a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor to block β-lipoprotein particle formation, we demonstrate that the transcriptional response to a high-fat meal is associated with the transfer of ER triglyceride to nascent β-lipoproteins, possibly through the activation of Creb3l3/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein. These data suggest that a transient increase in ER lipids is the likely mediator of the initial physiological response of intestinal enterocytes to dietary lipid.","['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', '*Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enterocytes/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Lipid Droplets/metabolism', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Triglycerides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish/genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Plasmid map', 'Lipid report', 'Lipid structure', 'LIPID MAPS ID', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Fish', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
28102347,Response to low-level phage predation in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms,"An important lesson from the war on pathogenic bacteria has been the need to understand the physiological responses and evolution of natural microbial communities. Bacterial populations in the environment are generally forming biofilms subject to some level of phage predation. These multicellular communities are notoriously resistant to antimicrobials and, consequently, very difficult to eradicate. This has sparked the search for new therapeutic alternatives, including phage therapy. This study demonstrates that S. aureus biofilms formed in the presence of a non-lethal dose of phage phiIPLA-RODI exhibit a unique physiological state that could potentially benefit both the host and the predator. Thus, biofilms formed under phage pressure are thicker and have a greater DNA content. Also, the virus-infected biofilm displayed major transcriptional differences compared to an untreated control. Significantly, RNA-seq data revealed activation of the stringent response, which could slow down the advance of the bacteriophage within the biofilm. The end result would be an equilibrium that would help bacterial cells to withstand environmental challenges, while maintaining a reservoir of sensitive bacterial cells available to the phage upon reactivation of the dormant carrier population.","['*Bacteriolysis', 'Biofilms/*growth & development', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Staphylococcus Phages/*growth & development', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*physiology/*virology', '*Stress, Physiological']","['Analysis', 'Protein-protein interaction analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'BioJSON (BioXSD)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein residue interactions', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Locus ID', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model accession']"

Refer to individual Series","Precise control of the innate immune response is essential to ensure host defense against infection while avoiding inflammatory disease. Systems-level analyses of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-stimulated macrophages suggested that SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN) might play a role in the TLR pathway. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that macrophages derived from chronic proliferative dermatitis mutation (cpdm) mice, which harbor a spontaneous null mutation in the Sharpin gene, exhibited impaired IL-12 production in response to TLR activation. Systems biology approaches were used to define the SHARPIN-regulated networks. Promoter analysis identified NF-κB and AP-1 as candidate transcription factors downstream of SHARPIN, and network analysis suggested selective attenuation of these pathways. We found that the effects of SHARPIN deficiency on the TLR2-induced transcriptome were strikingly correlated with the effects of the recently described hypomorphic L153P/panr2 point mutation in Ikbkg [NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO)], suggesting that SHARPIN and NEMO interact. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation analysis and furthermore found it to be abrogated by panr2. NEMO-dependent signaling was affected by SHARPIN deficiency in a manner similar to the panr2 mutation, including impaired p105 and ERK phosphorylation and p65 nuclear localization. Interestingly, SHARPIN deficiency had no effect on IκBα degradation and on p38 and JNK phosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SHARPIN is an essential adaptor downstream of the branch point defined by the panr2 mutation in NEMO.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Systems biology', 'Biology', 'Biological system modelling', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

The PBMC layer was lysed with RLT buffer, homogenized, and then stored at –80°C. Total RNA was extracted as per RNeasy‚ Midi protocol (Qiagen). Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (5 to 20 µg) using 7-d(T)24  primer and SuperScript‰ Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit and purified by phase lock gel-phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription using HighYield‰ RNA Transcript Labeling Kit followed by fragmentation with 5X fragmentation buffer.  Fragmented cRNA (10 µg) was hybridized to Affymetrix Hu95Av2 oligonucleotide probe arrays for 16 h at 45∞C.  After removal of hybridization fluid, the arrays were washed, stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin (SAPE), and signal amplified by anti-streptavidin antibody using Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.  Probe set signals were measured using Agilent GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix‚, Santa Clara, CA).","To define gene expression profiles that occur during the initial activation of human innate immunity, we administered intravenous endotoxin (n = 8) or saline (n = 4) to healthy subjects and hybridized RNA from blood mononuclear cells (0, 0.5, 6, 24, 168 h) or whole blood (0, 3, 6, 24, 168 h) to oligonucleotide probe arrays. The greatest change in mononuclear cell gene expression occurred at 6 h (439 induced and 428 repressed genes, 1% false discovery rate, and 50% fold change) including increased expression of genes associated with pathogen recognition molecules and signaling cascades linked to receptors associated with cell mobility and activation. Induced defense response genes included cytokines, chemokines, and their respective receptors, acute-phase transcription factors, proteases, arachidonate metabolites, and oxidases. Repressed defense response genes included those associated with co-stimulatory molecules, T and cytotoxic lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and protein synthesis. Gene expression profiles of whole blood had similar biological themes. Over 100 genes not typically associated with acute inflammation were differentially regulated after endotoxin. By 24 h, gene expression had returned to baseline values. Thus the inflammatory response of circulating leukocytes to endotoxin in humans is characterized by a rapid amplification and subsidence of gene expression.

Refer to individual Series","A key question concerns the mechanisms that determine temporal identity in stem cells. Fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differ from adult HSCs in terms of gene expression profile, surface marker expression, differentiation, and self-renewal capacity. We previously showed that the transcription factor SOX17 is expressed by fetal, but not adult, HSCs and is required for the maintenance of fetal and neonatal, but not adult, HSCs. In the current study, we show that ectopic expression of Sox17 in adult HSCs and transiently reconstituting multipotent progenitors was sufficient to confer increased self-renewal potential and the expression of fetal HSC genes, including fetal HSC surface markers. Sox17 expression enabled transiently reconstituting adult progenitors to give long-term multilineage reconstitution that resembled fetal hematopoiesis, including increased erythropoiesis, increased myelopoiesis, and decreased lymphopoiesis. Long-term ectopic expression of Sox17 eventually led to leukemogenesis.

In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here we analyse circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> primary tumours, 84% of whom had acquired circulating tumour cells expressing HER2. Cultured circulating tumour cells maintain discrete HER2<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>-</sup> subpopulations: HER2<sup>+</sup> circulating tumour cells are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2, consistent with activation of multiple signalling pathways; HER2<sup>-</sup> circulating tumour cells show activation of Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, but sensitivity to Notch inhibition. HER2<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>-</sup> circulating tumour cells interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one phenotype producing daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. Although HER2<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>-</sup> circulating tumour cells have comparable tumour initiating potential, differential proliferation favours the HER2<sup>+</sup> state, while oxidative stress or cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2<sup>-</sup> phenotype. Simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained suppression of tumorigenesis in orthotopic circulating tumour cell-derived tumour models.

27551092,Desiccation Tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds,"Desiccation tolerance (DT) is a remarkable process that allows seeds in the dry state to remain viable for long periods of time that in some instances exceed 1,000 y. It has been postulated that seed DT evolved by rewiring the regulatory and signaling networks that controlled vegetative DT, which itself emerged as a crucial adaptive trait of early land plants. Understanding the networks that regulate seed desiccation tolerance in model plant systems would provide the tools to understand an evolutionary process that played a crucial role in the diversification of flowering plants. In this work, we used an integrated approach that included genomics, bioinformatics, metabolomics, and molecular genetics to identify and validate molecular networks that control the acquisition of DT in Arabidopsis seeds. Two DT-specific transcriptional subnetworks were identified related to storage of reserve compounds and cellular protection mechanisms that act downstream of the embryo development master regulators LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 and 2, FUSCA 3, and ABSCICIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3. Among the transcription factors identified as major nodes in the DT regulatory subnetworks, PLATZ1, PLATZ2, and AGL67 were confirmed by knockout mutants and overexpression in a desiccation-intolerant mutant background to play an important role in seed DT.

Many of these infections are caused by an inherent ability of the pathogen to form biofilms on medical devices resulting in high mortality. Biofilms formed by C. albicans are a complex consortium of yeast and hyphal cells embedded in an extracellular matrix and are regulated by a network of transcription factors. Here, we report the role of a novel Zn(II)2-Cys6 binuclear cluster transcription factor, ZCF32, in the regulation of biofilm formation. Global transcriptome analysis reveals that biofilm development is the most altered pathway in the zcf32 null mutant. To delineate the functional correlation between ZCF32 and biofilm development, we determined the set of genes directly regulated by Zcf32. Our data suggests that Zcf32 regulates biofilm formation by repressing the expression of adhesins, chitinases and a significant number of other GPI-anchored proteins. We establish that there is the lesser recruitment of Zcf32 on the promoters of biofilm genes in biofilm condition compared to the planktonic mode of growth. Taking together, we propose that the transcription factor ZCF32 negatively regulates biofilm development in C. albicans.","['Biofilms/*growth & development', 'Candida albicans/*physiology', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Cluster analysis identified 6 TNBC subtypes displaying unique GE and ontologies, including 2 basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Further, GE analysis allowed us to identify TNBC cell line models representative of these subtypes. Predicted ""driver"" signaling pathways were pharmacologically targeted in these cell line models as proof of concept that analysis of distinct GE signatures can inform therapy selection. BL1 and BL2 subtypes had higher expression of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes, and representative cell lines preferentially responded to cisplatin. M and MSL subtypes were enriched in GE for epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and growth factor pathways and cell models responded to NVP-BEZ235 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) and dasatinib (an abl/src inhibitor). The LAR subtype includes patients with decreased relapse-free survival and was characterized by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. LAR cell lines were uniquely sensitive to bicalutamide (an AR antagonist). These data may be useful in biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial design that will enable alignment of TNBC patients to appropriate targeted therapies.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/classification/*drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'BEAST', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Statistical estimate score', 'Copy number estimation', 'Multiple testing correction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Transposon prediction']"

We recently showed that a large SR protein called Son has unique repeat motifs that are essential for maintaining the subnuclear organization of pre-mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Motif analysis of Son highlights putative RNA interaction domains that suggest a direct role for Son in pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we used in situ approaches to show that Son localizes to a reporter minigene transcription site, and that RNAi-mediated Son depletion causes exon skipping on reporter transcripts at this transcription site. A genome-wide exon microarray analysis was performed to identify human transcription and splicing targets of Son. Our data show that Son-regulated splicing encompasses all known types of alternative splicing, the most common being alternative splicing of cassette exons. We confirmed that knockdown of Son leads to exon skipping in pre-mRNAs for chromatin-modifying enzymes, including ADA, HDAC6 and SetD8.

Loneliness-associated genes derived primarily from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and, to a lesser extent, B lymphocytes. Those dynamics reflected per-cell changes in the expression of inducible genes and related more strongly to the subjective experience of loneliness than to objective social network size.

In the present study we show that the addition of glucose to the medium improves the growth of wild-type cells at high pH, fully abolishes the snf1 alkali-sensitive phenotype and attenuates high pH-induced Snf1 phosphorylation at Thr(210). Lack of Elm1, one of the three upstream Snf1 kinases (Tos3, Elm1 and Sak1), markedly increases alkali sensitivity, whereas the phenotype of the triple mutant tos3 elm1 sak1 is even more pronounced than that of snf1 cells and is poorly rescued by glucose supplementation. DNA microarray analysis reveals that about 75% of the genes induced in the short term by high pH are also induced by glucose scarcity. Snf1 mediates, in full or in part, the activation of a significant subset (38%) of short-term alkali-induced genes, including those encoding high-affinity hexose transporters and phosphorylating enzymes. The induction of genes encoding enzymes involved in glycogen, but not trehalose, metabolism is largely dependent of the presence of Snf1. Therefore the function of Snf1 in adaptation to glucose scarcity appears crucial for alkaline pH tolerance. Incorporation of micromolar amounts of iron and copper to a glucose-supplemented medium resulted in an additive effect and allows near-normal growth at high pH, thus indicating that these three nutrients are key limiting factors for growth in an alkaline environment.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Fungi', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Concentration', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Vienna RNA concentration data', 'Operon', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'Protein threading', 'Protein databases', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Proteins', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Mathematical model', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
27125778,Base J represses genes at the end of polycistronic gene clusters in Leishmania major by promoting RNAP II termination [RNA-seq],"The genomes of kinetoplastids are organized into polycistronic gene clusters that are flanked by the modified DNA base J. Previous work has established a role of base J in promoting RNA polymerase II termination in Leishmania spp. where the loss of J leads to termination defects and transcription into adjacent gene clusters. It remains unclear whether these termination defects affect gene expression and whether read through transcription is detrimental to cell growth, thus explaining the essential nature of J. We now demonstrate that reduction of base J at specific sites within polycistronic gene clusters in L. major leads to read through transcription and increased expression of downstream genes in the cluster. Interestingly, subsequent transcription into the opposing polycistronic gene cluster does not lead to downregulation of sense mRNAs. These findings indicate a conserved role for J regulating transcription termination and expression of genes within polycistronic gene clusters in trypanosomatids. In contrast to the expectations often attributed to opposing transcription, the essential nature of J in Leishmania spp. is related to its role in gene repression rather than preventing transcriptional interference resulting from read through and dual strand transcription.","['Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucosides/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leishmania major/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Uracil/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']","['Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Leishmania major)', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
22761427,Differential expression of microRNAs between oral squamous cell carcinoma and healthy control tongues,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression during many biological processes. Recently, the aberrant expressions of miRNAs have become a major focus in cancer research. The purpose of this study was to identify deregulated miRNAs in oral cancer and further focus on specific miRNAs that were related to patient survival. Here, we report that miRNA expression profiling provided more precise information when oral squamous cell carcinomas were subcategorized on the basis of clinicopathological parameters (tumor primary site, histological subtype, tumor stage, and HPV16 status). An innovative radar chart analysis method was developed to depict subcategories of cancers taking into consideration the expression patterns of multiple miRNAs combined with the clinicopathological parameters. Keratinization of tumors and the high expression of miR-21 were the major factors related to the poor prognosis of patients. Interestingly, a majority of the keratinized tumors expressed high levels of miR-21. Further investigations demonstrated the regulation of the tumor suppressor gene reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) by two keratinization-associated miRNAs, miR-7 and miR-21. Transfection of miR-7 and miR-21-mimics reduced the expression of RECK through direct miRNA-mediated regulation, and these miRNAs were inversely correlated with RECK in CAL 27 orthotopic xenograft tumors. Furthermore, a similar inverse correlation was demonstrated in CAL 27 cells treated in vitro by different external stimuli such as trypsinization, cell density, and serum concentration. Taken together, our data show that keratinization is associated with poor prognosis of oral cancer patients and keratinization-associated miRNAs mediate deregulation of RECK which may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumors.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Linked data format', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Transposon prediction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Tumor annotation']"

One solution is to derive induced pluripotent stem cells from patients and differentiate them into neurons affected by disease. Triplication of SNCA, encoding α-synuclein, causes a fully penetrant, aggressive form of Parkinson's disease with dementia. α-Synuclein dysfunction is the critical pathogenic event in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. Here we produce multiple induced pluripotent stem cell lines from an SNCA triplication patient and an unaffected first-degree relative. When these cells are differentiated into midbrain dopaminergic neurons, those from the patient produce double the amount of α-synuclein protein as neurons from the unaffected relative, precisely recapitulating the cause of Parkinson's disease in these individuals. This model represents a new experimental system to identify compounds that reduce levels of α-synuclein, and to investigate the mechanistic basis of neurodegeneration caused by α-synuclein dysfunction.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Parkinson Disease/*genetics/metabolism', 'alpha-Synuclein/*genetics/*metabolism']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene ID', 'Gene map', 'Gene name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Protein chain (C-alpha atoms)', 'Protein domain (C-alpha atoms)']"

Such coordination ensures genomic integrity while cells somatically rearrange their antigen receptor genes [in a process called variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination] and, upon successful rearrangement, expands the pools of progenitor lymphocytes. Here we show that in developing B lymphocytes, the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 are critical for maintaining quiescence before precursor B cell receptor (pre-BCR) expression and for reestablishing quiescence after pre-BCR-induced expansion. These RBPs suppress an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional regulon consisting of messenger RNAs whose protein products cooperatively promote transition into the S phase of the cell cycle.

Data analysis was performed using the GeneSpring Software 7.0. Selected genes showing significant differential expression were validated by Quantitative real-time PCR in nonamplified RNA.Cultured HTM cells retained the expression of some genes characteristic of the HTM tissue, including chitinase 3-like 1 and matrix Gla protein, but demonstrated downregulation of physiologically important genes such as myocilin. POAG HTM tissue showed relatively small changes compared to that of control donors. These changes included the statistically significant upregulation of several genes associated with inflammation and acute-phase response, including selectin-E (ELAM-I), as well as the downregulation of the antioxidants, paraoxonase 3 and ceruloplasmin.Downregulation in cultured HTM cells of genes potentially relevant for outflow pathway function highlights the importance of developing new conditions for the culture of TM cells capable of preserving the characteristics of TM cells in vivo.

In this study, we dynamically and globally dissect the alteration of key pathways in the development from colitis to colorectal cancer. Striking evidence from gene expression profiling, serum cytokines detection, and immunohistochemistry analysis all reveals that different key pathways [NF-κB, STAT3, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt/β-catenin signaling] and their target genes are hyperactive in different phases of the inflammation-cancer link. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and STAT3 signaling are hyperactive in the whole process, while p38 MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling are only hyperactive in the beginning and ending, respectively.

The mechanisms governing these rhythms are not well understood, particularly the distinct contributions of the cell-autonomous clock and central pacemaker to rhythmic liver physiology. Through microarray expression profiling in Met murine hepatocytes (MMH)-D3, we identified over 1,000 transcripts that exhibit circadian oscillations, demonstrating that the cell-autonomous clock can drive many rhythms, and that MMH-D3 is a valid circadian model system. The genes represented by these circadian transcripts displayed both cophasic and antiphasic organization within a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting the existence of competition for binding sites or partners by genes of disparate transcriptional phases. Multiple pathways displayed enrichment in MMH-D3 circadian transcripts, including the polyamine synthesis module of the glutathione metabolic pathway. The polyamine synthesis module, which is highly associated with cell proliferation and whose products are required for initiation of liver regeneration, includes enzymes whose transcripts exhibit circadian oscillations, such as ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase. Metabolic profiling revealed that the enzymatic product of spermidine synthase, spermidine, cycles as well. Thus, the cell-autonomous hepatocyte clock can drive a significant amount of transcriptional rhythms and orchestrate physiologically relevant modules such as polyamine synthesis.","['Animals', 'Biogenic Polyamines/*biosynthesis', '*Circadian Rhythm', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Here we use whole-genome sequencing data to map SVs across 600 tumors and 18 cancers, and investigate the relationship between SVs, copy number alterations (CNAs), and mRNA expression. We find that 34% of CNA breakpoints can be clarified structurally and that most amplifications are due to tandem duplications. We observe frequent swapping of strong and weak promoters in the context of gene fusions, and find that this has a measurable global impact on mRNA levels. Interestingly, several long noncoding RNAs were strongly activated by this mechanism. Additionally, SVs were confirmed in telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT) upstream regions in several cancers, associated with elevated TERT mRNA levels. We also highlight high-confidence gene fusions supported by both genomic and transcriptomic evidence, including a previously undescribed paired box 8 (PAX8)-nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) fusion in thyroid carcinoma.

A high-quality genome sequence assembly of diploid Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the wheat D genome, will provide a useful platform to study polyploid wheat evolution. A combined approach of BAC pooling and next-generation sequencing technology was employed to sequence the minimum tiling path (MTP) of 3176 BAC clones from the short arm of Ae. tauschii chromosome 3 (At3DS). The final assembly of 135 super-scaffolds with an N50 of 4.2 Mb was used to build a 247-Mb pseudomolecule with a total of 2222 predicted protein-coding genes. Compared with the orthologous regions of rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum, At3DS contains 38.67% more genes. In comparison to At3DS, the short arm sequence of wheat chromosome 3B (Ta3BS) is 95-Mb large in size, which is primarily due to the expansion of the non-centromeric region, suggesting that transposable element (TE) bursts in Ta3B likely occurred there. Also, the size increase is accompanied by a proportional increase in gene number in Ta3BS. We found that in the sequence of short arm of wheat chromosome 3D (Ta3DS), there was only less than 0.27% gene loss compared to At3DS.

Moreover, dispersal by flight is essential for the viability of species living in fragmented landscapes. Here, working on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), we use transcriptome sequencing to investigate gene expression changes caused by 15 min of flight in two contrasting populations and the two sexes. Male butterflies and individuals from a large metapopulation had significantly higher peak flight metabolic rate (FMR) than female butterflies and those from a small inbred population. In the pooled data, FMR was significantly positively correlated with genome-wide heterozygosity, a surrogate of individual inbreeding. The flight experiment changed the expression level of 1513 genes, including genes related to major energy metabolism pathways, ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, and stress and immune responses. Males and butterflies from the population with high FMR had higher basal expression of genes related to energy metabolism, whereas females and butterflies from the small population with low FMR had higher expression of genes related to ribosome/RNA processing and immune response. Following the flight treatment, genes related to energy metabolism were generally down-regulated, while genes related to ribosome/RNA processing and immune response were up-regulated. These results suggest that common molecular mechanisms respond to flight and can influence differences in flight metabolic capacity between populations and sexes.","['Animals', 'Butterflies/*genetics/physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/genetics', 'Female', 'Finland', '*Flight, Animal', '*Gene Expression', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Sex Characteristics', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Flies', 'Drug metabolism', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'ELAND format', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'MAT', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Ancestral reconstruction', 'Phylogenetic character data', 'Sequence mask character', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

24269915,"To get insight into systemic molecular events associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, we compared gene expression patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from elderly healhy controls and from PD patients.
Transcriptomic profiling of patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. RNA were extracted from peripheral mononuclear blood cells and were hybridized on 4x44k Agilent expression microarrays.","The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation is a common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although patients with sporadic PD and individuals with LRRK2-linked PD display the classical PD phenotype, it is not known whether or not the same biological pathways are deregulated in each context. By using transcriptome profiling, we investigated the deregulation of various biological pathways in a total of 47 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with sporadic PD, patients heterozygous for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation compared to healthy controls. We found that the deregulation patterns were indeed similar in PBMCs obtained from patients with sporadic PD and from LRRK2 G2019S carriers, with dysfunctions in mitochondrial pathways, cell survival signaling, cancerization, endocytosis signaling and iron metabolism. Analysis of our PBMC data and other publicly available transcriptome datasets (for whole blood samples) showed that deregulation of the immune system, endocytosis and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) signaling are the main features of transcriptome profiles in PD (since they are also present in the transcriptome of dopaminergic neurons from patients). Transcriptome analysis of PBMCs is thus valuable for (i) characterizing the pathophysiological pathways shared by genetic and sporadic forms of PD and (ii) identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This minimally invasive approach opens up tremendous perspectives for better diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases because it can be applied from the earliest stages of the disease onwards.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Endocytosis/*genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*physiopathology', 'Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', '*Parkinson Disease/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunogenetics', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Protein repeat signature', 'protein', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

22152676,Shared and unique components of human population structure and genome-wide signals of positive selection in South Asia,"South Asia harbors one of the highest levels genetic diversity in Eurasia, which could be interpreted as a result of its long-term large effective population size and of admixture during its complex demographic history. In contrast to Pakistani populations, populations of Indian origin have been underrepresented in previous genomic scans of positive selection and population structure. Here we report data for more than 600,000 SNP markers genotyped in 142 samples from 30 ethnic groups in India. Combining our results with other available genome-wide data, we show that Indian populations are characterized by two major ancestry components, one of which is spread at comparable frequency and haplotype diversity in populations of South and West Asia and the Caucasus. The second component is more restricted to South Asia and accounts for more than 50% of the ancestry in Indian populations. Haplotype diversity associated with these South Asian ancestry components is significantly higher than that of the components dominating the West Eurasian ancestry palette. Modeling of the observed haplotype diversities suggests that both Indian ancestry components are older than the purported Indo-Aryan invasion 3,500 YBP. Consistent with the results of pairwise genetic distances among world regions, Indians share more ancestry signals with West than with East Eurasians. However, compared to Pakistani populations, a higher proportion of their genes show regionally specific signals of high haplotype homozygosity. Among such candidates of positive selection in India are MSTN and DOK5, both of which have potential implications in lipid metabolism and the etiology of type 2 diabetes.","['Asia', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Haplotypes', 'Heredity', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Phylogeography', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Principal Component Analysis', '*Selection, Genetic']","['Type', 'Cell type accession', 'Map type', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Phenotype name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic engineering', 'PHYLIP format', 'Tomography', 'Physical mapping', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Analysis', 'Selection detection', 'Feature selection', 'Genetic mapping']"

The current focus of our research is to understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. In this study, we employed a proteomics approach to identify novel genes involved in the fumonisin biosynthesis under nitrogen stress. The combination of genome sequence, mutant strains, EST database, microarrays, and proteomics offers an opportunity to advance our understanding of this process. We investigated the response of the G. moniliformis proteome in limited nitrogen (N0, fumonisininducing) and excess nitrogen (N+, fumonisin-repressing) conditions by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. We selected 11 differentially expressed proteins, six from limited nitrogen conditions and five from excess nitrogen conditions, and determined the sequences by peptide mass fingerprinting and MS/MS spectrophotometry. Subsequently, we identified the EST sequences corresponding to the proteins and studied their expression profiles in different culture conditions. Through the comparative analysis of gene and protein expression data, we identified three candidate genes for functional analysis and our results provided valuable clues regarding the regulatory mechanisms of fumonisin biosynthesis.","['Biosynthetic Pathways/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fumonisins/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Fungal', 'Gibberella/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nitrogen/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis']","['Pathway ID (Panther)', 'Synthetic biology', 'Panther Pathways entry format', 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Electron density map', 'Sequence', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence map', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Functional genomics', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein']"
24039603,Ecotype specific nitrogen responses in the Arabidopsis root,"Plant development is remarkably plastic but how precisely can the plant customize its form to specific environments? When the plant adjusts its development to different environments, related traits can change in a coordinated fashion, such that two traits co-vary across many genotypes. Alternatively, traits can vary independently, such that a change in one trait has little predictive value for the change in a second trait. To characterize such ""tunability"" in developmental plasticity, we carried out a detailed phenotypic characterization of complex root traits among 96 accessions of the model Arabidopsis thaliana in two nitrogen environments. The results revealed a surprising level of independence in the control of traits to environment - a highly tunable form of plasticity. We mapped genetic architecture of plasticity using genome-wide association studies and further used gene expression analysis to narrow down gene candidates in mapped regions. Mutants in genes implicated by association and expression analysis showed precise defects in the predicted traits in the predicted environment, corroborating the independent control of plasticity traits. The overall results suggest that there is a pool of genetic variability in plants that controls traits in specific environments, with opportunity to tune crop plants to a given environment.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Mutation', 'Nitrogen/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Development/*genetics', 'Plant Roots/genetics/metabolism', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome name', 'Chromosome report', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Protein interaction data', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Phylogenetic continuous quantitative data']"
23144617,Early Mechanisms of Pathobiology are Revealed by Transcriptional Temporal Dynamics in Hippocampal CA1 Neurons of Prion Infected Mice,"Prion diseases typically have long pre-clinical incubation periods during which time the infectious prion particle and infectivity steadily propagate in the brain. Abnormal neuritic sprouting and synaptic deficits are apparent during pre-clinical disease, however, gross neuronal loss is not detected until the onset of the clinical phase. The molecular events that accompany early neuronal damage and ultimately conclude with neuronal death remain obscure. In this study, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and determined their pre-clinical transcriptional response during infection. We found that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. We found that a major cluster of genes is altered during pre-clinical disease after which expression either returns to basal levels, or alternatively undergoes a direct reversal during clinical disease. Strikingly, we show that this cluster contains a signature highly reminiscent of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and the activation of neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered throughout the disease, culminating in a general decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Similarly, deregulated miRNAs such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-140-5p follow concomitant patterns of expression. This is the first in depth genomic study describing the pre-clinical response of hippocampal neurons to early prion replication. Our findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response that is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodelling. However, this response is terminated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms in the infected hippocampus, seemingly pointing to a critical juncture in the disease. Manipulation of these early neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential inroad for treatment.","['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prion Diseases/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prions/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Protein accession', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein modifications']"
25788273,DICKKOPF-1 locates in the nucleus of human differentiated epithelial intestinal and mammary cells and regulates gene expression,"Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) insurgence and progression depend on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Dickkopf (DKK)-1 is an extracellular inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that also has undefined β-catenin-independent actions. Here we report for the first time that a proportion of DKK-1 locates within the nucleus of healthy small intestine and colon mucosa, and of CRC cells at specific chromatin sites of active transcription. Moreover, we show that DKK-1 regulates several cancer-related genes including the cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and Ral-binding protein 1-associated Eps domain-containing 2 (REPS2), which are involved in detoxification of chemotherapeutic agents. Nuclear DKK-1 expression is lost along CRC progression; however, it remains high in a subset (15%) of CRC patients (n = 699) and associates with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) after chemotherapy administration and overall survival (OS) [adjusted HR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-2.21; P = 0.002)]. Overexpression of ALDH1A1 and REPS2 associates with nuclear DKK-1 expression in tumors and correlates with decreased OS (P = 0.001 and 0.014) and PFS. In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel location of DKK-1 within the cell nucleus and support a role of nuclear DKK-1 as a predictive biomarker of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer.","['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Signal Transduction']","['Family name', 'Gene family report', 'SCOP family', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell cycle', 'nucleotide', 'Cell type accession', 'Color', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'MAT', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

The chondrocytes in the anlagen further differentiate by undergoing a complex sequence of maturation and hypertrophy, and are eventually replaced by mineralized bone. Regulation of the onset of chondrogenesis is incompletely understood, and would be informed by comprehensive analyses of in vivo gene expression.","['Animals', '*Chondrogenesis', '*Embryonic Development', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Limb Buds/*embryology', 'Organogenesis']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mitochondria', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Genetic organisation', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name']"
22797057,Comparison of normalized signal intensities of various miRNAs in the exsosomes isolated by Exoquick or ultracentrifugation,"Recent findings indicate that specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as those of the miR-17-92 cluster, may be responsible for regulating endothelial gene expression during tumor angiogenesis. Secreted miRNAs enclosed in exosomes also have an important role in cell-cell communication. To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells, we investigated the effect of exosomal miRNAs derived from leukemia cells (K562) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As K562 cells released the miR-17-92 cluster, especially miR-92a, into the extracellular environment, K562 cells, transfected with Cy3-labeled pre-miR-92a, were co-cultured with HUVECs. Cy3-miR-92a derived from K562 cells was detected in the cytoplasm of HUVECs, and the Cy3-miR-92a co-localized with the signals of an exosomal marker, CD63. The expression of integrin α5, a target gene for miR-92a, was significantly reduced in HUVECs by exosomal miR-92a, indicating that exogenous miRNA via exosomal transport can function like endogenous miRNA in HUVECs. The most salient feature of this study is the exosome, derived from K562 cells with enforced miR-92a expression, did not affect the growth of HUVECs but did enhance endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our results support the idea that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in neoplasia-to-endothelial cell communication.","['Biological Transport', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha5/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Tetraspanin 30/genetics']","['Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Helical net', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Multiomics', 'Integrated gene prediction', 'Ion counting', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Pathology', 'Forcefield parameterisation', 'Cardiology', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA']"

DNA modification studies in circulating DNA (cirDNA) may lead to the development of specific non-invasive biomarkers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated cirDNA modifications in prostate cancer patients with locally confined disease (n = 19), in patients with benign prostate hyperplasias (n = 20) and in men without any known prostate disease (n = 20). This initial discovery screen identified 39 disease-associated changes in cirDNA modification, and seven of these were validated using the sodium bisulfite-based mapping of modified cytosines in both the discovery cohort and an independent 38-patient validation cohort. In particular, we showed that the DNA modification of regions adjacent to the gene encoding ring finger protein 219 distinguished prostate cancer from benign hyperplasias with good sensitivity (61%) and specificity (71%). We also showed that repetitive sequences detected in this study were meaningful, as they indicated a highly statistically significant loss of DNA at the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10 in prostate cancer patients (p = 1.8 × 10(-6)). Based on these strong univariate results, we applied machine-learning techniques to develop a multi-locus biomarker that correctly distinguished prostate cancer samples from unaffected controls with 72% accuracy. Lastly, we used systems biology techniques to integrate our data with publicly available DNA modification and transcriptomic data from primary prostate tumors, thereby prioritizing genes for further studies. These data suggest that cirDNA epigenomics are promising source for non-invasive biomarkers.","['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Centromere', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Cytosine/chemistry', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Circular/*blood', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'RNA central ID', 'Concentration', 'Phylogenetic inference (data centric)', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Cytometry', 'Cytoband position', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'DNA', 'dna', 'CD spectra', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Sequence position specification']"

In prostate cancer, increased activity of cell cycle genes has been associated with prognostic parameters such as biochemical relapse and survival. The identification of novel oncogenic and druggable targets in patient subgroups with poor prognosis may help to develop targeted therapy approaches. We analyzed prostate cancer and corresponding benign tissues (n = 98) using microarrays. The comparison of high- and low-grade tumors (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 vs. ≤ 3 + 4) revealed 144 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05). Out of these, 15 genes were involved in the cell cycle process. The gene maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) was identified to be highly correlated with cell cycle genes like UBE2C, TOP2A, CCNB2, and AURKB. Increased MELK gene expression in high-risk prostate cancer was validated by qPCR in an independent patient cohort (p < 0.005, n = 79). Immunohistochemistry analysis using a tissue microarray (n = 94) revealed increased MELK protein expression in prostate cancer tissues of high Gleason scores. RNAi-based inhibition of MELK in PC3 and LNCaP cells suggested putative function in chromatin modification, embryonic development and cell migration. The concerted inhibition of MELK and other cell cycle targets by the antibiotic siomycin A strongly impaired cell viability of prostate cancer cells, and may point to a novel therapy approach for a subset of high-risk prostate cancer patients.","['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Up-Regulation']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Protein variants', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Regulatory RNA']"
22145027,Conserved and divergent roles of Bcr1 and CFEM proteins in Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans,"Candida parapsilosis is a pathogenic fungus that is major cause of hospital-acquired infection, predominantly due to growth as biofilms on indwelling medical devices. It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","['Animals', 'Biofilms/*growth & development', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Candida/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/*genetics/*microbiology/pathology', 'Fungal Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'IDAT', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Operon', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"
23267561,Gene expression profiling reveals mast cell-dependent inflammation in the meninges in early EAE.,"The meninges are often considered inert tissues that house the CSF and provide protection for the brain and spinal cord. Yet emerging data demonstrates that they are also active sites of immune responses. Furthermore, the blood-CSF barrier surrounding meningeal blood vessels, together with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is postulated to serve as a gateway for the pathological infiltration of immune cells into the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous studies using mast cell-deficient (Kit(W/Wv)) mice demonstrated that mast cells resident in the dura mater and pia mater exacerbate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS, by facilitating CNS inflammatory cell influx. Here we examined the underlying mechanisms that mediate these effects. We demonstrate that there are dramatic alterations in immune associated gene expression in the meninges in pre-clinical disease, including those associated with mast cell and neutrophil function. Meningeal mast cells are activated within 24 h of disease induction, but do not directly compromise CNS vascular integrity. Rather, through production of TNF, mast cells elicit an early influx of neutrophils, cells known to alter vascular permeability, into the meninges. These data add to the growing evidence that inflammation in the meninges precedes CNS immune cell infiltration and establish that mast cells are among the earliest participants in these disease-initiating events. We hypothesize that mast cell-dependent neutrophil recruitment and activation in the meninges promotes early breakdown of the local BBB and CSF-blood barrier allowing initial immune cell access to the CNS.","['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Meninges/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain identifier', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration track image', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'cel', 'rast', 'CellML', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Mutation ID', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Sequence alignment', 'Multiple structure alignment', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Tumor annotation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

We immunized macaques with a DNA prime followed by SIV gp120 protein immunization with ALVAC-SIV and gp120 in alum, and we challenged them with SIV(mac251) at either a single high dose or at two repeated low-dose exposures to a 10-fold-lower dose. Infection was neither prevented nor modified following a single high-dose challenge of the immunized macaques. However, two exposures to a 10-fold-lower dose resulted in protection from SIV(mac251) acquisition in 3 out of 12 macaques.

17356868,Trifolium repens Map,"Allotetraploid white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a cool-season perennial legume used extensively as forage for livestock, is an important target for marker-assisted breeding. A genetic linkage map of white clover was constructed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers based on sequences from several Trifolieae species, including white clover, red clover (T. pratense L.), Medicago truncatula (Gaertn.) and soybean (Glycine max L.). An F(1) population consisting of 179 individuals, from a cross between two highly heterozygous genotypes, GA43 and Southern Regional Virus Resistant, was used for genetic mapping. A total of 1,571 SSR markers were screened for amplification and polymorphism using DNA from two parents and 14 F(1)s of the mapping population. The map consists of 415 loci amplified from 343 SSR primer pairs, including 83 from white clover, 181 from red clover, 77 from M. truncatula, and two from soybean. Linkage groups for all eight homoeologous chromosome pairs of allotetraploid white clover were detected. Map length was estimated at 1,877 cM with 87% genome coverage. Map density was approximately 5 cM per locus. Segregation distortion was detected in six segments of the genome (homoeologous groups A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and D1). A comparison of map locations of markers originating from white clover, red clover, and alfalfa (M. sativa L.) revealed putative macro-colinearity between the three Trifolieae species. This map can be used to link quantitative trait loci with SSR markers, and accelerate the improvement of white clover by marker-assisted selection and breeding.","['*Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genome, Plant', 'Medicago sativa/genetics', 'Medicago truncatula/genetics', '*Minisatellite Repeats', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity', 'Trifolium/*genetics']","['Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome name', 'Chromosome report', 'Primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'PCR primers', 'Genetic linkage report', 'Genetic mapping and linkage', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Biomarkers', 'Plant biology', 'Genome map', 'Genome alignment', 'Gene ID (MIPS Medicago)', 'Medical informatics', 'Medicine', 'Microsatellites', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"
23297224,Daily cycling of genome-wide histone methylation,"Daily cyclical expression of thousands of genes in tissues such as the liver is orchestrated by the molecular circadian clock, the disruption of which is implicated in metabolic disorders and cancer. Although we understand much about the circadian transcription factors that can switch gene expression on and off, it is still unclear how global changes in rhythmic transcription are controlled at the genomic level. Here, we demonstrate circadian modification of an activating histone mark at a significant proportion of gene loci that undergo daily transcription, implicating widespread epigenetic modification as a key node regulated by the clockwork. Furthermore, we identify the histone-remodelling enzyme mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)3 as a clock-controlled factor that is able to directly and indirectly modulate over a hundred epigenetically targeted circadian ""output"" genes in the liver. Importantly, catalytic inactivation of the histone methyltransferase activity of MLL3 also severely compromises the oscillation of ""core"" clock gene promoters, including Bmal1, mCry1, mPer2, and Rev-erbα, suggesting that rhythmic histone methylation is vital for robust transcriptional oscillator function. This highlights a pathway by which the clockwork exerts genome-wide control over transcription, which is critical for sustaining temporal programming of tissue physiology.","['ARNTL Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Circadian Rhythm/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cryptochromes/deficiency/genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1/genetics', 'Period Circadian Proteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Systems Biology', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Systems biology', 'Biology', 'Biological system modelling', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
23435417,Gene regulation following MIF / IL-8 stimulation,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and bone marrow. The main feature of the disease is accumulation of the malignant cells due to decreased apoptosis. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activating molecule family of immunoreceptors, and has an unknown function in CLL cells. Here, we show that the expression of CD84 is significantly elevated from the early stages of the disease, and is regulated by macrophage migration inhibitory factor and its receptor, CD74. Activation of cell surface CD84 initiates a signaling cascade that enhances CLL cell survival. Both downmodulation of CD84 expression and its immune-mediated blockade induce cell death in vitro and in vivo. In addition, analysis of samples derived from an on-going clinical trial, in which human subjects were treated with humanized anti-CD74 (milatuzumab), shows a decrease in CD84 messenger RNA and protein levels in milatuzumab-treated cells. This downregulation was correlated with reduction of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression. Thus, our data show that overexpression of CD84 in CLL is an important survival mechanism that appears to be an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the blockade of this CD84-dependent survival pathway.","['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family']","['Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'CD spectra', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'CATH class', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Molecule accession', 'Protein family signature', 'Molecule name']"
22882838,Identification of a complex genetic network involved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae colony morphology,"When grown on solid substrates, different microorganisms often form colonies with very specific morphologies. Whereas the pioneers of microbiology often used colony morphology to discriminate between species and strains, the phenomenon has not received much attention recently. In this study, we use a genome-wide assay in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify all genes that affect colony morphology. We show that several major signalling cascades, including the MAPK, TORC, SNF1 and RIM101 pathways play a role, indicating that morphological changes are a reaction to changing environments. Other genes that affect colony morphology are involved in protein sorting and epigenetic regulation. Interestingly, the screen reveals only few genes that are likely to play a direct role in establishing colony morphology, with one notable example being FLO11, a gene encoding a cell-surface adhesin that has already been implicated in colony morphology, biofilm formation, and invasive and pseudohyphal growth. Using a series of modified promoters for fine-tuning FLO11 expression, we confirm the central role of Flo11 and show that differences in FLO11 expression result in distinct colony morphologies. Together, our results provide a first comprehensive look at the complex genetic network that underlies the diversity in the morphologies of yeast colonies.","['*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/*growth & development', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological']","['Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"
23075850,Progressive degeneration of human neural stem cells caused by pathogenic LRRK2,"Nuclear-architecture defects have been shown to correlate with the manifestation of a number of human diseases as well as ageing. It is therefore plausible that diseases whose manifestations correlate with ageing might be connected to the appearance of nuclear aberrations over time. We decided to evaluate nuclear organization in the context of ageing-associated disorders by focusing on a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) dominant mutation (G2019S; glycine-to-serine substitution at amino acid 2019), which is associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease as well as impairment of adult neurogenesis in mice. Here we report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Parkinson's disease patients and the implications of LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human neural-stem-cell (NSC) populations. Mutant NSCs showed increased susceptibility to proteasomal stress as well as passage-dependent deficiencies in nuclear-envelope organization, clonal expansion and neuronal differentiation. Disease phenotypes were rescued by targeted correction of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation with its wild-type counterpart in Parkinson's disease iPSCs and were recapitulated after targeted knock-in of the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation in human embryonic stem cells. Analysis of human brain tissue showed nuclear-envelope impairment in clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients. Together, our results identify the nucleus as a previously unknown cellular organelle in Parkinson's disease pathology and may help to open new avenues for Parkinson's disease diagnoses as well as for the potential development of therapeutics targeting this fundamental cell structure.","['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Envelope/genetics/pathology', 'Parkinson Disease/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Clone ID', 'Clone library', 'Clone ID (IMAGE)', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Protein repeat signature', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Structural data', 'NeuroML', 'MRI', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"

In this study we used the Affymetrix Canine Array to determine differential expression of potential target genes during the progression to decompensation. Cardiac RNA was extracted at control, 3 and 4 weeks of pacing (n=4).","Our aim was to determine the changes in the gene expression profile occurring during the transition from compensated dysfunction (CD) to decompensated heart failure (HF) in pacing-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. Twelve chronically instrumented dogs underwent left ventricular pacing at 210 beats/min for 3 wk and at 240 beats thereafter, and four normal dogs were used as control. The transition from CD to HF occurred between the 3rd and 4th wk of pacing, with end-stage HF at 28 +/- 1 days. RNA was extracted from left ventricular tissue at control and 3 and 4 wk of pacing (n = 4) and tested with the Affymetrix Canine Array. We found 509 genes differentially expressed in CD vs. control (P < or = 0.05, fold change > or = +/-2), with 362 increasing and 147 decreasing; 526 genes were differentially expressed in HF vs. control (P < or = 0.05; fold change > or = +/-2), with 439 increasing and 87 decreasing. To better understand the transition, we compared gene alterations at 3 vs. 4 wk pacing and found that only 30 genes differed (P < or = 0.05; fold change of +/-2). We conclude that a number of processes including normalization of gene regulation during decompensation, appearance of new upregulated genes and maintenance of gene expression all contribute to the transition to overt heart failure with an unexpectedly small number of genes differentially regulated.","['Animals', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'Cardiac Pacing, Artificial/veterinary', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/complications/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Dog Diseases/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heart Failure/etiology/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Heart Rate/genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/veterinary', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'Cardiology', 'Protein hydropathy calculation', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Date', 'Heat map generation', 'Rate of association', 'MAT', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"

This report seeks to identify the specific aspects of positive psychological well-being that oppose such effects and predict reduced CTRA gene expression. In a new confirmation study of 122 healthy adults that replicated the approach of a previously reported discovery study, mixed effect linear model analyses identified a significant inverse association between expression of CTRA indicator genes and a summary measure of eudaimonic well-being from the Mental Health Continuum - Short Form. Analyses of a 2- representation of eudaimonia converged in finding correlated psychological and social subdomains of eudaimonic well-being to be the primary carriers of CTRA associations. Hedonic well-being showed no consistent CTRA association independent of eudaimonic well-being, and summary measures integrating hedonic and eudaimonic well-being showed less stable CTRA associations than did focal measures of eudaimonia (psychological and social well-being). Similar results emerged from analyses of pooled discovery and confirmation samples (n = 198). Similar results also emerged from analyses of a second new generalization study of 107 healthy adults that included the more detailed Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being and found this more robust measure of eudaimonic well-being to also associate with reduced CTRA gene expression. Five of the 6 major sub-domains of psychological well-being predicted reduced CTRA gene expression when analyzed separately, and 3 remained distinctively prognostic in mutually adjusted analyses. All associations were independent of demographic characteristics, health-related confounders, and RNA indicators of leukocyte subset distribution.

CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from an age-matched healthy donor were also reprogrammed. We captured a part of the genetic heterogeneity observed in the patient, i.e. we analyzed five clones with two genetic backgrounds, without and with the <i>KRAS</i>(G12D) mutation. Hematopoietic differentiation of these clones recapitulated the main features of the patient's disease, including overproduction of granulomonocytes and dysmegakaryopoiesis.

The gut microbiota produces a myriad of metabolites that affect host physiology and susceptibility to disease; however, the underlying molecular events remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that microbial colonization regulates global histone acetylation and methylation in multiple host tissues in a diet-dependent manner: consumption of a ""Western-type"" diet prevents many of the microbiota-dependent chromatin changes that occur in a polysaccharide-rich diet. Finally, we demonstrate that supplementation of germ-free mice with short-chain fatty acids, major products of gut bacterial fermentation, is sufficient to recapitulate chromatin modification states and transcriptional responses associated with colonization. These findings have profound implications for understanding the complex functional interactions between diet, gut microbiota, and host health.","['Adipose Tissue/enzymology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Colon/enzymology/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Diet, Western', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile/*metabolism', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*physiology', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Specificity']","['Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Color', 'Ecology', 'Data acquisition', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Exome sequencing', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Nucleic acids', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Histogram', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification']"
27184390,The Tip60/NuA4 complex is required for proper cell cycle progression and the transition to a post-mitotic state in Drosophila melanogaster,"Robust and synchronous repression of E2F-dependent gene expression is critical to the proper timing of cell cycle exit when cells transition to a postmitotic state. Previously NuA4 was suggested to act as a barrier to proliferation in Drosophila by repressing E2F-dependent gene expression. Here we show that NuA4 activity is required for proper cell cycle exit and the repression of cell cycle genes during the transition to a postmitotic state in vivo However, the delay of cell cycle exit caused by compromising NuA4 is not due to additional proliferation or effects on E2F activity. Instead NuA4 inhibition results in slowed cell cycle progression through late S and G2 phases due to aberrant activation of an intrinsic p53-independent DNA damage response. A reduction in NuA4 function ultimately produces a paradoxical cell cycle gene expression program, where certain cell cycle genes become derepressed in cells that are delayed during the G2 phase of the final cell cycle. Bypassing the G2 delay when NuA4 is inhibited leads to abnormal mitoses and results in severe tissue defects. NuA4 physically and genetically interacts with components of the E2F complex termed D: rosophila, R: bf, E: 2F A: nd M: yb/ M: ulti-vulva class B: (DREAM/MMB), and modulates a DREAM/MMB-dependent ectopic neuron phenotype in the posterior wing margin. However, this effect is also likely due to the cell cycle delay, as simply reducing Cdk1 is sufficient to generate a similar phenotype. Our work reveals that the major requirement for NuA4 in the cell cycle in vivo is to suppress an endogenous DNA damage response, which is required to coordinate proper S and G2 cell cycle progression with differentiation and cell cycle gene expression.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics/growth & development', 'G2 Phase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Histone Code/genetics', 'Histones/genetics', 'Mitosis/genetics', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*genetics', 'Wings, Animal/growth & development/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Protein domains', 'Phasing', 'Translation phase specification', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene ID', 'CATH node ID', 'Genetic code', 'Histogram', 'Mitochondria', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment']"

28684431,Convergent roles of ATF3 and CSL in chromatin control of CAF activation [HistoneMarkers ChIPseq],"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important for tumor initiation and promotion. CSL, a transcriptional repressor and Notch mediator, suppresses CAF activation. Like CSL, ATF3, a stress-responsive transcriptional repressor, is down-modulated in skin cancer stromal cells, and <i>Atf3</i> knockout mice develop aggressive chemically induced skin tumors with enhanced CAF activation. Even at low basal levels, ATF3 converges with CSL in global chromatin control, binding to few genomic sites at a large distance from target genes. Consistent with this mode of regulation, deletion of one such site 2 Mb upstream of <i>IL6</i> induces expression of the gene. Observed changes are of translational significance, as bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors, unlinking activated chromatin from basic transcription, counteract the effects of ATF3 or CSL loss on global gene expression and suppress CAF tumor-promoting properties in an in vivo model of squamous cancer-stromal cell expansion. Thus, ATF3 converges with CSL in negative control of CAF activation with epigenetic changes amenable to cancer- and stroma-focused intervention.","['Activating Transcription Factor 3/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/physiopathology', 'Chromatin/*physiology', 'Keratinocytes/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Muscle Proteins/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/physiopathology']","['Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Cancer type', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'chrominfo', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"

We show that loss of function of Nkx3.1 in mouse prostate results in down-regulation of genes that are essential for prostate differentiation, as well as up-regulation of genes that are not normally expressed in prostate. Conversely, gain of function of Nkx3.1 in an otherwise fully differentiated nonprostatic mouse epithelium (seminal vesicle) is sufficient for respecification to prostate in renal grafts in vivo. In human prostate cells, these activities require the interaction of NKX3.1 with the G9a histone methyltransferase via the homeodomain and are mediated by activation of target genes such as UTY (KDM6c), the male-specific paralog of UTX (KDM6a) We propose that an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY transcriptional regulatory network is essential for prostate differentiation, and we speculate that disruption of such a network predisposes to prostate cancer.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Prostate', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Laboratory techniques', 'R markdown', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Statistics and probability', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Prosite accession number', 'Date', 'Prosite protein pattern', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
23104808,Identification of the Bacteroides fragilis EcfO regulon 2,"The anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis is a highly aerotolerant, opportunistic pathogen that is an important component of the human intestinal microbiota. Aerotolerance has been linked to a robust oxidative stress response, which in turn is necessary for maximal virulence in a mouse intra-abdominal abscess model. During oxidative stress, there is a dynamic change in gene expression that encompasses a third of the genome, but there is a paucity of information on factors that control this response. A large number of transcription regulators, including about 14 extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, are affected by oxidative stress, and one of these, EcfO, was used as a model of ECF sigma factor activity during stress. Genetic and biochemical experiments showed that EcfO was located in an operon with a structurally unique anti-sigma factor, Reo. Cells deleted for EcfO were impaired during exposure to oxygen or other forms of oxidative stress, whereas reo mutants were more resistant to stress. Protein-protein interaction experiments demonstrated that Reo directly interacts with and regulates the activity of EcfO. Expression microarray and chromatin affinity precipitation assays were used to identify target genes regulated by EcfO, and an EcfO recognition sequence was identified. The results revealed that EcfO controls a regulon of novel lipoproteins whose distribution in nature is restricted to members of the Bacteroidetes phylum.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bacteroides fragilis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Sigma Factor/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Plasmid map drawing', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
22411629,The General Transcription Factor TAF7 is Essential for Embryonic Development but Not Essential for the Survival or Differentiation of Mature T Cells (MEF data),"TAF7, a component of the TFIID complex that nucleates the assembly of transcription preinitiation complexes, also independently interacts with and regulates the enzymatic activities of other transcription factors, including P-TEFb, TFIIH, and CIITA, ensuring an orderly progression in transcription initiation. Since not all TAFs are required in terminally differentiated cells, we examined the essentiality of TAF7 in cells at different developmental stages in vivo. Germ line disruption of the TAF7 gene is embryonic lethal between 3.5 and 5.5 days postcoitus. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts with TAF7 deleted cease transcription globally and stop proliferating. In contrast, whereas TAF7 is essential for the differentiation and proliferation of immature thymocytes, it is not required for subsequent, proliferation-independent differentiation of lineage committed thymocytes or for their egress into the periphery. TAF7 deletion in peripheral CD4 T cells affects only a small number of transcripts. However, T cells with TAF7 deleted are not able to undergo activation and expansion in response to antigenic stimuli. These findings suggest that TAF7 is essential for proliferation but not for proliferation-independent differentiation.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor TFIID/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
22696308,Expression profiling shows differential functions and provides potential new diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal serrated adenocarcinoma,"Serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC) is a recently recognized colorectal cancer (CRC) subtype accounting for 7.5 to 8.7% of CRCs. It has been shown that SAC has a poorer prognosis and has different molecular and immunohistochemical features compared with conventional carcinoma (CC) but, to date, only one previous study has analyzed its mRNA expression profile by microarray. Using a different microarray platform, we have studied the molecular signature of 11 SACs and compared it with that of 15 matched CC with the aim of discerning the functions which characterize SAC biology and validating, at the mRNA and protein level, the most differentially expressed genes which were also tested using a validation set of 70 SACs and 70 CCs to assess their diagnostic and prognostic values. Microarray data showed a higher representation of morphogenesis-, hypoxia-, cytoskeleton- and vesicle transport-related functions and also an overexpression of fascin1 (actin-bundling protein associated with invasion) and the antiapoptotic gene hippocalcin in SAC all of which were validated both by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. Fascin1 expression was statistically associated with KRAS mutation with 88.6% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for SAC diagnosis and the positivity of fascin1 or hippocalcin was highly suggestive of SAC diagnosis (sensitivity = 100%). Evaluation of these markers in CRCs showing histological and molecular characteristics of high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) also helped to distinguish SACs from MSI-H CRCs. Molecular profiling demonstrates that SAC shows activation of distinct signaling pathways and that immunohistochemical fascin1 and hippocalcin expression can be reliably used for its differentiation from other CRC subtypes.","['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hippocalcin/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuronal Apoptosis-Inhibitory Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogenes', '*Transcriptome']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Color', 'DNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein alignment', 'Microsatellites', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Protein crystallizability', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

We describe the circulating leukocyte transcriptome after severe trauma and burn injury, as well as in healthy subjects receiving low-dose bacterial endotoxin, and show that these severe stresses produce a global reprioritization affecting >80% of the cellular functions and pathways, a truly unexpected ""genomic storm."" In severe blunt trauma, the early leukocyte genomic response is consistent with simultaneously increased expression of genes involved in the systemic inflammatory, innate immune, and compensatory antiinflammatory responses, as well as in the suppression of genes involved in adaptive immunity. Furthermore, complications like nosocomial infections and organ failure are not associated with any genomic evidence of a second hit and differ only in the magnitude and duration of this genomic reprioritization. The similarities in gene expression patterns between different injuries reveal an apparently fundamental human response to severe inflammatory stress, with genomic signatures that are surprisingly far more common than different.

We identified three promoters with strong negative regulation by PfmR, both in vivo and in vitro. PfmR binds pseudopalindromic sequences, with the consensus sequence of 5'-TACCGACCGNTNGGTN-3' surrounding the promoters. According to the amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure analyses of the PfmR-regulated gene products, they are predicted to be involved in phenylacetic acid and fatty acid metabolism. In vitro analyses revealed that PfmR weakly cross-regulated with the TetR family repressor T. thermophilus PaaR, which controls the expression of the paa gene cluster putatively involved in phenylacetic acid degradation but not with another functionally identified TetR family repressor, T. thermophilus FadR, which is involved in fatty acid degradation. The X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of PfmR and the nucleotide sequence of the predicted PfmR-binding site are quite similar to those of the TetR family repressor QacR from Staphylococcus aureus. Similar to QacR, two PfmR dimers bound per target DNA. The bases recognized by QacR within the QacR-binding site are conserved in the predicted PfmR-binding site, and they were important for PfmR to recognize the binding site and properly assemble on it. The center of the PfmR molecule contains a tunnel-like pocket, which may be the ligand-binding site of this regulator.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thermus thermophilus/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database name', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Sequence data', 'Protein secondary structure', 'Protein secondary structure comparison', 'Protein report', 'Sequence alignment', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Thermo RAW', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamics', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamic data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway. Here, we report that selective deletion of Ubc9 within the Treg lineage results in fatal early-onset autoimmunity similar to Foxp3 mutant mice. Ubc9-deficient Treg cells exhibit severe defects in TCR-driven homeostatic proliferation, accompanied by impaired activation and compromised suppressor function.

21507986,Enterobacteria phage AR1,"We report the genome organization and analysis of the first completely sequenced T4-like phage, AR1, of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Unlike most of the other sequenced phages of O157:H7, which belong to the temperate Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families, AR1 is a T4-like phage known to efficiently infect this pathogenic bacterial strain. The 167,435-bp AR1 genome is currently the largest among all the sequenced E. coli O157:H7 phages. It carries a total of 281 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and 10 putative tRNA genes. Of these, 126 predicted proteins could be classified into six viral orthologous group categories, with at least 18 proteins of the structural protein category having been detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Comparative genomic analysis of AR1 and four other completely sequenced T4-like genomes (RB32, RB69, T4, and JS98) indicated that they share a well-organized and highly conserved core genome, particularly in the regions encoding DNA replication and virion structural proteins. The major diverse features between these phages include the modules of distal tail fibers and the types and numbers of internal proteins, tRNA genes, and mobile elements. Codon usage analysis suggested that the presence of AR1-encoded tRNAs may be relevant to the codon usage of structural proteins. Furthermore, protein sequence analysis of AR1 gp37, a potential receptor binding protein, indicated that eight residues in the C terminus are unique to O157:H7 T4-like phages AR1 and PP01.

Defining TEAD transcription factor function in myogenesis has proved elusive due to overlapping expression of family members and their functional redundancy. We show that silencing of either Tead1, Tead2 or Tead4 did not effect primary myoblast (PM) differentiation, but that their simultaneous knockdown strongly impaired differentiation. In contrast, Tead1 or Tead4 silencing impaired C2C12 differentiation showing their different contributions in PMs and C2C12 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified enhancers associated with myogenic genes bound by combinations of Tead4, Myod1 or Myog. Tead4 regulated distinct gene sets in C2C12 cells and PMs involving both activation of the myogenic program and repression of growth and signaling pathways. ChIP-seq from mature mouse muscle fibres in vivo identified a set of highly transcribed muscle cell-identity genes and sites bound by Tead1 and Tead4. Although inactivation of Tead4 in mature muscle fibres caused no obvious phenotype under normal conditions, notexin-induced muscle regeneration was delayed in Tead4 mutants suggesting an important role in myogenic differentiation in vivo. By combining knockdown in cell models in vitro with Tead4 inactivation in muscle in vivo, we provide the first comprehensive description of the specific and redundant roles of Tead factors in myogenic differentiation.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Muscle Development/genetics', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Muscles/cytology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myoblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Regeneration/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Plotting', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Light microscopy', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'SMILES', ""Ensembl ID ('Mus musculus')"", 'Molecules', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Reverse complement', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
25754082,Gene Networks Specific for Innate Immunity Define Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [Affymetrix],"The molecular factors involved in the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remain poorly understood. Previous transcriptomic studies investigating the mechanisms of PTSD apply targeted approaches to identify individual genes under a cross-sectional framework lack a holistic view of the behaviours and properties of these genes at the system-level. Here we sought to apply an unsupervised gene-network based approach to a prospective experimental design using whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq gene expression from peripheral blood leukocytes of U.S. Marines (N=188), obtained both pre- and post-deployment to conflict zones. We identified discrete groups of co-regulated genes (i.e., co-expression modules) and tested them for association to PTSD. We identified one module at both pre- and post-deployment containing putative causal signatures for PTSD development displaying an over-expression of genes enriched for functions of innate-immune response and interferon signalling (Type-I and Type-II). Importantly, these results were replicated in a second non-overlapping independent dataset of U.S. Marines (N=96), further outlining the role of innate immune and interferon signalling genes within co-expression modules to explain at least part of the causal pathophysiology for PTSD development. A second module, consequential of trauma exposure, contained PTSD resiliency signatures and an over-expression of genes involved in hemostasis and wound responsiveness suggesting that chronic levels of stress impair proper wound healing during/after exposure to the battlefield while highlighting the role of the hemostatic system as a clinical indicator of chronic-based stress. These findings provide novel insights for early preventative measures and advanced PTSD detection, which may lead to interventions that delay or perhaps abrogate the development of PTSD.","['Gene Expression', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Young Adult']","['Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'MAT', 'Person name', 'Person identifier', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Trauma medicine']"
29997230,"Altered Cell-Cycle Control, Inflammation and Adhesion in High-Risk Persistent Bronchial Dysplasia","Persistent bronchial dysplasia is associated with increased risk of developing invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. In this study, we hypothesized that differences in gene expression profiles between persistent and regressive bronchial dysplasia would identify cellular processes that underlie progression to SCC. RNA expression arrays comparing baseline biopsies from 32 bronchial sites that persisted/progressed to 31 regressive sites showed 395 differentially expressed genes [ANOVA, FDR ≤ 0.05). Thirty-one pathways showed significantly altered activity between the two groups, many of which were associated with cell-cycle control and proliferation, inflammation, or epithelial differentiation/cell-cell adhesion. Cultured persistent bronchial dysplasia cells exhibited increased expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which was associated with multiple cell-cycle pathways. Treatment with PLK1 inhibitor induced apoptosis and G<sub>2</sub>-M arrest and decreased proliferation compared with untreated cells; these effects were not seen in normal or regressive bronchial dysplasia cultures. Inflammatory pathway activity was decreased in persistent bronchial dysplasia, and the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate was more common in regressive bronchial dysplasia. Regressive bronchial dysplasia was also associated with trends toward overall increases in macrophages and T lymphocytes and altered polarization of these inflammatory cell subsets. Increased desmoglein 3 and plakoglobin expression was associated with higher grade and persistence of bronchial dysplasia. These results identify alterations in the persistent subset of bronchial dysplasia that are associated with high risk for progression to invasive SCC. These alterations may serve as strong markers of risk and as effective targets for lung cancer prevention.<b>Significance:</b> Gene expression profiling of high-risk persistent bronchial dysplasia reveals changes in cell-cycle control, inflammatory activity, and epithelial differentiation/cell-cell adhesion that may underlie progression to invasive SCC. <i>Cancer Res; 78(17); 4971-83. ©2018 AACR</i>.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bronchi/metabolism/pathology', 'Bronchial Diseases/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Desmoglein 3/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaplasia', 'Middle Aged', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'gamma Catenin/genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'BioPAX', 'Biophysics', 'BioPax term', 'InChI', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Cell cycle', 'Psiblast checkpoint file', 'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Protein design', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'MAT', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Cancer type', 'affymetrix-exp', 'Protein threading', 'Protein databases', 'Protein data', 'Gamma diversity data']"

The signals regulating ILC3-T cell responses remain unknown. Here, we show that transcripts associated with MHC II antigen presentation are down-modulated in intestinal natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)<sup>-</sup> ILC3s. Further data implicate microbiota-induced IL-23 as a crucial signal for reversible silencing of MHC II in ILC3s, thereby reducing the capacity of ILC3s to present antigen to T cells in the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, IL-23-mediated MHC II suppression is dependent on mTORC1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in NCR<sup>-</sup> ILC3s. By contrast, splenic interferon-γ induces MHC II expression and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulation by NCR<sup>-</sup> ILC3s.

Using neural induction from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a paradigm, we interrogated these dynamics by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) at seven time points during early neural differentiation. We found that changes in DNA accessibility precede H3K27ac, which is followed by gene expression changes. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to test the activity of 2,464 candidate regulatory sequences at all seven time points, we show that many of these sequences have temporal activity patterns that correlate with their respective cell-endogenous gene expression and chromatin changes. A prioritization method incorporating all genomic and MPRA data further identified key transcription factors involved in driving neural fate.

However, the reliance on gene expression correlations rather than mechanistic insight has shown limited potential and suggests a critical need for molecular network models that better predict neuroblastoma progression. In this study, we construct and simulate a molecular network of developmental genes and downstream signals in a 6-gene input logic model that predicts a favorable/unfavorable outcome based on the outcome of the four cell states including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. We simulate the mis-expression of the tyrosine receptor kinases, trkA and trkB, two prognostic indicators of neuroblastoma, and find differences in the number and probability distribution of steady state outcomes. We validate the mechanistic model assumptions using RNAseq of the SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line to define the input states and confirm the predicted outcome with antibody staining. Lastly, we apply input gene signatures from 77 published human patient samples and show that our model makes more accurate disease outcome predictions for early stage disease than any current neuroblastoma gene list. These findings highlight the predictive strength of a logic-based model based on developmental genes and offer a better understanding of the molecular network interactions during neuroblastoma disease progression.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Logic', '*Models, Biological', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Logical operator', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Ecological data', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Neurobiology', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology']"

25319996,Divergent functions of hematopoietic transcription factors in lineage priming and differentiation during erythro-megakaryopoiesis,"Combinatorial actions of relatively few transcription factors control hematopoietic differentiation. To investigate this process in erythro-megakaryopoiesis, we correlated the genome-wide chromatin occupancy signatures of four master hematopoietic transcription factors (GATA1, GATA2, TAL1, and FLI1) and three diagnostic histone modification marks with the gene expression changes that occur during development of primary cultured megakaryocytes (MEG) and primary erythroblasts (ERY) from murine fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We identified a robust, genome-wide mechanism of MEG-specific lineage priming by a previously described stem/progenitor cell-expressed transcription factor heptad (GATA2, LYL1, TAL1, FLI1, ERG, RUNX1, LMO2) binding to MEG-associated cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in multipotential progenitors. This is followed by genome-wide GATA factor switching that mediates further induction of MEG-specific genes following lineage commitment. Interaction between GATA and ETS factors appears to be a key determinant of these processes. In contrast, ERY-specific lineage priming is biased toward GATA2-independent mechanisms. In addition to its role in MEG lineage priming, GATA2 plays an extensive role in late megakaryopoiesis as a transcriptional repressor at loci defined by a specific DNA signature. Our findings reveal important new insights into how ERY and MEG lineages arise from a common bipotential progenitor via overlapping and divergent functions of shared hematopoietic transcription factors.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome assembly', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Histogram', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription']"

To characterize all of the missing proteins, we applied an OMICS-integrated analysis of three human liver cell lines (Hep3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3) using mRNA and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNA deep sequencing and proteome profiling, contributing mass spectrometric evidence of 60 additional chromosome 1 gene products. Integration of the annotation information from public databases revealed that 84.6% of genes on chromosome 1 had high-confidence protein evidence. Hierarchical analysis demonstrated that the remaining 320 missing genes were either experimentally or biologically explainable; 128 genes were found to be tissue-specific or rarely expressed in some tissues, whereas 91 proteins were uncharacterized mainly due to database annotation diversity, 89 were genes with low mRNA abundance or unsuitable protein properties, and 12 genes were identifiable theoretically because of a high abundance of mRNAs/RNC-mRNAs and the existence of proteotypic peptides. The relatively large contribution made by the identification of enriched transcription factors suggested specific enrichment of low-abundance protein classes, and SRM/MRM could capture high-priority missing proteins. Detailed analyses of the differentially expressed genes indicated that several gene families located on chromosome 1 may play critical roles in mediating hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and metastasis.

26170331,Genome-wide analysis of wild type and gemin2 mutant plants exposed to cold,"The mechanisms by which poikilothermic organisms ensure that biological processes are robust to temperature changes are largely unknown. Temperature compensation, the ability of circadian rhythms to maintain a relatively constant period over the broad range of temperatures resulting from seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, is a defining property of circadian networks. Temperature affects the alternative splicing (AS) of several clock genes in fungi, plants, and flies, but the splicing factors that modulate these effects to ensure clock accuracy throughout the year remain to be identified. Here we show that GEMIN2, a spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly factor conserved from yeast to humans, modulates low temperature effects on a large subset of pre-mRNA splicing events. In particular, GEMIN2 controls the AS of several clock genes and attenuates the effects of temperature on the circadian period in Arabidopsis thaliana. We conclude that GEMIN2 is a key component of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism that ensures the appropriate acclimation of plants to daily and seasonal changes in temperature conditions.","['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis/*genetics/physiology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Plant Leaves/physiology', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'SMN Complex Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spliceosomes/physiology', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA testing', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome assembly', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'Biobank', 'protein', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Splice sites', 'Splice site prediction', 'Ribosomes', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
31636187,The 1KITE project: evolution of insects,"Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the major superradiations of insects, comprising nearly 160,000 described extant species. As herbivores, pollinators, and prey, Lepidoptera play a fundamental role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Lepidoptera are also indicators of environmental change and serve as models for research on mimicry and genetics. They have been central to the development of coevolutionary hypotheses, such as butterflies with flowering plants and moths' evolutionary arms race with echolocating bats. However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested, because a robust lepidopteran phylogeny and timing of evolutionary novelties are lacking. To address these issues, we inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Lepidoptera, using the largest dataset assembled for the order (2,098 orthologous protein-coding genes from transcriptomes of 186 species, representing nearly all superfamilies), and dated it with carefully evaluated synapomorphy-based fossils. The oldest members of the Lepidoptera crown group appeared in the Late Carboniferous (∼300 Ma) and fed on nonvascular land plants. Lepidoptera evolved the tube-like proboscis in the Middle Triassic (∼241 Ma), which allowed them to acquire nectar from flowering plants. This morphological innovation, along with other traits, likely promoted the extraordinary diversification of superfamily-level lepidopteran crown groups. The ancestor of butterflies was likely nocturnal, and our results indicate that butterflies became day-flying in the Late Cretaceous (∼98 Ma). Moth hearing organs arose multiple times before the evolutionary arms race between moths and bats, perhaps initially detecting a wide range of sound frequencies before being co-opted to specifically detect bat sonar. Our study provides an essential framework for future comparative studies on butterfly and moth evolution.","['Animals', 'Butterflies/classification/*genetics/physiology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Moths/classification/*genetics/physiology', '*Phylogeny']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Flies', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Mathematics', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction']"
32899808,Bluetongue Virus serotype 25 GER2018 segment 1-10 complete CDS,"Recently, several so-called ""atypical"" Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes were discovered, including BTV-25 (Toggenburg virus), in Switzerland. Most ""atypical"" BTV were identified in small ruminants without clinical signs. In 2018, two goats from a holding in Germany tested positive for BTV-25 genome by RT-qPCR prior to export. After experimental inoculation of the two goats with the BTV-25 positive field blood samples for generation of reference materials, viremia could be observed in one animal. For the first time, the BTV-25-related virus was isolated in cell culture from EDTA-blood and the full genome of isolate ""BTV-25-GER2018"" could be generated. BTV-25-GER2018 was only incompletely neutralized by ELISA-positive sera. We could monitor the BTV-25 occurrence in the respective affected goat flock of approximately 120 goats over several years. EDTA blood samples were screened with RT-qPCR using a newly developed BTV-25 specific assay. For serological surveillance, serum samples were screened using a commercial cELISA. BTV-25-GER2018 was detected over 4.5 years in the goat flock with intermittent PCR-positivity in some animals, and with or without concomitantly detected antibodies since 2015. We could demonstrate the viral persistence of BTV-25-GER2018 in goats for up to 4.5 years, and the first BTV-25 isolate is now available for further characterization.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blood/virology', 'Bluetongue/blood/*virology', 'Bluetongue virus/classification/genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral', 'Goat Diseases/blood/*virology', 'Goats']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'BLC', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats']"
34452403,Enhanced Bat Lyssavirus Surveillance in Germany between 2018-2020,"Lyssaviruses are the causative agents for rabies, a zoonotic and fatal disease. Bats are the ancestral reservoir host for lyssaviruses, and at least three different lyssaviruses have been found in bats from Germany. Across Europe, novel lyssaviruses were identified in bats recently and occasional spillover infections in other mammals and human cases highlight their public health relevance. Here, we report the results from an enhanced passive bat rabies surveillance that encompasses samples without human contact that would not be tested under routine conditions. To this end, 1236 bat brain samples obtained between 2018 and 2020 were screened for lyssaviruses via several RT-qPCR assays. European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) was dominant, with 15 positives exclusively found in serotine bats (<i>Eptesicus serotinus</i>) from northern Germany. Additionally, when an archived set of bat samples that had tested negative for rabies by the FAT were screened in the process of assay validation, four samples tested EBLV-1 positive, including two detected in <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i>. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of 17 full genomes assigned all except one of these viruses to the A1 cluster of the EBLV-1a sub-lineage. Furthermore, we report here another Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) infection in a Natterer's bat (<i>Myotis nattereri</i>) found in Lower Saxony, the tenth reported case of this novel bat lyssavirus.","['Animals', 'Chiroptera/*virology', 'Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary/virology', 'Epidemiological Monitoring/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Lyssavirus/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Viral Zoonoses/epidemiology/transmission']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chimera detection', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease report', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Bioimaging', 'Plant biology', 'GermOnline ID', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'MAT', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA central ID', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum', 'Protein active sites', 'Infectious disease']"
23883479,"Transcriptional profiling of K562-r comparing control untreated human leukemia cells with human leukemia cells treated with AMN107 and ATO individually or combined.Four timepoints included are 3h,12h,24h,48h, covering the whole time window of K562-r cells responsing to the drug treatment.At the combination of 1.5uM ATO and 8uM AMN107, K562-r cells have the most significant coordinated effects (the apoptosis rate at 72h was 56.41% compared to 12.23% in ATO alone and 29.8% in AMN107 alone.). We studied gene expression series in K562-r cells with or without drug treatments by cDNA microarray analysis. Many genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling, including ATF3, DDIT3, HERPUD1, HSPA5, XBP1 and TXNDC12, were highly up-regulated within 12 h of co-treatment, suggesting that the combination of ATO with AMN107 induced an ER stress response leading to apoptosis later on. Other ER-stress markers like the JNK pathway, which bridges the ER-stress and apoptosis, have been activated. Knock down the initiator of JNK partially alleviate the effects of apoptosis (p<0.05). Co-administering AMN107 and arsenic trioxide, inducing apoptosis via the ER-stress, indicates a novel therapy alternative for the imatinib induced secondary resistance.

Untreated K562-r_0h used to counteracting the background.","The first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (imatinib) targets the kinase domain of BCR-ABL and induces apoptosis in newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). However, resistant and relapse are common problems in imatinib-treated patients. Although second-generation TKI such as AMN107 appears to improve the treatment of CML, TKI resistance and relapse are also frequently occurred in the patients. To test whether arsenic trioxide (ATO) could potentiate the efficacy of AMN107 in imatinib-resistant cells, we conducted a series of assays in TKI-resistant K562-r cells treated with AMN107 and ATO. Based on a time-course cDNA microarray analysis, we found many genes typically involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling were significantly up-regulated, implicating the occurrence of ER stress-mediated apoptosis in K562-r cells treated with the combination of ATO and AMN107. Such implication was also supported by the data showing the activation of members in the JNK pathway, which are known to be characteristic markers bridging ER-stress and apoptosis. Partial knock-down of the JNK activities alleviated the effects of apoptosis (p < 0.05) triggered by combining AMN107 with ATO. In conclusion, this study for the first time demonstrates a synergistic effect of AMN107 with ATO, allowing insights into the possible mechanisms underlying imatinib-induced resistance in CML. Our data also suggest that combination of AMN107 with ATO may represent a new strategy for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML patients.","['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Plant biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'Drug metabolism', 'Drug name', 'Drug report', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Operating system name', 'Biological system modelling', 'Kinase name', 'Workflows', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Genome alignment']"

These could be assembled into 21,937 contigs and 171,833 singletons, for which 6,951 had significant matches in public protein data bases.Our first transcriptomic analysis, comparing an early stage of scleroglucan synthesis in high-level and low-level producing media, uncovered that most differentially expressed unigenes belong to the functional categories ‘metabolism’ and ‘transport’ (Schmid et al., 2010). In order to get more insights into transcriptional regulation of scleroglucan production, we extended in this study our transcriptomic analyses. We determined transcriptomic profiles for a later stage of cultivation in both media, thus giving us the opportunity to study temporal phenomena under high- and low-level producing conditions.
Tailor-made microarrays (44K multiplex chip, Agilent) were designed by imaGenes (Berlin, Germany) using an in-house developed method for empirical selection of best performing probes for each gene (Pre Selection Strategy). Briefly, up to ten probes were designed for each of the 454 unigenes (60 bp long oligomers). The 244K Agilent test array was hybridized with pooled Cy3-labeled cRNAs gained form EPSmax13 and EPSmin17 cultures and (in average) two of the best performing oligos were selected for each unigene.   For comparative expression profiling, total RNA was isolated from S. rolfsii, cultured for 61 h in EPSmax13 (biological triplicate) and EPSmin17 media (biological triplicate).

We split the samples into a training set and a validation set. Using the supervised principal components survival analysis in the first cohort, we identified multiple gene expression profiles that predict the risk of recurrence. These profiles were then validated in the second independent cohort.ResultsGene models comprising different number of genes (40-100) identified a subgroup of patients who were at high risk of recurrence. Of these, the best prognostic model distinguished between a high- and a low-risk group (median DFS: 92 and 123 months, log rank p<0.005, permutation p<0.05), Hazard Ratio (HR): 8.51 (95% CI, 1.01 to 71.77; p<0.05).

21769946,"Downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is thought to be implicated in motor neuron excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the cytosolic C-terminus domain, impairing the transport activity and generating a proteolytic fragment found to be SUMO1 conjugated (CTE-SUMO1). We show here that this fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes in vivo throughout the disease stages of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. In vitro expression in spinal cord astrocytes of the C-terminus peptide of EAAT2 (CTE), which was artificially fused to SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1fus) to mimic the endogenous SUMOylation reaction, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation of the fragment seen in vivo and causes caspase-3 activation and axonal growth impairment in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary motor neurons co-cultured with CTE-SUMO1fus-expressing spinal cord astrocytes. This indicates that CTE-SUMO1fus could trigger non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1fus in astrocytes leads to their degeneration, although the time frame of the cell-autonomous toxicity is longer than the one for the indirect toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a SUMOylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could take part to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration in ALS.
Comparison is made between the toxic fragment (SUMO) and the same fragment without lysines that can be sumo-ylated (CTE). Four replicates have been performed for each sample group.","Dysregulation of glutamate handling ensuing downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is implicated in excitotoxic degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 (a.k.a. GLT-1) is cleaved by caspase-3 at its cytosolic carboxy-terminus domain. This cleavage results in impaired glutamate transport activity and generates a proteolytic fragment (CTE) that we found to be post-translationally conjugated by SUMO1. We show here that this sumoylated CTE fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS at symptomatic stages of disease. Astrocytic expression of CTE, artificially tagged with SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1) to mimic the native sumoylated fragment, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation pattern of the endogenous EAAT2-derived proteolytic fragment. Moreover, in a co-culture binary system, expression of CTE-SUMO1 in spinal cord astrocytes initiates extrinsic toxicity by inducing caspase-3 activation in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells or axonal growth impairment in primary motor neurons. Interestingly, prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1 is intrinsically toxic to spinal cord astrocytes, although this gliotoxic effect of CTE-SUMO1 occurs later than the indirect, noncell autonomous toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a sumoylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could participate to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration.","['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Axons/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motor Neurons/*drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/toxicity', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'JASPAR format', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide identifier', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Protein ID (PeroxiBase)']"

25246577,"Cancer results from molecular mutations occurring in specific cell types, thus determining the cell-of-origin is critical for effective cancer treatment. Inferring such information from terminal tumors can be misleading because malignant tumor cells tend to acquire aberrant properties. Animal models are widely used because one can initiate mutations in specific cell types. However, cell-of-mutation that harbors initial molecular changes may not directly transform, rather merely passes along mutations to its progeny cell lineage, which then serves as cell-of-origin and finally transforms into malignancy.   Such a problem is exemplified in the glioma field: glioma can be induced either by mutating tumor suppressor genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) or by over-expressing oncogenes in restricted progenitor cells such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). However, for the NSC glioma model, it remains unknown whether NSCs directly transform or simply pass along mutations to OPC lineage for malignancy. Here we use a genetic system termed Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) to study the earliest stage of gliomagenesis from mutated NSCs.   At an in vivo single-cell resolution, we unbiasedly analyzed tumorigenic potential of NSCs and all cell lineages derived from them. At pathologically undetectable pre-transforming phases, we found no significant aberrant growth of mutant NSCs and their derivatives except for the OPC lineage. We then tracked the tumor progression from earliest stage and confirmed the expansion of OPCs lead to gliomagenesis. Consistently, transcriptome profiling reveals that terminal-stage tumor cells display salient OPC features and resemble human proneural subtype of glioblastoma multiform (GBM).  Most importantly, introducing the same mutations directly into OPCs was sufficient for malignant transformation and these tumor cells are indistinguishable in their gene expression profiles from those in which the first mutations were introduced into NSCs. Our findings strongly implicate OPCs as the transforming cell type for glioma even when initial mutations could occur in NSCs, and highlight the importance of analyzing early phases of tumorigenesis to distinguish cell-of-origin from cell-of-mutation.
44K Mouse Development Oligo Microarrays from Agilent Technologies were used for microarray analysis. For each experiment, total RNA was fluorescently labeled and hybridized directly against a common reference sample generated from the RNA pool of four WT P17 mouse brain neocortex.","How malignant gliomas arise in a mature brain remains a mystery, hindering the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. We previously showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can be transformed into glioma when mutations are introduced perinatally. However, adult OPCs rarely proliferate compared with their perinatal counterparts. Whether these relatively quiescent cells have the potential to transform is unknown, which is a critical question considering the late onset of human glioma. Additionally, the premalignant events taking place between initial mutation and a fully developed tumor mass are particularly poorly understood in glioma. Here we used a temporally controllable Cre transgene to delete p53 and NF1 specifically in adult OPCs and demonstrated that these cells consistently give rise to malignant gliomas. To investigate the transforming process of quiescent adult OPCs, we then tracked these cells throughout the premalignant phase, which revealed a dynamic multistep transformation, starting with rapid but transient hyperproliferative reactivation, followed by a long period of dormancy, and then final malignant transformation. Using pharmacological approaches, we discovered that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is critical for both the initial OPC reactivation step and late-stage tumor cell proliferation and thus might be a potential target for both glioma prevention and treatment. In summary, our results firmly establish the transforming potential of adult OPCs and reveal an actionable multiphasic reactivation process that turns slowly dividing OPCs into malignant gliomas.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glioma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Strain name', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Mice or rats', 'Informatics', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Transcription', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structural data', 'Structure clustering', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Dendrogram visualisation', 'Dendrograph plotting', 'ClustalW dendrogram', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Tumor annotation', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Protein data']"

Goal was to determine the effects of BdkrB2 receptor knockout together with gestational high salt stress on renal gene expression pattern.
Two-condition experiment, BdkrB2 null mouse kidney vs. BdkrB2 WT mosue kidney with both on gestational high salt stress .

Our previous work has shown that Bdkrb2 also plays a developmental role since Bdkrb2(-/-) embryos, but not their wild-type or heterozygous littermates, are prone to renal dysgenesis in response to gestational high salt intake. Although impaired terminal differentiation and apoptosis are consistent findings in the Bdkrb2(-/-) mutant kidneys, the developmental pathways downstream of gene-environment interactions leading to the renal phenotype remain unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling on embryonic kidneys from salt-stressed Bdkrb2(+/+) and Bdkrb2(-/-) embryos. The results reveal significant alterations in key pathways regulating Wnt signaling, apoptosis, embryonic development, and cell-matrix interactions. In silico analysis reveal that nearly 12% of differentially regulated genes harbor one or more Pax2 DNA-binding sites in their promoter region. Further analysis shows that metanephric kidneys of salt-stressed Bdkrb2(-/-) have a significant downregulation of Pax2 gene expression. This was corroborated in Bdkrb2(-/-);Pax2(GFP+/tg) mice, demonstrating that Pax2 transcriptional activity is significantly repressed by gestational salt-Bdkrb2 interactions. We conclude that gestational gene (Bdkrb2) and environment (salt) interactions cooperate to impact gene expression programs in the developing kidney.

22964890,"Transcription factors (TFs) in concert with chromatin pathways stably reset transcriptional programs during differentiation. Yet we know little how local sites of chromatin reprogramming are specified and how the estimated 3000 TF encoded in mammalian genomes contribute to chromatin dynamics. To identify candidate TFs we developed an integrated computational approach (Epi-MARA) that models chromatin dynamics in terms of predicted transcription factor binding sites and show that it correctly predicts key TFs involved in epigenome reorganization.  When applied to a time course of genome-wide H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a chromatin mark set by the Polycomb system, during neuronal differentiation of murine stem cells Epi-MARA predicted that the repressive transcription factor REST contributes to a gain of H3K27me3 at a subset of promoters during the transition from the stem to the progenitor state. To test this prediction we identified, genome-wide, the actual binding sites of REST and H3K27me3 during the differentiation in cells that are either wildtype or in which REST had been deleted. REST indeed localizes to a subset of sites that gain H3K27me3 in progenitors. Importantly, absence of REST in trans leads to a loss of H3K27me3 predominantly in the neuronal progenitor state and specifically at those regions where REST was bound. This function further requires REST binding sites in cis as their mutation leads to substantial loss of H3K27me3.   Taken together we provide a novel approach to identify epigenome and TF crosstalk during cellular reprogramming and prove experimentally the prediction that REST acts as an important recruiter of Polycomb repression during early steps of neurogenesis.
Dataset comprises of 15 ChIP-seq samples using chromatin from embryonic stem (ES) and neuronal progentor (NP) of wildtype and RESTko cells, which was immunoprecipitated, using antibodies against REST, H3K27me3, or Suz12","Although changes in chromatin are integral to transcriptional reprogramming during cellular differentiation, it is currently unclear how chromatin modifications are targeted to specific loci. To systematically identify transcription factors (TFs) that can direct chromatin changes during cell fate decisions, we model the relationship between genome-wide dynamics of chromatin marks and the local occurrence of computationally predicted TF binding sites. By applying this computational approach to a time course of Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 marks during neuronal differentiation of murine stem cells, we identify several motifs that likely regulate the dynamics of this chromatin mark. Among these, the sites bound by REST and by the SNAIL family of TFs are predicted to transiently recruit H3K27me3 in neuronal progenitors. We validate these predictions experimentally and show that absence of REST indeed causes loss of H3K27me3 at target promoters in trans, specifically at the neuronal progenitor state. Moreover, using targeted transgenic insertion, we show that promoter fragments containing REST or SNAIL binding sites are sufficient to recruit H3K27me3 in cis, while deletion of these sites results in loss of H3K27me3. These findings illustrate that the occurrence of TF binding sites can determine chromatin dynamics. Local determination of Polycomb activity by REST and SNAIL motifs exemplifies such TF based regulation of chromatin. Furthermore, our results show that key TFs can be identified ab initio through computational modeling of epigenome data sets using a modeling approach that we make readily accessible.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Dogs', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Macaca', 'Mice', '*Models, Genetic', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Opossums', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transgenes']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', ""Ensembl ID ('Macaca mulatta')"", 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic engineering', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'HET group name', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcript report']"

These findings might aid in designing aggressive treatment regimens and help to provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets.Results: Increased incidence of p53 mutations in MSS CRCs (58%) was associated with higher CRC-specific mortality than MSS-p53 wild-type phenotypes (log-rank, P=0.025; and hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.08).

p53 wild type vs. mutant tumor samples","Although the prognostic value of p53 abnormalities in Stage III microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers (CRCs) is known, the gene expression profiles specific to the p53 status in the MSS background are not known. Therefore, the current investigation has focused on identification and validation of the gene expression profiles associated with p53 mutant phenotypes in MSS Stage III CRCs. Genomic DNA extracted from 135 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, was analyzed for microsatellite instability (MSI) and p53 mutations. Further, mRNA samples extracted from five p53-mutant and five p53-wild-type MSS-CRC snap-frozen tissues were profiled for differential gene expression by Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Differentially expressed genes were further validated by the high-throughput quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA), and confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. A higher incidence of p53 mutations was found in MSS (58%) than in MSI (30%) phenotypes. Both univariate (log-rank, P = 0.025) and multivariate (hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.08) analyses have demonstrated that patients with MSS-p53 mutant phenotypes had poor CRC-specific survival when compared to MSS-p53 wild-type phenotypes.

21498622,"Oxidative stress can arise when in vitro propagated plants developed under low light conditions are exposed to high light during transfer to ex vitro conditions. In such a situation, among the many potential stresses to which the transferred plant can be exposed, oxidative stress is commonly experienced, most likely brought about by absorption of light energy in excess of that required for very low levels of photosynthetic metabolism. In vitro propagated grapevine when transferred to ex vitro conditions with a 4 fold increase in PPFD shows an initial inhibition of PET accompanied by an accumulation of H2O2, suggesting a signal for the upregulation in gene expression and antioxidant enzyme activity, which peaked at 48h after transfer of in vitro grapevine to ex vitro growing conditions.When in vitro propagated plants are exposed to high light upon transfer to ex vitro oxidative stress symptoms occur. To determine whether the underlying pathways activated at the transfer of in vitro grapevine to ex vitro conditions reflect the processes occurring upon light stress we used microarrays.
Leaves were harvested from in vitro grown plants immediately prior to transfer to ex vitro condition and 48h after transfer to compare gene expression before and after exposure of these plants to the high light conditions typical of ex vitro growth.","Understanding abiotic stress responses is one of the most important issues in plant research nowadays. Abiotic stress, including excess light, can promote the onset of oxidative stress through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress also arises when in vitro propagated plants are exposed to high light upon transfer to ex vitro. To determine whether the underlying pathways activated at the transfer of in vitro grapevine to ex vitro conditions reflect the processes occurring upon light stress, we used Vitis vinifera Affymetrix GeneChip (VvGA) and a custom array of genes responsive to light stress (LSCA) detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). When gene-expression profiles were compared, 'protein metabolism and modification', 'signaling', and 'anti-oxidative' genes were more represented in LSCA, while, in VvGA, 'cell wall metabolism' and 'secondary metabolism' were the categories in which gene expression varied more significantly. The above functional categories confirm previous studies involving other types of abiotic stresses, enhancing the common attributes of abiotic stress defense pathways. The LSCA analysis of our experimental system detected strong response of heat shock genes, particularly the protein rescuing mechanism involving the cooperation of two ATP-dependent chaperone systems, Hsp100 and Hsp70, which showed an unusually late response during the recovery period, of extreme relevance to remove non-functional, potentially harmful polypeptides arising from misfolding, denaturation, or aggregation brought about by stress.

More recently, it was shown that NMD also directly regulates subsets of normal transcripts, suggesting that NMD has roles in normal biological processes. Indeed, several NMD factors have been shown to regulate neurological events (for example, neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity) in numerous vertebrate species. In man, mutations in the NMD factor gene UPF3B, which disrupts a branch of the NMD pathway, cause various forms of intellectual disability (ID). Using Epstein Barr virus-immortalized B cells, also known as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), from ID patients that have loss-of-function mutations in UPF3B, we investigated the genome-wide consequences of compromised NMD and the role of NMD in neuronal development and function. We found that ~5% of the human transcriptome is impacted in UPF3B patients. The UPF3B paralog, UPF3A, is stabilized in all UPF3B patients, and partially compensates for the loss of UPF3B function. Interestingly, UPF3A protein, but not mRNA, was stabilised in a quantitative manner that inversely correlated with the severity of patients' phenotype. This suggested that the ability to stabilize the UPF3A protein is a crucial modifier of the neurological symptoms due to loss of UPF3B. We also identified ARHGAP24, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein, as a canonical target of NMD, and we provide evidence that deregulation of this gene inhibits axon and dendrite outgrowth and branching.

However, these technologies suffer from several limits and drawbacks and, to date, information about rare, even though relevant, RNA species such as long and small non-coding RNAs, is completely missing. Indeed, none of published works has still described the whole transcriptional landscape of Down syndrome. Although the recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing have revealed the complexity of transcriptomes, most of them rely on polyA enrichment protocols, able to detect only a small fraction of total RNA content. On the opposite end, massive-scale RNA sequencing on rRNA-depleted samples allows the survey of the complete set of coding and non-coding RNA species, now emerging as novel contributors to pathogenic mechanisms. Hence, in this work we analysed for the first time the complete transcriptome of human trisomic endothelial progenitor cells to an unprecedented level of resolution and sensitivity by RNA-sequencing. Our analysis allowed us to detect differential expression of even low expressed genes crucial for the pathogenesis, to disclose novel regions of active transcription outside yet annotated loci, and to investigate a plethora of non-polyadenylated long as well as short non coding RNAs. Novel splice isoforms for a large subset of crucial genes, and novel extended untranslated regions for known genes--possibly novel miRNA targets or regulatory sites for gene transcription--were also identified in this study. Coupling the rRNA depletion of samples, followed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing, to the easy availability of these cells renders this approach very feasible for transcriptome studies, offering the possibility of investigating in-depth blood-related pathological features of Down syndrome, as well as other genetic disorders.","['Alternative Splicing', '*Down Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA/chemistry/*genetics']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'R markdown', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"

However, the role of Nod1 and Nod2 and their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation. Furthermore, Nod1- and Nod2-mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on Nod1 and Nod2 and their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L. monocytogenes was critically dependent on Nod1 and Nod2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, Nod1 and Nod2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation.","['Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine/immunology', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytosol/immunology/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Listeria monocytogenes/immunology', 'Listeriosis/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nod1 Signaling Adaptor Protein/immunology/*metabolism', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/immunology/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'ID list', 'Term ID list', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Codon usage fraction calculation', 'Reaction data', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein active sites', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein signature', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Protein interactions', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

21602358,Unknown strain of increasingly prevalent infectious serovar.,"Despite extensive surveillance, food-borne Salmonella enterica infections continue to be a significant burden on public health systems worldwide. As the S. enterica species comprises sublineages that differ greatly in antigenic representation, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, a better understanding of the species' evolution is critical for the prediction and prevention of future outbreaks. The roles that virulence and resistance phenotype acquisition, exchange, and loss play in the evolution of S. enterica sublineages, which to a certain extent are represented by serotypes, remains mostly uncharacterized. Here, we compare 17 newly sequenced and phenotypically characterized nontyphoidal S. enterica strains to 11 previously sequenced S. enterica genomes to carry out the most comprehensive comparative analysis of this species so far. These phenotypic and genotypic data comparisons in the phylogenetic species context suggest that the evolution of known S. enterica sublineages is mediated mostly by two mechanisms, (i) the loss of coding sequences with known metabolic functions, which leads to functional reduction, and (ii) the acquisition of horizontally transferred phage and plasmid DNA, which provides virulence and resistance functions and leads to increasing specialization. Matches between S. enterica clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), part of a defense mechanism against invading plasmid and phage DNA, and plasmid and prophage regions suggest that CRISPR-mediated immunity could control short-term phenotype changes and mediate long-term sublineage evolution. CRISPR analysis could therefore be critical in assessing the evolutionary potential of S. enterica sublineages and aid in the prediction and prevention of future S. enterica outbreaks.","['*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Bacterial', '*Genomics', 'Humans', '*Inverted Repeat Sequences', 'Phylogeny', 'Salmonella Infections/microbiology', 'Salmonella enterica/classification/*genetics']","['Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Repeat sequences', 'Sequence', 'Sanger inverted repeats', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Protein interactions']"
23204237,Homo sapiens Targeted Locus (Loci),"Low-grade prostate cancers (Gleason pattern 3, G3) detected on needle biopsies are generally viewed as indolent and suitable for conservative management with only interval repeat biopsies to monitor by watchful waiting. Higher grade tumors eventually emerge in 20% to 30% of these cases, but this process may only reflect incomplete sampling on the initial biopsy, such that it remains unknown whether G3 tumors generally progress to higher grades. In this study, we examined a series of adjacent G3 and Gleason pattern 4 (G4) tumors in radical prostatectomy specimens and found that all were concordant for the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. Using hybrid-capture and deep sequencing in four fusion-positive cases, we found that adjacent laser-capture microdissected G3 and G4 tumors had identical TMPRSS2:ERG fusion breakpoints, confirming their clonal origin. Two of these G3 tumors had deletion of a single PTEN gene that was also deleted in the adjacent G4, while the G4 tumors in two cases had additional PTEN losses. These findings establish that a subset of G3 tumors progress to G4 or emerge from a common precursor. Further, they show that G3 tumors that progress to G4 may have molecular features distinguishing them from G3 tumors that do not progress. Thus, determining the spectrum of these genetic or epigenetic features may allow for the identification of G3 tumors on needle biopsies that are truly indolent versus those that have the potential to progress or that may already be associated with a G4 tumor that was not sampled at the initial biopsy, therefore, requiring more aggressive surveillance or intervention.","['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']","['Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Parsing', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Nc statistic']"

This question is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in which evidence suggests that metabolic events in podocytes regulate chromatin structure. Here, we show that miR-93 is a critical metabolic/epigenetic switch in the diabetic milieu linking the metabolic state to chromatin remodelling. Mice with inducible overexpression of a miR-93 transgene exclusively in podocytes exhibit significant improvements in key features of DN. We identify miR-93 as a regulator of nucleosomal dynamics in podocytes. miR-93 has a critical role in chromatin reorganization and progression of DN by modulating its target Msk2, a histone kinase, and its substrate H3S10. These findings implicate a central role for miR-93 in high glucose-induced chromatin remodelling in the kidney, and provide evidence for a previously unrecognized role for Msk2 as a target for DN therapy.","['Aged', 'Animals', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*complications/metabolism', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*etiology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Podocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/*metabolism']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Gene transcription', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'protein', 'Ribosomes', 'Protein databases']"

However, use of FFPE samples in genomic studies has been limited by technical challenges resulting from nucleic acid degradation. Here we evaluated gene expression profiles derived from fresh-frozen (FRO) and FFPE mouse liver tissues preserved in formalin for different amounts of time using 2 DNA microarray protocols and 2 whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation methodologies. The ribo-depletion protocol outperformed the other methods by having the highest correlations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and best overlap of pathways, between FRO and FFPE groups. The effect of sample time in formalin (18 h or 3 weeks) on gene expression profiles indicated that test article treatment, not preservation method, was the main driver of gene expression profiles. Meta- and pathway analyses indicated that biological responses were generally consistent for 18 h and 3 week FFPE samples compared with FRO samples. However, clear erosion of signal intensity with time in formalin was evident, and DEG numbers differed by platform and preservation method. Lastly, we investigated the effect of time in paraffin on genomic profiles. Ribo-depletion RNA-seq analysis of 8-, 19-, and 26-year-old control blocks resulted in comparable quality metrics, including expected distributions of mapped reads to exonic, untranslated region, intronic, and ribosomal fractions of the transcriptome. Overall, our results indicate that FFPE samples are appropriate for use in genomic studies in which frozen samples are not available, and that ribo-depletion RNA-seq is the preferred method for this type of analysis in archival and long-aged FFPE samples.","['Animals', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', '*Fixatives', '*Formaldehyde', '*Frozen Sections', 'Furans/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Paraffin Embedding', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Fixation/*methods']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Database', 'Format', 'GCT/Res format', 'Map format', 'Selection detection', 'Sample collections', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Read mapping', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture']"

We therefore investigated alterations in the transcriptomes, miRNAomes and DNA methylomes in the same CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from newborn (NB), middle-aged (MA) and long-lived (LL) individuals to elucidate the molecular changes and their interactions. A total 659 genes showed significantly expression changes across NB, MA and LL individuals, in which we identified four age-related co-expression modules with three hub networks of co-expressed genes and non-coding RNAs. Moreover, we identified 9835 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including 7015 hypermethylated and 2820 hypomethylated DMRs in the NB compared with the MA, and 12,362 DMRs including 4809 hypermethylated and 7553 hypomethylated DMRs in the MA compared with the LL. The integrated analysis revealed a potential relationship between genes transcription and DNA methylation for many age- or immune-related genes, suggesting that DNA methylation-dependent transcription regulation is involved in development and functions of T cells during aging. Our results reveals age-related transcription and methylation changes and their interactions in human T cells from the cradle to the grave.

29251172,Transcriptome analysis of normal and cancerous bladder tissues.,"Personalized medicine implies that distinct treatment methods are prescribed to individual patients according several features that may be obtained from, e.g., gene expression profile.

At the same time, there exist thousands of various cell lines that were treated with hundreds of anti-cancer drugs in order to check the ability of these drugs to stop the cell proliferation, and all these cell line cultures were profiled in terms of their gene expression. Here we present a new approach in machine learning, which can predict clinical efficiency of anti-cancer drugs for individual patients by transferring features obtained from the expression-based data from cell lines.

Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) silique using RNA sequencing. In doing so, we have generated a data set of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth and, subsequently, trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our data set has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our data set play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Flowers/genetics/growth & development', 'Fruit/*genetics/growth & development', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeostasis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Genetics', 'Seeds/genetics/growth & development', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Transcriptome']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Power test', 'SFF', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression profile', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene report', 'Report', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Epistasis', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Genetics', 'Reverse complement', 'Phylogenetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

To investigate the influence of chromatin organisation and dynamics on the response to Notch signalling, we partitioned Drosophila chromatin using histone modifications and established the preferred chromatin conditions for binding of Su(H), the Notch pathway transcription factor. By manipulating activity of a co-operating factor, Lozenge/Runx, we showed that it can help facilitate these conditions. While many histone modifications were unchanged by Su(H) binding or Notch activation, we detected rapid changes in acetylation of H3K56 at Notch-regulated enhancers. This modification extended over large regions, required the histone acetyl-transferase CBP and was independent of transcription. Such rapid changes in H3K56 acetylation appear to be a conserved indicator of enhancer activation as they also occurred at the mammalian Notch-regulated Hey1 gene and at Drosophila ecdysone-regulated genes.

Histone mRNAs are unique among mammalian mRNAs because they are not normally polyadenylated but, rather, are cleaved following a 3' stem loop. A significant reduction in correctly processed histone mRNAs was observed following Ars2 depletion, concurrent with an increase in polyadenylated histone transcripts. Furthermore, Ars2 physically associated with histone mRNAs and the noncoding RNA 7SK. Knockdown of 7SK led to an enhanced ratio of cleaved to polyadenylated histone transcripts, an effect dependent on Ars2.

Since SigF is not an abundant protein in the logarithmic phase of growth, a pristinamyin IA-inducible system was used to control its expression. We identified 67 high-affinity SigF-binding sites and 16 loci where a SigF promoter directs the expression of a transcript. These loci include sigF itself, genes involved in lipid and intermediary metabolism and virulence, and at least one transcriptional regulator (Rv2884), possibly acting downstream of SigF. In addition, SigF was also found to direct the transcription of the gene for small RNA F6. Many loci were also found where SigF may be involved in antisense transcription, and in two cases (Rv1358 and Rv1870c) the SigF-dependent promoter was located within the predicted coding sequence. Quantitative PCR confirmed the microarray findings and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to map the SigF-specific transcriptional start points. A canonical SigF consensus promoter sequence GGTTT-N((15-17))-GGGTA was found prior to 11 genes. Together, these data help to define the SigF regulon and show that SigF not only governs expression of proteins such as the virulence factor, HbhA, but also impacts novel functions, such as noncoding RNAs and antisense transcripts.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Composition', 'DNA, Antisense', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/*physiology', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/metabolism', 'Sigma Factor/genetics/*metabolism']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Sequence composition report', 'Word composition', 'Protein sequence composition', 'DNA', 'dna', 'DNA sense specification', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'PCR experiment', 'CHAIN', 'Reaction ID', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA translation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
17101775,"Tiling ChIP-CHIP Ssn6-GFP, Tp11-GFP, Tup12-GFP and Hst4 vs WT Expression
6 Samples","The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssn6 and Tup1 proteins form a corepressor complex that is recruited to target genes by DNA-bound repressor proteins. Repression occurs via several mechanisms, including interaction with hypoacetylated N termini of histones, recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and interactions with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The distantly related fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has two partially redundant Tup1-like proteins that are dispensable during normal growth. In contrast, we show that Ssn6 is an essential protein in S. pombe, suggesting a function that is independent of Tup11 and Tup12. Consistently, the group of genes that requires Ssn6 for their regulation overlaps but is distinct from the group of genes that depend on Tup11 or Tup12. Global chip-on-chip analysis shows that Ssn6 is almost invariably found in the same genomic locations as Tup11 and/or Tup12. All three corepressor subunits are generally bound to genes that are selectively regulated by Ssn6 or Tup11/12, and thus, the subunit specificity is probably manifested in the context of a corepressor complex containing all three subunits. The corepressor binds to both the intergenic and coding regions of genes, but differential localization of the corepressor within genes does not appear to account for the selective dependence of target genes on the Ssn6 or Tup11/12 subunits. Ssn6, Tup11, and Tup12 are preferentially found at genomic locations at which histones are deacetylated, primarily by the Clr6 class I HDAC. Clr6 is also important for the repression of corepressor target genes. Interestingly, a subset of corepressor target genes, including direct target genes affected by Ssn6 overexpression, is associated with the function of class II (Clr3) and III (Hst4 and Sir2) HDACs.","['Acetylation', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Intergenic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Essential', 'Genes, Fungal/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Subunits/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/cytology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/*metabolism']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Essential dynamics', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'PHYLIP sequential', 'Fungi', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Histogram', 'protein', 'MRI', 'Threading', 'Protein threading', 'Open science', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Protein report', 'Transposon prediction', 'Protein report format', 'Protein expression', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID']"

Despite extensive research in this area, the resolution of insect phylogeny especially of interordinal relationships has turned out to be still a great challenge. One of the challenges for insect systematics is the radiation of the polyneopteran lineages with several contradictory and/or unresolved relationships. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic data for three enigmatic polyneopteran orders (Dermaptera, Plecoptera, and Zoraptera) to clarify one of the most debated issues among higher insect systematics. We applied different approaches to generate 3 data sets comprising 78 species and 1,579 clusters of orthologous genes. Using these three matrices, we explored several key mechanistic problems of phylogenetic reconstruction including missing data, matrix selection, gene and taxa number/choice, and the biological function of the genes. Based on the first phylogenomic approach including these three ambiguous polyneopteran orders, we provide here conclusive support for monophyletic Polyneoptera, contesting the hypothesis of Zoraptera + Paraneoptera and Plecoptera + remaining Neoptera. In addition, we employ various approaches to evaluate data quality and highlight problematic nodes within the Insect Tree that still exist despite our phylogenomic approach. We further show how the support for these nodes or alternative hypotheses might depend on the taxon- and/or gene-sampling.","['Animals', 'Classification', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Genome, Insect', 'Genomics', 'Insecta/classification/*genetics', '*Phylogeny', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Classification', 'Gene classification', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Genome index', 'Genome report', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
33378320,Mesenchymal stem cells reduce inflammation while enhancing bacterial clearance and improving survival in sepsis.,"Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (MD) is an important pathophysiological feature of multiorgan failure caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Patients with MD continue to be managed in intensive care units with limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling disease pathogenesis. Emerging evidences support the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy for treating critically ill septic patients. Combining this with the known role that microRNAs (miRNAs) play in reversing sepsis-induced myocardial-dysfunction, this study sought to investigate how MSC administration alters miRNA expression in the heart. Mice were randomized to experimental polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham surgery, treated with either MSCs (2.5 × 105) or placebo (saline). Twenty-eight hours post-intervention, RNA was collected from whole hearts for transcriptomic and microRNA profiling. The top microRNAs differentially regulated in hearts by CLP and MSC administration were used to generate a putative mRNA-miRNA interaction network. Key genes, termed hub genes, within the network were then identified and further validated in vivo. Network analysis and RT-qPCR revealed that septic hearts treated with MSCs resulted in upregulation of five miRNAs, including miR-187, and decrease in three top hit putative hub genes (Itpkc, Lrrc59, and Tbl1xr1). Functionally, MSC administration decreased inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, while increasing cardiac-specific structural and functional, gene expression. Taken together, our data suggest that MSC administration regulates host-derived miRNAs production to protect cardiomyocytes from sepsis-induced MD.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Heart', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Random Allocation', 'Sepsis/*genetics/*microbiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'MAT', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Random sequence generation', 'Sequence mutation and randomisation', 'EMBL feature location', 'Sequence analysis']"

Comparison of the 16S rDNA sequence of strain LMG 21460T indicated close relationships (approximately 99% similarity) to Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. However, DNA hybridization experiments revealed similarity values below 70% with its closest species V. campbellii and V. harveyi. Additionally, the analysed strains differ from related Vibrio species by the utilization of melibiose and production of acid from L-arabinose and amygdalin. Among the strains analysed, differences were observed in some phenotypic characters, particularly susceptibility to ampicillin, polymyxin B and amikacin, and urease activity.

23795291,Gene expression data of Lsd1fl/fl and Lsd1fl/fl EpoRCre CD71_high / c-Kit_high pro-erythroblasts.,"Here, we describe that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1/KDM1a), which demethylates histone H3 on Lys4 or Lys9 (H3K4/K9), is an indispensible epigenetic governor of hematopoietic differentiation. Integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of Lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates H3K4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that Lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions. Loss of Lsd1 was associated with increased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation on HSPC genes and gene derepression. Failure to fully silence HSPC genes compromised differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as mature blood cell lineages. Collectively, our data indicate that Lsd1-mediated concurrent repression of enhancer and promoter activity of stem and progenitor cell genes is a pivotal epigenetic mechanism required for proper hematopoietic maturation.

Recently, genome-wide nucleosome mapping has revealed more detailed information on the chromatin-remodelling factors. Here, we report that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe CHD remodeller, Hrp3, is a global regulator that drives proper nucleosome positioning and nucleosome stability. The loss of Hrp3 resulted in nucleosome perturbation across the chromosome, and the production of antisense transcripts in the hrp3Δ cells emphasized the importance of nucleosome architecture for proper transcription. Notably, perturbation of the nucleosome in hrp3 deletion mutant was also associated with destabilization of the DNA-histone interaction and cell cycle-dependent alleviation of heterochromatin silencing. Furthermore, the effect of Hrp3 in the pericentric region was found to be accomplished via a physical interaction with Swi6, and appeared to cooperate with other heterochromatin factors for gene silencing. Taken together, our data indicate that a well-positioned nucleosome by Hrp3 is important for the spatial-temporal control of transcription-associated processes.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Euchromatin/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Fungal', 'Heterochromatin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Phosphorylation sites', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Proteins', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Histogram', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA sense specification', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'protein', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
22638070,Genome-wide Profiling of Progesterone Receptor and GATA2 Binding in the Mouse Uterus,"Progesterone (P4) signaling through its nuclear transcription factor, the progesterone receptor (PR), is essential for normal uterine function. Although deregulation of PR-mediated signaling is known to underscore uterine dysfunction and a number of endometrial pathologies, the early molecular mechanisms of this deregulation are unclear. To address this issue, we have defined the genome-wide PR cistrome in the murine uterus using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). In uteri of ovariectomized mice, we identified 6367 PR-binding sites in the absence of P4 ligand; however, this number increased at nearly 3-fold (18,432) after acute P4 exposure. Sequence analysis revealed that approximately 73% of these binding sites contain a progesterone response element or a half-site motif recognized by the PR. Many previously identified P4 target genes known to regulate uterine function were found to contain PR-binding sites, confirming the validity of our methodology. Interestingly, when the ChIP-seq data were coupled with our microarray expression data, we identified a novel regulatory role for uterine P4 in circadian rhythm gene expression, thereby uncovering a hitherto unexpected new circadian biology for P4 in this tissue. Further mining of the ChIP-seq data revealed Sox17 as a direct transcriptional PR target gene in the uterus. As a member of the Sox transcription factor family, Sox17 represents a potentially novel mediator of PR action in the murine uterus. Collectively, our first line of analysis of the uterine PR cistrome provides the first insights into the early molecular mechanisms that underpin normal uterine responsiveness to acute P4 exposure. Future analysis promises to reveal the PR interactome and, in turn, potential therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and/or treatment of endometrial dysfunction.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Female', 'Genome', 'HMGB Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Progesterone/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Uterus/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'consensus', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Consensus-based sequence alignment', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence annotation', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Virus identifier']"

24602001,Gene expression profile of duodenal follicular lymphoma,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly duodenal follicular lymphoma (DFL), is a rare variant of FL with indolent clinical behavior, and this disease is included in the 2008 World Health Organization classification system. In contrast to nodal follicular lymphoma (NFL), DFL occurs most frequently in the second part of the duodenum, lacks follicular dendritic cell meshworks and has memory B-cell characteristics. However, its molecular pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we examined 10 DFL, 18 NFL and 10 gastric MALT lymphoma samples using gene expression analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments and immunohistochemical analysis for 72 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from an independent series, including 32 DFL, 19 gastric MALT lymphoma and 27 NFL samples, were performed for validation of microarray data. Gene expression profiles of the three lymphoma types were compared using 2918 differentially expressed genes (DEG) and results suggested that DFL shares characteristics of MALT lymphoma. Among these DEG, CCL20 and MAdCAM-1 were upregulated in DFL and MALT but downregulated in NFL. In contrast, protocadherin gamma subfamily genes were upregulated in DFL and NFL. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated concordant results. Double immunofluorescence studies revealed that CCL20 and CCR6 were co-expressed in both DFL and MALT. We hypothesize that increased expression of CCL20 and MAdCAM-1 and co-expression of CCL20 and CCR6 may play an important role in tumorigenesis.","['Cadherins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chemokine CCL20/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Duodenal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Duodenum/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucoproteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, CCR6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']","['Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acid features (immunoglobulin gene structure)', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunogen design', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence motif data', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Lipoproteins', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"

Ironically, similar studies have not been conducted in the model bacterium E coli K12, thus it is unknown whether or not the bacterium possesses similar complex transcriptomes.

24391972,Identification of Adaptive mutations in the influenza A virus non-structural 1 gene that increase cytoplasmic localization and differentially regulate host gene expression,"The NS1 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a multifunctional virulence factor. We have previously characterized gain-of-function mutations in the NS1 protein arising from the experimental adaptation of the human isolate A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) (HK) to the mouse. The majority of these mouse adapted NS1 mutations were demonstrated to increase virulence, viral fitness, and interferon antagonism, but differ in binding to the post-transcriptional processing factor cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30). Because nuclear trafficking is a major genetic determinant of influenza virus host adaptation, we assessed subcellular localization and host gene expression of NS1 adaptive mutations. Recombinant HK viruses with adaptive mutations in the NS1 gene were assessed for NS1 protein subcellular localization in mouse and human cells using confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation. In human cells the HK wild-type (HK-wt) virus NS1 protein partitioned equivalently between the cytoplasm and nucleus but was defective in cytoplasmic localization in mouse cells. Several adaptive mutations increased the proportion of NS1 in the cytoplasm of mouse cells with the greatest effects for mutations M106I and D125G. The host gene expression profile of the adaptive mutants was determined by microarray analysis of infected mouse cells to show either high or low extents of host-gene regulation (HGR or LGR) phenotypes. While host genes were predominantly down regulated for the HGR group of mutants (D2N, V23A, F103L, M106I+L98S, L98S, M106V, and M106V+M124I), the LGR phenotype mutants (D125G, M106I, V180A, V226I, and R227K) were characterized by a predominant up regulation of host genes. CPSF30 binding affinity of NS1 mutants did not predict effects on host gene expression.

24630726,The SWI/SNF Complex Regulates the PRDM Protein Hamlet to Ensure Lineage Directionality in Drosophila Neural Stem Cells,"Members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer, but how they suppress tumorigenesis is currently unclear. Here, we use Drosophila neuroblasts to demonstrate that the SWI/SNF component Osa (ARID1) prevents tumorigenesis by ensuring correct lineage progression in stem cell lineages. We show that Osa induces a transcriptional program in the transit-amplifying population that initiates temporal patterning, limits self-renewal, and prevents dedifferentiation. We identify the Prdm protein Hamlet as a key component of this program. Hamlet is directly induced by Osa and regulates the progression of progenitors through distinct transcriptional states to limit the number of transit-amplifying divisions. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the widespread tumor suppressor activity of SWI/SNF. Because the Hamlet homologs Evi1 and Prdm16 are frequently mutated in cancer, this mechanism could well be conserved in human stem cell lineages.

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and deep-sequencing (seq) to identify AR-binding sites (ARBSs). We found that the number of ARBSs and the AR-binding strength were positively associated with the level of AR when cells were stimulated with low concentrations of androgens. In cells overexpressing AR, the chromatin binding of the receptor took place in 100-fold lower concentration of the ligand than in control cells. We confirmed the association of AR level and chromatin binding in two PC xenografts, one containing AR gene amplification with high AR expression, and the other with low expression. By combining the ChIP-seq and expression profiling, we identified AR target genes that are upregulated in PC. Of them, the expression of ZWINT, SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45)) and FEN1 (flap structure-specific endonuclease 1) was demonstrated to be increased in CRPC, while the expression of SNAI2 was decreased in both PC and CRPC. FEN1 protein expression was also associated with poor prognosis in prostatectomy-treated patients. Finally, the knock-down of FEN1 with small interfering RNA inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells. Our data demonstrate that the overexpression of AR sensitizes the receptor binding to chromatin, thus, explaining how AR signaling pathway is reactivated in CRPC cells.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Flap Endonucleases/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics/*metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Amplification detection', 'Gene classification', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Nucleic acid classification', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Kinase name', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Transposon prediction']"
24987116,Minimal metabolic pathway structure is consistent with associated macromolecular interactions.,"Pathways are a universal paradigm for functionally describing cellular processes. Even though advances in high-throughput data generation have transformed biology, the core of our biological understanding, and hence data interpretation, is still predicated on human-defined pathways. Here, we introduce an unbiased, pathway structure for genome-scale metabolic networks defined based on principles of parsimony that do not mimic canonical human-defined textbook pathways. Instead, these minimal pathways better describe multiple independent pathway-associated biomolecular interaction datasets suggesting a functional organization for metabolism based on parsimonious use of cellular components. We use the inherent predictive capability of these pathways to experimentally discover novel transcriptional regulatory interactions in Escherichia coli metabolism for three transcription factors, effectively doubling the known regulatory roles for Nac and MntR. This study suggests an underlying and fundamental principle in the evolutionary selection of pathway structures; namely, that pathways may be minimal, independent, and segregated.","['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genome', 'Humans', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Models, Genetic']","['Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Metabolic pathways', 'Metabolic pathway report', 'Metabolic pathway prediction', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map']"
26446258,"These findings reveal the global chromatin response to UV damage and its relation to impaired gene regulation
Comparison of FAIRE-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data for untreated and UV-exposed mouse fibroblasts","Epigenetic mechanisms determine the access of regulatory factors to DNA during events such as transcription and the DNA damage response. However, the global response of histone modifications and chromatin accessibility to UV exposure remains poorly understood. Here, we report that UV exposure results in a genome-wide reduction in chromatin accessibility, while the distribution of the active regulatory mark H3K27ac undergoes massive reorganization. Genomic loci subjected to epigenetic reprogramming upon UV exposure represent target sites for sequence-specific transcription factors. Most of these are distal regulatory regions, highlighting their importance in the cellular response to UV exposure. Furthermore, UV exposure results in an extensive reorganization of super-enhancers, accompanied by expression changes of associated genes, which may in part contribute to the stress response. Taken together, our study provides the first comprehensive resource for genome-wide chromatin changes upon UV irradiation in relation to gene expression and elucidates new aspects of this relationship.","['Animals', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession']"
25736311,"Recent studies show that mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) express aberrant miRNA profiles, however, the clinical effect of miRNA expression has not previously been examined and validated in prospective, large, homogenously treated cohorts. We analyzed diagnostic MCL samples from the Nordic MCL2 and MCL3 clinical trials, in which all patients had received Rituximab-high-dose cytarabin alternating with Rituximab-maxiCHOP, followed by BEAM and autologous stem cell support. We performed genome-wide miRNA microarray profiling of 74 diagnostic MCL samples from the MCL2 trial (screening cohort). Differentially expressed miRNAs were re-analyzed by qRT-PCR. Prognostic miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR in diagnostic MCL samples from 94 patients of the independent MCL3 trial (validation cohort).Three miRNAs (miR-18b, miR-92a, miR-378d) were significantly differentially expressed in patients who died from MCL in both the screening- and the validation cohort. MiR-18b was superior to miR-92a and miR-378d in predicting high risk. Thus, we generated a new MIPI-B-miR prognosticator, combining expression-levels of miR-18b with MIPI-B data. This prognosticator improved identification of high risk patients compared to MIPI-B with regard to cause-specific survival (P=0.015), overall survival (P=0.006) and progression-free survival (P<0.001).  Transfection of two MCL cell lines with miR-18b decreased their proliferation rate without inducing apoptosis, suggesting miR-18b may render MCL cells resistant to chemotherapy by decelerating cell proliferation.   Thus, we conclude that overexpression of miR-18b identifies patients with poor prognosis in two large prospective MCL cohorts and adds prognostic information to MIPI-B. MiR-18b may reduce the proliferation rate of MCL cells as a mechanism of chemoresistance.
For miRNA microarray profiling, 500 ng of total RNA from samples  (AM6000) was labeled with Hy3 fluorescent dyes, using the miRCURY LNA array power labeling kit (Exiqon A/S, Vedbæk, Denmark). Samples with RNA concentrations lower than 160 ng/µl were vacuum-centrifuged (speedvac) to obtain higher concentrations. All samples were labeled the same day with the same master mix to minimize technical variation.  The labeled samples were hybridized to miRCURY LNA 7th generation arrays (Manual version 2.2; Exiqon A/S, Vedbæk, Denmark), containing capture probes targeting all human miRNAs registered in  miRBASE release 18.0 (1896 human miRNAs). The hybridization was performed overnight at 56°C according to the manufacturer’s specifications using an HS4800 hybridization station (Tecan, Männendorf, Switzerland). Since it was not possible to hybridize all arrays at the same time point, samples were randomly split into six batches to minimize day-to-day variation in the hybridization process, and analyzed over six consecutive days. After hybridization, the microarray slides were scanned in an ozone free environment in order to prevent potential bleaching of the fluorescent Hy5 dye. Scanning was done using a G2565BA Microarray Scanner system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 10-µm resolution, and the resulting TIFF images were analyzed using the GenePix 6.1 software on standard settings.","Recent studies show that mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) express aberrant microRNA (miRNA) profiles; however, the clinical effect of miRNA expression has not previously been examined and validated in large prospective homogenously treated cohorts.

27866167,"Thermotolerance is a crucial virulence attribute for Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes fatal fungal meningitis in humans. A protein kinase, Sch9, suppresses the thermotolerance of C. neoformans but its regulatory mechanism remains unknown. Here we elucidated the Sch9-dependent and -independent signaling networks for modulating the thermotolerance of C. neoformans through a genome-wide transcriptome analysis and reverse genetics approaches. We found that more than 1,800 genes were under transcriptional control during temperature upshift. Genes encoding for molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins were mainly upregulated, while those for translation, transcription, and sterol biosynthesis were highly suppressed. In this process Sch9 was found to regulate basal or induced expression levels of some temperature-responsive genes. Interestingly we found that Sch9 was involved in transcriptional regulation of the Ire1 kinase, which is a key sensor for the unfolded protein response pathway, and was found to be involved in ER stress response. Most notably, our data demonstrated that expression of HSF1, encoding a heat shock transcription factor 1, was downregulated during temperature upshift and Sch9 suppresses its downregulation. In spite of such expression patterns, Hsf1 was essential for growth and its overexpression indeed promoted the thermotolerance of C. neoformans, suggesting dual roles of Hsf1 in thermotolerance. This idea was supported by additional transcriptome analysis with HSF1 overexpression strain, which revealed that Hsf1 served as both activator and repressor. Hsf1 promoted genes such as Hsp104 and Hsp70 (Ssa1 and Ssa2), both of which were found to be highly upregulated during temperature upshift and required for thermotolerance, while Hsf1 repressed genes involved in oxidative stress and thermotolerance.

Therefore 6 slides of JEC21 (Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans serotype D) 70-mer oligo are used in this analysis, 3 biological replicate experiments are performed, total RNAs are extracted  2 strains from H99 (H99 Wild type strain (Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii serotype A), PH3:HSF1), We use the mixed all of total RNAs from this experiment as a control RNA.

In this process, Sch9 regulated basal expression levels or induced/repressed expression levels of some temperature-responsive genes, including heat shock transcription factor (HSF1) and heat shock proteins (HSP104 and SSA1). Notably, we found that the HSF1 transcript abundance decreased but the Hsf1 protein became transiently phosphorylated during temperature upshift. Nevertheless, Hsf1 is essential for growth and its overexpression promoted C. neoformans thermotolerance. Transcriptome analysis using an HSF1 overexpressing strain revealed a dual role of Hsf1 in the oxidative stress response and thermotolerance. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Hsf1 binds to the step-type like heat shock element (HSE) of its target genes more efficiently than to the perfect- or gap-type HSE.

25486480,"To investigate whether and how expression of the oncogenic transcription factor EVI1 influences gene regulation by phorbol esters and vice versa, the human myeloid cell line U937 was transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control.

U937 cells transduced with an EVI1 expression vector or empty vector as a control were treated with 50 ng/ml TPA or an equivalent amount of ethanol (solvent) for 24 h prior to gene expression microarray analysis. 3 biological replicates were performed.","The product of the ecotropic virus integration site 1 (EVI1) gene, whose overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in myeloid leukemias and some epithelial tumors, regulates gene transcription both through direct DNA binding and through modulation of the activity of other sequence specific transcription factors. Previous results from our laboratory have shown that EVI1 influenced transcription regulation in response to the myeloid differentiation inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in a dual manner: it enhanced ATRA induced transcription of the RARβ gene, but repressed the ATRA induction of the EVI1 gene itself. In the present study, we asked whether EVI1 would modulate the ATRA regulation of a larger number of genes, as well as biological responses to this agent, in human myeloid cells. U937 and HL-60 cells ectopically expressing EVI1 through retroviral transduction were subjected to microarray based gene expression analysis, and to assays measuring cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These experiments showed that EVI1 modulated the ATRA response of several dozens of genes, and in fact reinforced it in the vast majority of cases. A particularly strong synergy between EVI1 and ATRA was observed for GDF15, which codes for a member of the TGF-β superfamily of cytokines. In line with the gene expression results, EVI1 enhanced cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to ATRA, and knockdown of GDF15 counteracted some of these effects. The potential clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 15/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']","['Cell cycle', 'Psiblast checkpoint file', 'Carbon cycle', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'geneseq', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Tree dating']"

Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 9 arrays.
In total 9 arrays.","Chronic exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) has, in certain regions in the world, been strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. AFB1 is a very potent hepatotoxic and carcinogenic mycotoxin which is frequently reported as a food contaminant. Epigenetic modifications provoked by environmental exposures, such as AFB1, may create a persistent epigenetic footprint. Deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has actually been reported in HCC patients following AFB1 exposure; however, no attempts have yet been made to investigate early effects on the epigenome level which may be persistent on longer term, thereby possibly initiating carcinogenic events. In this study, we aim to identify methyl DNA-mRNA-interactions representative for a persistent epigenetic footprint associated with the early onset of AFB1-induced HCC. For this, primary human hepatocytes were exposed to 0.3μM of AFB1 for 5 days. Persistent epigenetic effects were measured 3 days after terminating the carcinogenic exposure. Whole genome DNA methylation changes and whole genome transcriptomic analysis were analyzed applying microarray technologies, and cross-omics interactions were evaluated. Upon combining transcriptomics data with results on DNA methylation, a range of persistent hyper- and hypo-methylated genes was identified which also appeared affected on the transcriptome level. For six of the hypo-methylated and up-regulated genes, namely TXNRD1, PCNA, CCNK, DIAPH3, RAB27A and HIST1H2BF, a clear role in carcinogenic events could be identified.

In this study, we analyzed cases of FL in situ (FLIS) without manifest FL (mFL), partial involvement by FL (PFL) and paired cases of FLIS and mFL to detect possible early chromosomal imbalances, mutations, as well as DNA-methylation patterns of genomic regions of selected genes. We demonstrate that all paired FLIS and mFL cases were clonally related, based on IGH rearrangement patterns and BCL2 breakpoint sequences. FLIS and PFL had no or few secondary chromosomal imbalances detectable by array comparative genomic hybridization (FLIS 0.8 copy number alterations (CNA)/case; PFL 2.0 CNA/case; mFL 6.3 CNA/case) and a lower level of DNA methylation of genes recurrently de novo methylated in lymphomas, as compared with mFL. EZH2 Tyr641 mutations were detected in a subset of both FLIS (2/9) and PFL (1/3) cases. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that FLIS represents a FL precursor lesion of long-lived clonal B cells carrying the t(14;18) with no or few secondary genetic changes.

30286078,"Gene expression array of brain, mandible and maxilla tissues from P0 FoxO6-/- and wildtype mice","The mechanisms that regulate post-natal growth of the craniofacial complex and that ultimately determine the size and shape of our faces are not well understood. Hippo signaling is a general mechanism to control tissue growth and organ size, and although it is known that Hippo signaling functions in neural crest specification and patterning during embryogenesis and before birth, its specific role in postnatal craniofacial growth remains elusive. We have identified the transcription factor FoxO6 as an activator of Hippo signaling regulating neonatal growth of the face. During late stages of mouse development, FoxO6 is expressed specifically in craniofacial tissues and FoxO6-/- mice undergo expansion of the face, frontal cortex, olfactory component and skull. Enlargement of the mandible and maxilla and lengthening of the incisors in FoxO6-/- mice are associated with increases in cell proliferation. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that FoxO6 activates Lats1 expression, thereby increasing Yap phosphorylation and activation of Hippo signaling. FoxO6-/- mice have significantly reduced Hippo Signaling caused by a decrease in Lats1 expression and decreases in Shh and Runx2 expression, suggesting that Shh and Runx2 are also linked to Hippo signaling. In vitro, FoxO6 activates Hippo reporter constructs and regulates cell proliferation. Furthermore PITX2, a regulator of Hippo signaling is associated with Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome causing a flattened midface and we show that PITX2 activates FoxO6 expression. Craniofacial specific expression of FoxO6 postnatally regulates Hippo signaling and cell proliferation. Together, these results identify a FoxO6-Hippo regulatory pathway that controls skull growth, odontogenesis and face morphology.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Maxillofacial Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neural Crest/cytology', 'Organ Size', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skull/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Proteins', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Restriction site creation', 'Word size', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
24516397,miRNA expression profiling in testis of mouse inter-subspecific hybrids,"Hybrid sterility (HS) belongs to reproductive isolation barriers that safeguard the integrity of species in statu nascendi. Although hybrid sterility occurs almost universally among animal and plant species, most of our current knowledge comes from the classical genetic studies on Drosophila interspecific crosses or introgressions. With the house mouse subspecies Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus as a model, new research tools have become available for studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic networks underlying HS. Here we used QTL analysis and intersubspecific chromosome substitution strains to identify a 4.7 Mb critical region on Chromosome X (Chr X) harboring the Hstx2 HS locus, which causes asymmetrical spermatogenic arrest in reciprocal intersubspecific F1 hybrids. Subsequently, we mapped autosomal loci on Chrs 3, 9 and 13 that can abolish this asymmetry. Combination of immunofluorescent visualization of the proteins of synaptonemal complexes with whole-chromosome DNA FISH on pachytene spreads revealed that heterosubspecific, unlike consubspecific, homologous chromosomes are predisposed to asynapsis in F1 hybrid male and female meiosis. The asynapsis is under the trans- control of Hstx2 and Hst1/Prdm9 hybrid sterility genes in pachynemas of male but not female hybrids. The finding concurred with the fertility of intersubpecific F1 hybrid females homozygous for the Hstx2(Mmm) allele and resolved the apparent conflict with the dominance theory of Haldane's rule. We propose that meiotic asynapsis in intersubspecific hybrids is a consequence of cis-acting mismatch between homologous chromosomes modulated by the trans-acting Hstx2 and Prdm9 hybrid male sterility genes.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Pairing/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Loci/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Infertility, Male/*genetics', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'Reproductive Isolation', 'Synaptonemal Complex/genetics', 'X Chromosome/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Data handling', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Phylogenetic continuous quantitative data', 'Isolation report', 'Reproductive health', 'Isolation source', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein-ligand complex']"

26940867,"Mutations such as gene fusion, translocation and focal amplification are a frequent cause of proto-oncogene activation during tumorigenesis, but such mutations do not explain all cases of proto-oncogene activation. Here we show that disruption of local chromosome conformation can also activate proto-oncogenes in human cells. We mapped chromosome structures in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and found that active oncogenes and silent proto-oncogenes generally occur within insulated neighborhoods formed by the looping of two interacting CTCF sites co-occupied by cohesin. Recurrent microdeletions frequently overlap neighborhood boundary sites in T-ALL genomes, and we demonstrate that site-specific perturbation of loop boundaries is sufficient to activate the respective proto-oncogenes in non-malignant cells. We found somatic genomic rearrangements affecting loop boundaries in many cancers. These results suggest that chromosome structural organization is fundamental to identify functional somatic alterations in cancer genomes.

In light of recent evidence that the control of key genes depends on chromosome structures called insulated neighborhoods, we investigated whether proto-oncogenes occur within these structures and whether oncogene activation can occur via disruption of insulated neighborhood boundaries in cancer cells. We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing prominent T-ALL proto-oncogenes. Perturbation of such boundaries in nonmalignant cells was sufficient to activate proto-oncogenes. Mutations affecting chromosome neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant cells.","['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic']","['Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Oncology', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Sequence', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence map', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetic map']"

23619298,"Aneuploidy, oncogene amplification, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition define spontaneous transformation of murine epithelial cells [transcriptome]","Human epithelial cancers are defined by a recurrent distribution of specific chromosomal aneuploidies, a trait less typical for murine cancer models induced by an oncogenic stimulus. After prolonged culture, mouse epithelial cells spontaneously immortalize, transform and become tumorigenic. We assessed genome and transcriptome alterations in cultures derived from bladder and kidney utilizing spectral karyotyping, array CGH, FISH and gene expression profiling. The results show widespread aneuploidy, yet a recurrent and tissue-specific distribution of genomic imbalances, just as in human cancers. Losses of chromosome 4 and gains of chromosome 15 are common and occur early during the transformation process. Global gene expression profiling revealed early and significant transcriptional deregulation. Chromosomal aneuploidy resulted in expression changes of resident genes and consequently in a massive deregulation of the cellular transcriptome. Pathway interrogation of expression changes during the sequential steps of transformation revealed enrichment of genes associated with DNA repair, centrosome regulation, stem cell characteristics and aneuploidy. Genes that modulate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and genes that define the chromosomal instability phenotype played a dominant role and were changed in a directionality consistent with loss of cell adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation. Comparison with gene expression changes during human bladder and kidney tumorigenesis revealed remarkable overlap with changes observed in the spontaneously transformed murine cultures. Therefore, our novel mouse models faithfully recapitulate the sequence of genomic and transcriptomic events that define human tumorigenesis, hence validating them for both basic and preclinical research.","['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Oncogenes', 'Spectral Karyotyping/methods', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Urinary Bladder/cytology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'cel', 'Transition matrix', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Amplification detection', 'Gene classification', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Spectral counting', 'Spectrum', 'Spectral analysis', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Binary format', 'URI', 'Veterinary medicine']"
23873023,Gene expression alterations due to defective Fbw7-dependent cyclin E ubiquitination in bone marrow erythroid cells,"The mechanisms that coordinate the final mitotic divisions of terminally differentiated bone marrow (BM) erythroid cells with components of their structural and functional maturation program remain largely undefined. We previously identified phenotypes resembling those found in early-stage myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including ineffective erythropoiesis, morphologic dysplasia and BM hyper-cellularity, in a knock-in mouse model in which cyclin E mutations were introduced at its two Cdc4 phosphodegrons (CPDs) to ablate Fbw7-dependent ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we have examined the physiologic consequences of cyclin E dysregulation in BM erythroid cells during terminal maturation in vivo. We found that cyclin E protein levels in BM erythroid cells are dynamically regulated in a CPD-dependent manner and that disruption of Fbw7-dependent cyclin E regulation impairs terminal erythroid cell maturation at a discrete stage before enucleation. At this stage of erythroid cell maturation, CPD phosphorylation of cyclin E regulates both cell-cycle arrest and survival. We also found that normal regulation of cyclin E restrains mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and expression of genes that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism during terminal erythroid maturation. In the setting of dysregulated cyclin E expression, p53 is activated in BM erythroid cells as part of a DNA damage response-type pathway, which mitigates ineffective erythropoiesis, in contrast to the role of p53 induction in other models of dyserythropoiesis. Finally, cyclin E dysregulation and ROS accumulation induce histone H3 lysine 9 hyper-methylation and disrupt components of the normal terminal erythroid maturation gene expression program. Thus, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway control of G1-to-S-phase progression is intrinsically linked to regulation of metabolism and gene expression in terminally differentiating BM erythroid cells.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin E/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*physiology', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Cell line name', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'Gene transcript report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Cell line report', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein repeat signature', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Protein contact map', 'Cytometry', 'Protein geometry data', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Mitochondria', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Protein expression', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences']"
26646420,Transcriptome-wide mapping of cut sites of the viral endoribonuclease SOX from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV),"Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread degradation of cellular mRNA. An example of this class of proteins is the mRNA-targeting endoribonuclease SOX from the gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Previous studies indicated that cleavage of messenger RNAs (mRNA) by SOX occurs at specific locations defined by the sequence of the target RNA, which is at odds with the down-regulation of a large portion of cellular transcripts. In this study, we address this paradox by using high-throughput sequencing of cleavage intermediates combined with a custom bioinformatics-based analysis pipeline to identify SOX cleavage sites across the mRNA transcriptome. These data, coupled with targeted mutagenesis, reveal that while cleavage sites are specific and reproducible, they are defined by a degenerate sequence motif containing a small number of conserved residues rather than a strong consensus sequence. This degenerate element is well represented in both human and KSHV mRNA, and its presence correlates with RNA destabilization by SOX. This represents a new endonuclease targeting strategy, in which use of a degenerate targeting element enables RNA cleavage at specific locations without restricting the range of targets. Furthermore, it shows that strong target selectivity can be achieved without a high degree of sequence specificity.","['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*enzymology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Ribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Infectious disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Directory name', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Rare diseases', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
25030422,Identification of miRNAs regulated by TGF-b in human CD8+ T cells,"Cytokine secretion and degranulation represent key components of CD8(+) T-cell cytotoxicity. While transcriptional blockade of IFN-γ and inhibition of degranulation by TGF-β are well established, we wondered whether TGF-β could also induce immune-regulatory miRNAs in human CD8(+) T cells. We used miRNA microarrays and high-throughput sequencing in combination with qRT-PCR and found that TGF-β promotes expression of the miR-23a cluster in human CD8(+) T cells. Likewise, TGF-β up-regulated expression of the cluster in CD8(+) T cells from wild-type mice, but not in cells from mice with tissue-specific expression of a dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor. Reporter gene assays including site mutations confirmed that miR-23a specifically targets the 3'UTR of CD107a/LAMP1 mRNA, whereas the further miRNAs expressed in this cluster-namely, miR-27a and -24-target the 3'UTR of IFN-γ mRNA. Upon modulation of the miR-23a cluster by the respective miRNA antagomirs and mimics, we observed significant changes in IFN-γ expression, but only slight effects on CD107a/LAMP1 expression. Still, overexpression of the cluster attenuated the cytotoxic activity of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These functional data thus reveal that the miR-23a cluster not only is induced by TGF-β, but also exerts a suppressive effect on CD8(+) T-cell effector functions, even in the absence of TGF-β signaling.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1/chemistry/genetics', 'MART-1 Antigen/immunology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA Interference', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism/pharmacology']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein modifications', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Immunology', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Epitope mapping', 'MHC Class I epitopes report', 'MHC Class II epitopes report', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Operon', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Reaction data', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'protein', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'GEN', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'RNA', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

To better understand how risk loci might combine, we examined whether risk-associated genes share regulatory mechanisms. We created a breast cancer gene regulatory network comprising transcription factors and groups of putative target genes (regulons) and asked whether specific regulons are enriched for genes associated with risk loci via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identified 36 overlapping regulons that were enriched for risk loci and formed a distinct cluster within the network, suggesting shared biology. The risk transcription factors driving these regulons are frequently mutated in cancer and lie in two opposing subgroups, which relate to estrogen receptor (ER)(+) luminal A or luminal B and ER(-) basal-like cancers and to different luminal epithelial cell populations in the adult mammary gland.

26416763,Decrease in EZH2 histone methyltransferase mediates the effects of fluid shear stress (FSS) in endothelial cells,"High uniform fluid shear stress (FSS) is atheroprotective and preserves the endothelial phenotype and function through activation of downstream mediators such as MAPK7 (Erk5). Endothelial cells respond to FSS thanks to mechanotransduction. However, how the resulting signaling is integrated and resolved at the epigenetic level remains elusive. We hypothesized that Polycomb methyltransferase EZH2 is involved in the effects of FSS in human endothelial cells. We showed that FSS decreases the expression of the Polycomb methyltransferase EZH2. Despite simultaneous activation of MAPK7, MAPK7 pathway does not directly influence the transcription of EZH2. Interestingly though, the knockdown of EZH2 activates the protective MAPK7 signaling in endothelial cells, even in the absence of FSS. To understand the influence of the FSS-decreased expression of EZH2 on endothelial transcriptome, we performed RNA-seq and differential gene expression analysis. We identified candidate groups of genes dependent on both EZH2 and FSS. Among those, Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis revealed highly significant enrichment of the cell cycle-related genes, suggesting changes in proliferation. Indeed, the depletion of EZH2 strongly inhibited endothelial proliferation, indicating cell cycle arrest. The concomitant decrease in CCNA expression suggests the transition of endothelial cells into a quiescent phenotype. Further bioinformatical analysis suggested TXNIP as a possible mediator between EZH2 and cell cycle-related gene network. Our data show that EZH2 is a FSS-responsive gene. Decreased EZH2 levels enhance the activation of the atheroprotective MAPK7 signaling. Decrease in EZH2 under FSS mediates the decrease in the expression of the network of cell cycle-related genes, which allows the cells to enter quiescence. EZH2 is therefore important for the protective effects of FSS in endothelium.","['Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Rheology', '*Stress, Mechanical']","['Adhesin prediction', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'protein', 'Protein sequence', 'Sequence cluster (protein)', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Helical net', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Kinase name', 'Protein active sites', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Biology', 'Ecology', 'Ontology and terminology']"

We have previously demonstrated significant micro-environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR) to ATO in APL. Here we demonstrate that this EMDR could be effectively overcome by combining a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) with ATO. A synergistic effect on combining these two agents in vitro was noted in both ATO-sensitive and ATO-resistant APL cell lines. The mechanism of this synergy involved downregulation of the nuclear factor-κB pathway, increase in unfolded protein response (UPR) and an increase in reactive oxygen species generation in the malignant cell. We also noted that PML-RARA oncoprotein is effectively cleared with this combination in spite of proteasome inhibition by bortezomib, and that this clearance is mediated through a p62-dependent autophagy pathway.

The beneficial effect of this combination was further validated in an animal model and in an on-going clinical trial.

26871295,"The purpose of this study was to identify de-regulated miRNAs in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). To this aim miRNA expression profiles of PTCs and normal thyroid samples were compared. Tissue specimens were selected  by an expert pathologist. Details about the histological type of tumor samples are provided.
miRNA expression profiles for 19 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas and 5 normal thyroids were generated using Agilent microarray platform.","Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) is the most frequent thyroid cancer. Although several PTC-specific miRNA profiles have been reported, only few upregulated miRNAs are broadly recognized, while less consistent data are available about downregulated miRNAs. In this study we investigated miRNA deregulation in PTC by miRNA microarray, analysis of a public dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), literature review and meta-analysis based on a univocal miRNA identifier derived from miRBase v21. A list of 18 miRNAs differentially expressed between PTC and normal thyroid was identified and validated in the TCGA dataset. Furthermore, we compared our signature with miRNA profiles derived from 15 studies selected from literature. Then, to select possibly functionally relevant miRNA, we integrated our miRNA signature with those from two in vitro cell models based on the PTC-driving oncogene RET/PTC1. Through this strategy, we identified commonly deregulated miRNAs, including miR-451a, which emerged also by our meta-analysis as the most frequently reported downregulated miRNA. We showed that lower expression of miR-451a correlates with aggressive clinical-pathological features of PTC as tall cell variant, advanced stage and extrathyroid extension. In addition, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-451a impairs proliferation and migration of two PTC-derived cell lines, reduces the protein levels of its recognized targets MIF, c-MYC and AKT1 and attenuates AKT/mTOR pathway activation.Overall, our study provide both an updated overview of miRNA deregulation in PTC and the first functional evidence that miR-451a exerts tumor suppressor functions in this neoplasia.","['Carcinoma, Papillary/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']","['Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Kinase name', 'Cancer type', 'Oncology', 'Plasmid map']"
29661252,"Activating mutation of KIT is well known as a key molecular event for the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors(GISTs). Dysregulation of microRNAs(miRNA) might elucidate KIT mutation, KIT overexpression and the resulting tumorigenesis in GIST. Herein we identified miRNA expression profiles that associated with KIT mutation and KIT overexpression in GIST by  miRNA microarrays and Real-time PCR in GISTs. The potentially target genes of selected miRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatic techniques with GO and KEGG pathway analysis. We showed that 6 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CD117IHC+/KITmutant GISTs compared to CD117IHC-/wild-type GISTs. Of these, 2 miRNAs including miR-483-3p and miR-589 were up-regulated, while the other 4 miRNAs including miR-140-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-1587 and miR-4507 were down-regulated. GO and KEGG analysis demonstrated that miRNAs with significant change were involved in regulation of target genes related to the development of GIST. Among the candidate miRNAs studied, miR-148b-3p and miR-140-5p may be involved in GIST tumorigenesis via targeting mutant KIT or via intermediate molecules of PDGFRA, PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathway, such as AKT2, MAPK1, MAPK10, STAT5A, SMAD4, SMAD5 and PTEN. Furthermore, the reduced expression of miR-140-5p and miR-148b-3p were inversely correlated with high-risk grade, recurrence and metastasis of GIST. The current findings indicated that miR-148b-3p and miR-140-5p were not only involved in tumorigenesis of GIST, but might also participate in the progression of GIST and could be considered as novel biomarkers for potentially predicting the prognosis of GIST.
We elected this study to investigate miRNAs expression signatures which respect to KIT mutation and KIT overexpression of GISTs by conducting miRNA expression profiles in 5 CD117IHC+/KITmutant GISTs and 5 CD117IHC-/wild-type GISTs. The selected candidate miRNAs were subsequently validated in a cohort of 59 GIST patients including of 45 CD117IHC+/KITmutant GISTs and 14 CD117IHC-/wild-type GISTs.",Gain-of-function mutations and overexpression of KIT are characteristic features of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

26336159,Role of TBC1D4 in mouse kidneys: Identification of compensatory mechanisms in the DCT of TBC1D4-deficient mice,"The Rab GTPase-activating protein TBC1D4 (AS160) controls trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells. TBC1D4 is also highly abundant in the renal distal tubule, although its role in this tubule is so far unknown. In vitro studies suggest that it is involved in the regulation of renal transporters and channels such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), aquaporin-2 (AQP2), and the Na+-K+-ATPase. To assess the physiological role of TBC1D4 in the kidney, wild-type (TBC1D4+/+) and TBC1D4-deficient (TBC1D4-/-) mice were studied. Unexpectedly, neither under standard nor under challenging conditions (low Na+/high K+, water restriction) did TBC1D4-/- mice show any difference in urinary Na+ and K+ excretion, urine osmolarity, plasma ion and aldosterone levels, and blood pressure compared with TBC1D4+/+ mice. Also, immunoblotting did not reveal any change in the abundance of major renal sodium- and water-transporting proteins [Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) NKCC2, NaCl cotransporter (NCC), ENaC, AQP2, and the Na+-K+-ATPase]. However, the abundance of GLUT4, which colocalizes with TBC1D4 along the distal nephron of TBC1D4+/+ mice, was lower in whole kidney lysates of TBC1D4-/- mice than in TBC1D4+/+ mice. Likewise, primary thick ascending limb (TAL) cells isolated from TBC1D4-/- mice showed an increased basal glucose uptake and an abrogated insulin response compared with TAL cells from TBC1D4+/+ mice. Thus, TBC1D4 is dispensable for the regulation of renal Na+ and water transport, but may play a role for GLUT4-mediated basolateral glucose uptake in distal tubules. The latter may contribute to the known anaerobic glycolytic capacity of distal tubules during renal ischemia.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Kidney/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Distal/metabolism', 'Loop of Henle/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Parvalbumins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Sodium/*metabolism', '*Water-Electrolyte Balance']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein active sites', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Type', 'Transposon prediction', 'Map type', 'Protein alignment', 'Loop modelling', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Phenotype name', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Immunogenetics', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Electron density map']"
27398909,RNA sequencing of mechanically strained NHEKs and control NHEKs,"Tissue mechanics drive morphogenesis, but how forces are sensed and transmitted to control stem cell fate and self-organization remains unclear. We show that a mechanosensory complex of emerin (Emd), non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and actin controls gene silencing and chromatin compaction, thereby regulating lineage commitment. Force-driven enrichment of Emd at the outer nuclear membrane of epidermal stem cells leads to defective heterochromatin anchoring to the nuclear lamina and a switch from H3K9me2,3 to H3K27me3 occupancy at constitutive heterochromatin. Emd enrichment is accompanied by the recruitment of NMIIA to promote local actin polymerization that reduces nuclear actin levels, resulting in attenuation of transcription and subsequent accumulation of H3K27me3 at facultative heterochromatin. Perturbing this mechanosensory pathway by deleting NMIIA in mouse epidermis leads to attenuated H3K27me3-mediated silencing and precocious lineage commitment, abrogating morphogenesis. Our results reveal how mechanics integrate nuclear architecture and chromatin organization to control lineage commitment and tissue morphogenesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/*physiology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/deficiency', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Gene ID', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Histogram', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'HET group name', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"

26374119,Cell-specific microRNA expression patterns in TB patients and household contacts,"An estimated one-third of the world's population is currently latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) progresses into active tuberculosis (TB) disease in ~5 to 10% of infected individuals. Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to monitor disease progression are urgently needed to ensure better care for TB patients and to decrease the spread of TB. Biomarker development is primarily based on transcriptomics. Our understanding of biology combined with evolving technical advances in high-throughput techniques led us to investigate the possibility of additional platforms (epigenetics and proteomics) in the quest to (i) understand the biology of the TB host response and (ii) search for multiplatform biosignatures in TB. We engaged in a pilot study to interrogate the DNA methylome, transcriptome, and proteome in selected monocytes and granulocytes from TB patients and healthy LTBI participants. Our study provides first insights into the levels and sources of diversity in the epigenome and proteome among TB patients and LTBI controls, despite limitations due to small sample size. Functionally the differences between the infection phenotypes (LTBI versus active TB) observed in the different platforms were congruent, thereby suggesting regulation of function not only at the transcriptional level but also by DNA methylation and microRNA. Thus, our data argue for the development of a large-scale study of the DNA methylome, with particular attention to study design in accounting for variation based on gender, age, and cell type.","['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*growth & development', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tuberculosis/*pathology']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Feature extraction', 'NCBI Genome Project ID', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA']"
24443471,MITF ChIP-seq in primary melanocyte and melanoma as a function of oncogenic BRAF,"Thousands of putative enhancers are characterized in the human genome, yet few have been shown to have a functional role in cancer progression. Inhibiting oncokinases, such as EGFR, ALK, ERBB2, and BRAF, is a mainstay of current cancer therapy but is hindered by innate drug resistance mediated by up-regulation of the HGF receptor, MET. The mechanisms mediating such genomic responses to targeted therapy are unknown. Here, we identify lineage-specific enhancers at the MET locus for multiple common tumor types, including a melanoma lineage-specific enhancer 63 kb downstream from the MET TSS. This enhancer displays inducible chromatin looping with the MET promoter to up-regulate MET expression upon BRAF inhibition. Epigenomic analysis demonstrated that the melanocyte-specific transcription factor, MITF, mediates this enhancer function. Targeted genomic deletion (<7 bp) of the MITF motif within the MET enhancer suppressed inducible chromatin looping and innate drug resistance, while maintaining MITF-dependent, inhibitor-induced melanoma cell differentiation. Epigenomic analysis can thus guide functional disruption of regulatory DNA to decouple pro- and anti-oncogenic functions of a dominant transcription factor and block innate resistance to oncokinase therapy.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transcriptome', 'Vemurafenib']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Molecules', 'ELAND format', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Kinase name', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', '.nib']"
15937132,Zea mays Map,"Bioinformatic analyses of maize EST sequences have highlighted large numbers of candidate genes putatively involved in agriculturally important traits. To contribute to ongoing efforts toward mapping of these genes, we used two populations of intermated recombinant inbred lines (IRILs), which allow a higher map resolution than nonintermated RILs. The first panel (IBM), derived from B73 x Mo17, is publicly available from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center. The second panel (LHRF) was developed from F2 x F252 to map loci monomorphic on IBM. We built framework maps of 237 loci from the IBM panel and 271 loci from the LHRF panel. Both maps were used to place 1454 loci (1056 on map IBM_Gnp2004 and 398 on map LHRF_Gnp2004) that corresponded to 954 cDNA probes previously unmapped. RFLP was mostly used, but PCR-based methods were also performed for some cDNAs to map SNPs. Unlike in usual IRIL-based maps published so far, corrected meiotic centimorgan distances were calculated, taking into account the number of intermating generations undergone by the IRILs. The corrected sizes of our framework maps were 1825 cM for IBM_Gnp2004 and 1862 cM for LHRF_Gnp2004.

The majority of Cockayne syndrome cases contain mutations in the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CSB; however, how CSB protects cells from oxidative stress remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that oxidative stress alters the genomic occupancy of the CSB protein and increases CSB occupancy at promoters. Additionally, we found that the long-range chromatin-structure regulator CTCF plays a pivotal role in regulating sites of genomic CSB occupancy upon oxidative stress. We show that CSB directly interacts with CTCF in vitro and that oxidative stress enhances the CSB-CTCF interaction in cells. Reciprocally, we demonstrate that CSB facilitates CTCF-DNA interactions in vitro and regulates CTCF-chromatin interactions in oxidatively stressed cells. Together, our results indicate that CSB and CTCF can regulate each other's chromatin association, thereby modulating chromatin structure and coordinating gene expression in response to oxidative stress.","['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'DNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vitamin K 3/pharmacology']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Helical net', 'Helical wheel', 'Enzymes', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme report', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'IDAT', 'Proteins', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'protein', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein report', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
24787348,Allele specific timing of replication,"We have developed a new approach to characterize allele-specific timing of DNA replication genome-wide in human primary basophilic erythroblasts. We show that the two chromosome homologs replicate at the same time in about 88% of the genome and that large structural variants are preferentially associated with asynchronous replication. We identified about 600 megabase-sized asynchronously replicated domains in two tested individuals. The longest asynchronously replicated domains are enriched in imprinted genes suggesting that structural variants and parental imprinting are two causes of replication asynchrony in the human genome. Biased chromosome X inactivation in one of the two individuals tested was another source of detectable replication asynchrony. Analysis of high-resolution TimEX profiles revealed small variations termed timing ripples, which were undetected in previous, lower resolution analyses. Timing ripples reflect highly reproducible, variations of the timing of replication in the 100 kb-range that exist within the well-characterized megabase-sized replication timing domains. These ripples correspond to clusters of origins of replication that we detected using novel nascent strands DNA profiling methods. Analysis of the distribution of replication origins revealed dramatic differences in initiation of replication frequencies during S phase and a strong association, in both synchronous and asynchronous regions, between origins of replication and three genomic features: G-quadruplexes, CpG Islands and transcription start sites. The frequency of initiation in asynchronous regions was similar in the two homologs. Asynchronous regions were richer in origins of replication than synchronous regions.","['*Alleles', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genome, Human', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'X Chromosome Inactivation']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Small molecules', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Human biology', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Annotation track', 'Human disease', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report']"
28502771,"The goal of this study is to characterize the human immune responses to the live attenuated Herpes zoster vaccine Zostavax, to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to antibody production and T cell induction, and to understand the difference between young and elderly healthy adults. The overall data collection included antigen specific assays, flow cytometric profiling of innate and adaptive cell populations, measurement of serum cytokines, and transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures. Zostavax induced robust antigen-specific antibody responses, and significant T cell responses. A number of gene pathways were upregulated after vaccination. Using our previously developed blood transcription modules, we also identified transcriptomic correlates to antibody response. Furthermore, this study revealed strong association between PBMC transcriptomics and plasma metabolomics. Integrative analysis of orthogonal datasets from metabolomics, transcriptomic and immune profiling facilitated a temporal reconstruction of Zostavax induced biological networks culminating in antibody responses , and the delineation of novel molecular correlates of vaccine immunity.
A longitudinal study of Zostavax® vaccination was conducted on healthy adults, between August 2011 and November 2013.  Seventy-seven people were enrolled at Atlanta, Georgia and Denver, Colorado, USA. The cohort contained two age groups: 33 subjects considered to be young adults between the age of 25~40, and 44 subjects as elderly between the age of 60~79 years . The subject’s blood was collected at baseline, days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 post-vaccination. Throughout the course of study, we measured Zostavax specific antibody titers, B and T cell populations, as well as various cell populations involved in innate immunity, including dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subsets. Cytokines were assayed by a 27-plex Luminex platform. Varicella zoster viremia was measured by real-time PCR and nested PCR reactions. We profiled transcriptomics of PBMCs, and high-resolution mass spectrometers to obtain metabolomics of plasma from subjects at baseline and on days 1-7 post-vaccination.","Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells yet limited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.","['Adaptive Immunity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Antibody Formation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Herpes Zoster Vaccine/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Metabolomics', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sterols/metabolism', 'Viral Load']","['DNA barcoding', 'Peptide immunogenicity data', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Epitope mapping', 'HPA antibody id', 'Format', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Cytometry', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'DNA vaccine design', 'Vaccinology', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Animal study', 'MAT', 'Metabolomics', 'Metagenomics', 'Metabolites', 'Ancestral reconstruction', 'Phylogenetic character data', 'Sequence mask character', 'Parsing']"

27920338,"Organ formation in animals and plants relies on precise control of cell state transitions to turn stem cell daughters into fully differentiated cells. In plants, cells cannot rearrange due to shared cell walls. Thus, differentiation progression and the accompanying cell expansion must be tightly coordinated. PLETHORA (PLT) transcription factor gradients were shown to guide the progression of cell differentiation at different positions in the Arabidopsis root. While well-described transcription factor gradients in animals specify distinct cell fates within an essentially static context, the PLT gradient is unique in its ability to control cell differentiation in a growing organ during continuous production and expansion of cells. To understand the output of these gradients we studied the gene set transcriptionally controlled by PLTs. Our work reveals how the PLT gradient regulates cell state by region-specific induction of cell proliferation genes and repression of differentiation. Moreover, PLT targets include major patterning genes and autoregulatory feedback components, reinforcing their role as master regulators of organ development.

27868332,"Maggot ES is known to induce wound healing in vivo to improve chronic wound repair. The effects have been studies at the protein and molecular level but never before at the transcriptional level.Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify the genes modulated by maggot ES and link these to gene pathways to understand the molecular effects on cells.
Cells were plated in 6 well plates overnight before treating with 8µg/mL ES or an equal volume of carrier buffer PBS for 48 hours. Treatments were performed in three biological replicate. After the treatment time total RNA was isolated.","Maggots, through their excretions and secretions (ES), promote wound healing by removing necrotic tissue, counter bacterial infection, and activate wound associated cells. We investigated the effects of a physiological dose of maggot ES on four wound-associated cell types in vitro with Affymetrix gene expression arrays; keratinocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and monocytes. Keratinocytes showed the fewest (n = 5; p < 0.05, fold-change ±2) and smallest fold-changes (up to 2.32×) in gene expression and conversely THP1 monocytes had the most (n = 233) and greatest magnitude (up to 44.3×). There were no genes that were altered in all four cell-lines. Gene pathway analysis identified an enrichment of immune response pathways in three of the treated cell-lines. Analyses by quantitative RT-PCR found many genes dynamically expressed in ES dose dependent manner during the three day treatments. Phenotype analyses, however, found no effects of ES on cell viability, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. ES was 100× less potent at triggering IL-8 secretion than fibroblasts treated with purified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; in equivalent amounts to that found in ES; ∼40 EU/ml). Furthermore, co-treatment with LPS and ES decreased the LPS-alone triggered IL-8 secretion by 13%. Although ES had no direct effect on wound cell phenotypes it did partially reduce the immune response to bacterial LPS exposure. These observations were consistent with the profile of transcriptional responses that were dominated by modulation of immune response genes. Maggot therapy may therefore improve wound healing through the secondary effects of these gene changes in the wound cells.","['Animals', 'Bodily Secretions/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Diptera', 'Endothelial Cells/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Keratinocytes/*physiology', 'Larva/*metabolism/physiology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Wound Healing/*genetics/immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'DIP ID', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Generation', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Medical informatics', 'Compound identifier']"

3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays","ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is an essential checkpoint kinase that signals DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Its depletion causes meiotic and somatic defects in Arabidopsis and progressive motor impairment accompanied by several cell deficiencies in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). To obtain a comprehensive view of the ATM pathway in plants, we performed a time-course analysis of seedling responses by combining confocal laser scanning microscopy studies of root development and genome-wide expression profiling of wild-type (WT) and homozygous ATM-deficient mutants challenged with a dose of gamma-rays (IR) that is sublethal for WT plants. Early morphologic defects in meristematic stem cells indicated that AtATM, an Arabidopsis homolog of the human ATM gene, is essential for maintaining the quiescent center and controlling the differentiation of initial cells after exposure to IR. Results of several microarray experiments performed with whole seedlings and roots up to 5 h post-IR were compiled in a single table, which was used to import gene information and extract gene sets. Sequence and function homology searches; import of spatio-temporal, cell cycling, and mutant-constitutive expression characteristics; and a simplified functional classification system were used to identify novel genes in all functional classes. The hundreds of radiomodulated genes identified were not a random collection, but belonged to functional pathways such as those of the cell cycle; cell death and repair; DNA replication, repair, and recombination; and transcription; translation; and signaling, indicating the strong cell reprogramming and double-strand break abrogation functions of ATM checkpoints. Accordingly, genes in all functional classes were either down or up-regulated concomitantly with downregulation of chromatin deacetylases or upregulation of acetylases and methylases, respectively. Determining the early transcriptional indicators of prolonged S-G2 phases that coincided with cell proliferation delay, or an anticipated subsequent auxin increase, accelerated cell differentiation or death, was used to link IR-regulated hallmark functions and tissue phenotypes after IR. The transcription burst was almost exclusively AtATM-dependent or weakly AtATR-dependent, and followed two major trends of expression in atm: (i)-loss or severe attenuation and delay, and (ii)-inverse and/or stochastic, as well as specific, enabling one to distinguish IR/ATM pathway constituents. Our data provide a large resource for studies on the interaction between plant checkpoints of the cell cycle, development, hormone response, and DNA repair functions, because IR-induced transcriptional changes partially overlap with the response to environmental stress. Putative connections of ATM to stem cell maintenance pathways after IR are also discussed.","['Arabidopsis/genetics/growth & development/*radiation effects', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/*physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', '*Gamma Rays', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Microarray experiment', 'Microarrays', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
27997543,"Heritable DNA methylation imprints occur in most genomes and underlie genetic variability in humans. The mechanism and consequences of establishing and propagating local hypomethylation through consecutive rounds of DNA replication and intermittent cell division cycles are poorly understood. Our genome-wide and site-specific methyl-N6-adenine (m6A-) analyses reveal a conserved local hypomethylation mechanism in two α-proteobacterial model systems. We show that MucR, a DNA-binding protein that uses an ancestral zinc-finger fold to control expression of virulence and cell cycle genes, competes with the cell cycle-regulated adenine-methyltransferase CcrM for target sites in S-phase, but not in G1-phase. Constitutive expression of CcrM or heterologous methylases during the cell cycle homogenizes m6A patterns even when MucR is present and controls transcription. We also find that environmental responses can impose methylation remodelling at certain sites, while the conserved cell cycle circuitry imposes systemic constraints on when local hypomethylation is instated.

In microbial genomes, DNA methylation has been implicated in gene transcription, DNA replication and repair, nucleoid segregation, transposition and virulence of pathogenic strains. Despite the importance of local (hypo)methylation at specific loci, how and when these patterns are established during the cell cycle remains poorly characterized. Taking advantage of the small genomes and the synchronizability of α-proteobacteria, we discovered that conserved determinants of the cell cycle transcriptional circuitry establish specific hypomethylation patterns in the cell cycle model system Caulobacter crescentus. We used genome-wide methyl-N6-adenine (m6A-) analyses by restriction-enzyme-cleavage sequencing (REC-Seq) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to show that MucR, a transcriptional regulator that represses virulence and cell cycle genes in S-phase but no longer in G1-phase, occludes 5'-GANTC-3' sequence motifs that are methylated by the DNA adenine methyltransferase CcrM. Constitutive expression of CcrM or heterologous methylases in at least two different α-proteobacteria homogenizes m6A patterns even when MucR is present and affects promoter activity.

EBs were induced with Tamoxifen at day 4 and harvested at day 7.
Investigate differentially expressed genes in control and Trim33-deficient embryoid bodies derived from mouse embryonic stem cells","Congenital cardiac malformations are among the most common birth defects in humans. Here we show that Trim33, a member of the Tif1 subfamily of tripartite domain containing transcriptional cofactors, is required for appropriate differentiation of the pre-cardiogenic mesoderm during a narrow time window in late gastrulation. While mesoderm-specific Trim33 mutants did not display noticeable phenotypes, epiblast-specific Trim33 mutant embryos developed ventricular septal defects, showed sparse trabeculation and abnormally thin compact myocardium, and died as a result of cardiac failure during late gestation. Differentiating embryoid bodies deficient in Trim33 showed an enrichment of gene sets associated with cardiac differentiation and contractility, while the total number of cardiac precursor cells was reduced. Concordantly, cardiac progenitor cell proliferation was reduced in Trim33-deficient embryos. ChIP-Seq performed using antibodies against Trim33 in differentiating embryoid bodies revealed more than 4000 peaks, which were significantly enriched close to genes implicated in stem cell maintenance and mesoderm development. Nearly half of the Trim33 peaks overlapped with binding sites of the Ctcf insulator protein. Our results suggest that Trim33 is required for appropriate differentiation of precardiogenic mesoderm during late gastrulation and that it will likely mediate some of its functions via multi-protein complexes, many of which include the chromatin architectural and insulator protein Ctcf.","['Animals', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*embryology', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/metabolism', '*Gastrulation', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Calculation', 'Simulation', 'Gene regulation', 'Keyword', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

25451979,Affymetrix gene chip analysis for the whole mouse genome transcripts of epithelial and stromal cells from mouse uterine primary co-culture treated with either vehicle or E2,"To define endometrial stromal-derived paracrine mediators that participate in estradiol-17β (E2)-induced epithelial proliferation, microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out in mouse uterine epithelial-stromal co-culture systems under the condition of E2 or vehicle (control). Our results demonstrated gene alteration by E2: in epithelial cells, we found up-regulation of 119 genes and down-regulation of 28 genes, while in stroma cells we found up-regulation of 144 genes and down-regulation of 184 genes. A functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated epithelial genes implicated them for proliferation, while upregulated stromal genes were associated with extracellular functions. Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization results confirmed differential gene expression in both cell cultures and ovariectomized uteri after the above treatments. Based on our identification of stromal secretory factors, we found evidence that suppression by siRNA specifically for Bmp8a and/or Fgf10 in the stromal layer caused significant inhibition of proliferation by E2 in the co-culture system, suggesting Bmp8a and Fgf10 act as paracrine mediators during E2-dependent control of uterine proliferation. The localization of receptors and receptor activation signaling in epithelial cells in both the co-culture system and uteri was consistent with their involvement in ligand-receptor signaling. Interestingly, loss of Bmp8a or Fgf10 also caused abrogation of E2-regulated epithelial receptor signaling in co-culture systems, suggesting that stroma-derived Fgf10 and Bmp8a are responsible for epithelial communication. Overall, stromal Fgf10 and Bmp8a serve as potential paracrine factors for E2-dependent regulation of epithelial proliferation in the uterus.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 10/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Ovariectomy', 'Paracrine Communication/*genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Pseudopregnancy/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Uterus/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Anatomy', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Locus ID (PseudoCAP)', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Virus identifier']"

ATP level, miRNA and mRNA microarray expression profiles during C2C12 differentiation into myotubes were assessed.

Among these, miR-423-3p showed a high inverse correlation with increasing ATP levels. Besides having implications in promoting cell growth and cell cycle progression, its function in cellular ATP regulation is yet unknown. Therefore, miR-423-3p was selected and validated for the function together with its potential target, Cox6a2. Overexpression of miR-423-3p in C2C12 myogenic differentiation lead to decreased cellular ATP level and decreased expression of Cox6a2 compared to the negative control.

Regardless of their transcriptional activities, CGI+ genes are mainly located at the nuclear center and encounter frequent long-range chromosomal interactions. Meanwhile, nuclear peripheral CGI- genes forming heterochromatin are activated and internalized into the nuclear center by local enhancer-promoter interactions.

Zinc is indispensable for the catalytic activity and structural stability of many proteins, and its deficiency can have severe consequences for microbial growth in natural and industrial environments. For example, Zn depletion in wort negatively affects beer fermentation and quality. Several studies have investigated yeast adaptation to low Zn supply, but were all performed in batch cultures, where specific growth rate depends on Zn availability. The transcriptional responses to growth-rate and Zn availability are then intertwined, which obscures result interpretation.

28611032,"Very little information is available about non-coding(nc)RNAs and their role in regulating tissue responses in myocardial ischemia and acute infarction. We measured for the first time nascent RNA transcription of protein coding genes, primary(pri)-miRNAs, long non-coding(lnc)RNAs and enhancer(e)RNAs in healthy myocardium, border zone to ischemia and infarction area in pig hearts using GRO-seq. The gene expression analysis indicated a gradient of induction of inflammatory mediators, and repression of PPAR-signaling and oxidative phosphorylation. An exception to rule was A1 adenosine receptor, which exhibited induced gene expression in the border zone, where it might increase myocardial resistance to ischemia, but repression in the ischemic zone. In addition, we interrogated for the first time the transcriptional regulation of pri-miRs and provide evidence that several arrhythmia-related target genes are further repressed at post-transcriptional level. We identified 450 lncRNAs which were differently regulated by ischemia including novel lncRNAs expressed in antisense orientation to major myocardial transcription factors GATA4, GATA6 and KLF6. Finally, characterization of enhancers exhibiting differential expression of eRNAs, pointed a central role for KLF, MEF2C, ETS, NFY, ATF, E2F2 and NRF1 transcription factors in determining tissue-specific responses to ischemic insult. In conclusion, GRO-Seq allowed us to follow the gradient of gene expression occurring in the ischemic heart and identify novel ncRNAs regulated by oxygen deprivation. These findings have identified potential new targets for diagnosis and treatment of myocardial ischemia based on acute changes in eRNA, lncRNA and miRNA expression in the affected heart.

27935859,"Various types of HDAC inhibitor are now planned or on going to use against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma including CTCL. However there is a lack of molecular based evidence not only for which HDACi might be effective to use against advanced CTCL but also for which genes might be pivotal target gene(s) of HDACi. To investigate expression changes of miRNAs by HDACis, we conducted miRNA microarray by using CTCL cell lines.
CTCL cell lines (My-La, HH, HUT78) and  CD4+ T-cells of healthy controls were treated with SAHA (5 µM),  panobinostat (80 nM), or DMSO for 24hrs. After treatment, total RNA was extracted from cells, and miRNA microarray analysis was performed.","Tumor suppressive microRNA (miR)-150 inhibits metastasis by combining with the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) ""seed sequence"" mRNA of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Panobinostat', 'Receptors, CCR6/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'DNA testing', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Nucleic acids', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Informatics', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Multiomics', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Retention time prediction', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"

We isolated pure populations of cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from a genetically engineered mouse model of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to investigate the mechanisms that drive the metastatic spread of this lethal cancer. Genome-wide characterization of chromatin accessibility revealed the opening of large numbers of distal regulatory elements across the genome during metastatic progression. These changes correlate with copy number amplification of the Nfib locus, and differentially accessible sites were highly enriched for Nfib transcription factor binding sites. Nfib is necessary and sufficient to increase chromatin accessibility at a large subset of the intergenic regions. Nfib promotes pro-metastatic neuronal gene expression programs and drives the metastatic ability of SCLC cells.

A low frequency of somatic mutations, but frequent epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation in HGSOC tumors, presents the cancer epigenome as a relevant target for innovative therapy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) supposedly are good preclinical models for identifying novel drug targets. However, the representativeness of global methylation status of HGSOC PDXs compared to their original tumors has not been evaluated. Aims of this study were to explore how representative HGSOC PDXs are for their corresponding patient tumors methylome and to evaluate the effect of epigenetic therapy and cisplatin on putative epigenetically regulated genes and their related pathways in PDXs.Methods: Genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome of HGSOC patients with their corresponding PDXs, from different generations, was performed using Infinium 450K. Further, we analyzed global methylome changes after treatment of HGSOC PDXs with the FDA approved demethylating agent decitabine and cisplatin. Findings were validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing with subsequent pathway analysis. Publicly available datasets comprising HGSOC patients were used to analyze the predictive/prognostic value of the identified genes.Results: Only 0.6-1.0% of all analyzed CpGs (388,696 CpGs) changed significantly (p<0.01) during propagation showing that HGSOC PDXs are epigenetically stable. Treatment of F3 PDXs with decitabine caused a significant reduction in methylation in 10.6% of CpG sites in comparison to untreated PDXs (p<0.01, FDR<10%). Cisplatin treatment had a marginal effect on the PDX methylome. Pathway analysis of decitabine-treated PDX tumors revealed several putative epigenetically regulated pathways (e.g. Src family kinase pathway). Particularly, C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) gene was successfully validated for epigenetic regulation in different PDX models and ovarian cancer cell lines. Low CSK methylation and high CSK expression were both significantly associated (p<0.05) with improved progression free survival and overall survival in HGSOC patients.Conclusion: HGSOC PDXs resemble the global epigenome of patients over many generations, which can be modulated by epigenetic drugs. Novel epigenetically regulated genes such as CSK and related pathways were identified in HGSOC. Our results encourage future application of PDXs for cancer epigenome studies.
DNA was isolated from frozen tumors of three different ovarian PDXs models up to 3 generations (F0, F1, F2 and F3) (n=12), one PDX model with treatment of vehicle, cisplatin and Decitabine (DAC) with 3 mice in each group and SKOV3 cell line with and without DAC treatment.

Here we report that VGLL4, a previously identified YAP antagonist, also functions as a regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. The expression of VGLL4 is significantly downregulated in clinical colorectal carcinoma (CRC) specimens, positively associated with patient survival rate, and inversely correlated with the expression of Wnt target genes in CRCs. Knockdown of VGLL4 enhances proliferation and tumour formation of CRC cells. A designed peptide mimicking the function of VGLL4 effectively inhibits CRC progression in a de novo mouse model. Mechanistically, TEAD4 associates with TCF4 to form a complex and cobind target genes. VGLL4 targets this TEAD4-TCF4 complex to interfere the functional interplay between TEAD4 and TCF4, suppressing the transactivation of TCF4. Collectively, our study indicates that Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo-YAP signalling are directly linked at transcription factor-level, and VGLL4 can target a TEAD4-TCF4 complex to co-regulate both pathways.","['Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein/genetics', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'TEA Domain Transcription Factors', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcription Factor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence composition', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Color', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'R markdown', 'cel', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Annotation track', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Date', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Analysis', 'Matrix', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"

28273453,"CD95 was found to be important for both the formation of CSCs and their maintenance.  Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis  we have now identified STAT1 as a critical gene that mediates the CSC-driving activity of CD95.  We report that chronic stimulation of CD95 by either agonist antibodies, soluble CD95L or stably  expressed membrane CD95L causes both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and activation  of STAT1 regulated genes. The genes most significantly induced were part of an interferon (IFN)-related  DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) recently identified in a radiation resistant squamous cell  carcinoma cell line Nu61 when compared to parental SCC61 cells. The IRDS was found to strongly correlate with therapy resistance (chemotherapy and radiation) in multiple cancer cells as well as in 5 human  primary cancers. We now report that CD95 stimulation of breast cancer cell lines or the SCC61 cells induces  the upregulation of Type I IFNs that bind to both Type I receptors IFNAR1 and IFNR2 resulting in activation  of JAK kinases, activation of STAT1 and induction of a number of STAT1-regulated genes. This process can be  inhibited by active caspases. Consequently, we identified Type I IFNs as drivers of cancer stemness.  Knockdown of STAT1 using either siRNAs or shRNAs, or deleting two independent sites in the STAT1 gene in MCF-7  cells using the CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing system resulted in a loss of the ability of CD95 to increase stemness.

CD95 stimulation of cancer cells induced secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) that bind to type I IFN receptors, resulting in activation of Janus-activated kinases, activation of STAT1, and induction of a number of STAT1-regulated genes that are part of a gene signature recently linked to therapy resistance in five primary human cancers. Consequently, we identified type I IFNs as drivers of cancer stemness. Knockdown or knockout of STAT1 resulted in a strongly reduced ability of CD95L or type I IFN to increase cancer stemness.

32358519,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent small noncoding RNAs that are involved in physiologic and developmental processes by negatively regulating expression of target genes. They exist as individual miRNA genes or as polycistronically transcribed gene clusters. The largest miRNA cluster in mice is located in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene, and contains 72 miRNA precursor sequences within approximately 50 kb. Although this miRNA cluster emerged recently in the rodent genome, probably coincidentally with the acquisition of the imprinted control of Sfmbt2, very little is known about its functions. In this study, we generated mice lacking the entire Sfmbt2 miRNA cluster to elucidate its functions during development. Like the Sfmbt2 gene, the Sfmbt2 miRNAs were expressed in the placenta predominantly from the paternal allele. Loss of the paternal allele resulted in severely impaired development of the spongiotrophoblast layer, which usually comprises about half of the fetal placenta. This phenotype was associated with fetal developmental delay or lethality, leading to significant decreases in the number of fetuses and their weights at term. Microarray analysis identified that at least 30 miRNAs in the cluster were actively transcribed in wild-type placentas. Among the predicted targets of these miRNAs, 132 genes were upregulated in the miRNA-deleted placentas. Some of the genes most significantly upregulated, including Gkn2 and Runx1, are known to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Thus, the Sfmbt2 miRNAs play essential roles in promoting trophoblastic cell proliferation in the placenta, cooperating with the host gene under the same paternal expression control.
MicroRNA (miRNA) from mouse placentas were measured by microarray analysis. To identify target genes of Sfmbt2 miRNA cluster, gene expressions of placentas derived from wildtype and Sfmbt2 miRNA-deleted mice were measured. All placentas were collected in embryonic day 11.5 fetuses and more than four replicates were performed.","Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in mammals is an inefficient process that is frequently associated with abnormal phenotypes, especially in placentas. Recent studies demonstrated that mouse SCNT placentas completely lack histone methylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, but how it affects placental development remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the loss of H3K27me3 imprinting is responsible for abnormal placental enlargement and low birth rates following SCNT, through upregulation of imprinted miRNAs. When we restore the normal paternal expression of H3K27me3-dependent imprinted genes (Sfmbt2, Gab1, and Slc38a4) in SCNT placentas by maternal knockout, the placentas remain enlarged.

26702068,The impact of transgenic Uchl1 on gene expression in germinal center B-cells from ImHABCL6 mice,"Gene expression profiling has identified 2 major subclasses of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Cases resembling germinal center (GC) B cells (GCB-DLBCL) generally occur in younger patients, have a distinct molecular pathophysiology, and have improved outcomes compared with those similar to activated post-GC cells (activated B-cell DLBCL). We previously found that the ubiquitin hydrolase UCH-L1 is frequently overexpressed in mature B-cell malignancies and is a potent oncogene in mice. The cause for its overexpression in lymphoma, and whether it impacts the outcome of patients with DLBCL is unknown. Here, we show that UCH-L1 reflects GC lineage in lymphoma and is an oncogenic biomarker of aggressive GCB-DLBCL. We find that UCH-L1 is specifically induced in GC B cells in mice and humans, and that its expression correlates highly with the GCB subtype in DLBCL. We also find that UCH-L1 cooperates with BCL6 in a mouse model of GC B-cell lymphoma, but not with the development of multiple myeloma derived from post-GC cells. Despite the typically good outcomes of GCB-DLBCL, increased UCHL1 identifies a subgroup with early relapses independent of MYC expression, suggesting biological diversity in this subset of disease. Consistent with this, forced Uchl1 overexpression had a substantial impact on gene expression in GC B cells including pathways of cell cycle progression, cell death and proliferation, and DNA replication. These data demonstrate a novel role for UCH-L1 outside of the nervous system and suggest its potential use as a biomarker and therapeutic target in DLBCL.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Structure determination', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'protein', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'Kinase name', 'Regulatory RNA']"

We assessed the genes expressed in blood cells by microarray and found that the expression levels of 3,066 probes were state-dependently changed in the blood cells of patients with LOD. To select potential candidates from those probes, we assessed the genes expressed in the blood of an animal model of depression, ovariectomized female mice exposed to chronic ultra-mild stress, by microarray and cross-matched the differentially expressed genes between the patients and the model mice. We identified 14 differentially expressed genes that were similarly changed in both patients and the model mice. By assessing statistical significance using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the following 4 genes were selected as candidates: cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC), ribonuclease 1 (RNASE1), solute carrier family 36 member-1 (SLC36A1), and serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting-like 1 (STYXL1). The discriminating ability of these 4 candidate genes was evaluated in an independent cohort that was validated. Among them, CIDEC showed the greatest discriminant validity (sensitivity 91.3% and specificity 87.5%). Thus, these 4 biomarkers should be helpful for properly diagnosing LOD.","['Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*blood/*genetics', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Transcriptome']","['Sequence offset', 'Sequence set', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order', 'Demonstration', 'Protein interactions', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Examination of gene expression in one cell type +/- GDF6 knockdown as well as +/- downstream pathway reactivation.","Oncogenomic studies indicate that copy number variation (CNV) alters genes involved in tumor progression; however, identification of specific driver genes affected by CNV has been difficult, as these rearrangements are often contained in large chromosomal intervals among several bystander genes. Here, we addressed this problem and identified a CNV-targeted oncogene by performing comparative oncogenomics of human and zebrafish melanomas. We determined that the gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), which is the ligand for the BMP family, is recurrently amplified and transcriptionally upregulated in melanoma. GDF6-induced BMP signaling maintained a trunk neural crest gene signature in melanomas. Additionally, GDF6 repressed the melanocyte differentiation gene MITF and the proapoptotic factor SOX9, thereby preventing differentiation, inhibiting cell death, and promoting tumor growth. GDF6 was specifically expressed in melanomas but not melanocytes. Moreover, GDF6 expression levels in melanomas were inversely correlated with patient survival. Our study has identified a fundamental role for GDF6 and BMP signaling in governing an embryonic cell gene signature to promote melanoma progression, thus providing potential opportunities for targeted therapy to treat GDF6-positive cancers.","['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Growth Differentiation Factor 6/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Melanoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Genetic map', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'ELAND format', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein domains', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Giaever et al. previously revealed poor correlation between genes whose expression changes in response to acute stress and genes required to survive that stress, raising question about the role of stress-activated gene expression. Here we show that gene expression changes triggered by a single dose of stress are not required to survive that stimulus but rather serve a protective role against future stress. We characterized the increased resistance to severe stress in yeast preexposed to mild stress. This acquired stress resistance is dependent on protein synthesis during mild-stress treatment and requires the ""general-stress"" transcription factors Msn2p and/or Msn4p that regulate induction of many ESR genes. However, neither protein synthesis nor Msn2/4p is required for basal tolerance of a single dose of stress, despite the substantial expression changes triggered by each condition. Using microarrays, we show that Msn2p and Msn4p play nonredundant and condition-specific roles in gene-expression regulation, arguing against a generic general-stress function. This work highlights the importance of condition-specific responses in acquired stress resistance and provides new insights into the role of the ESR.","['DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Genome, Fungal/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Fungi', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
27453467,"Targeted HIV cure strategies require definition of the mechanisms that maintain the virus. Here, we tracked HIV replication and the persistence of infected CD4 T cells in individuals with natural virologic control by sequencing viruses, T cell receptor genes, HIV integration sites and cellular transcriptomes. Our results revealed three mechanisms of HIV persistence operating within distinct anatomic and functional compartments. In lymph node, we detected viruses with genetic and transcriptional attributes of active replication in both T follicular helper (TFH) cells and non-TFH memory cells. In blood, we detected inducible proviruses of archival origin among highly differentiated, clonally expanded cells. Linking the lymph node and blood was a small population of circulating cells harboring inducible proviruses of recent origin. Thus, HIV replication in lymphoid tissue, clonal expansion of infected cells, and recirculation of recently infected cells act together to maintain the virus in HIV controllers despite effective antiviral immunity.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort subsets of CD4 T cells from blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMC) and lymph node from a cohort of HIV-infected people with natural control of the virus (termed HIV controllers). Subsets of CD4 T cells that were sorted are as follows:  from blood, (1) naïve (N), (2) central memory (CM), (3) transitional memory (TM), and (4) effector memory (EM); from lymph node, (1) naïve (N), (2) non-germinal center T-follicular helpers (nGC), (3) germinal center T-follicular helpers (Tfh), (4) effector memory (EM), and (5) other central memory-like subsets (CMPD1lo57lo, CMPD1lo57hi, and/or CMPD1lo).  Total RNA and total DNA were extracted from these sorted subsets in separate fractions using RNAzol RT and DNAzol.  Total cellular DNA was used for HIV quantification and sequence analysis as describe in the publication. Total RNA used for mRNA library construction by oligo-dT purification (Dynabeads), random fragmentation by heating in the presence of Magnesium (in form of 5x first-strand buffer, LifeTech), reverse transcription (SuperScript III), and then second-strand synthesis, end repair, a-tailing, and adaptor ligation using NEBNext enzyme master mixes and oligonucleotides.

We investigated immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a multi-antigen (MA) universal influenza DNA vaccine consisting of HA, M2, and NP antigens in cynomolgus macaques. Following challenge with a heterologous pandemic H1N1 strain, vaccinated animals exhibited significantly lower viral loads and more rapid viral clearance when compared to unvaccinated controls. The MA DNA vaccine induced robust serum and mucosal antibody responses but these high antibody titers were not broadly neutralizing. In contrast, the vaccine induced broadly-reactive NP specific T cell responses that cross-reacted with the challenge virus and inversely correlated with lower viral loads and inflammation. These results demonstrate that a MA DNA vaccine that induces strong cross-reactive T cell responses can, independent of neutralizing antibody, mediate significant cross-protection in a nonhuman primate model and further supports development as an effective approach to induce broad protection against circulating and emerging influenza strains.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', '*Cross Reactions', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/immunology', 'Influenza Vaccines/genetics/*immunology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/*immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'HPA antibody id', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Protein interactions', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'DNA vaccine design', 'Vaccinology', ""Ensembl ID ('Macaca mulatta')"", 'DNA', 'dna']"
27343289,Harpellales Genomes,"Harpellales, an early-diverging fungal lineage, is associated with the digestive tracts of aquatic arthropod hosts. Concurrent with the production and annotation of the first four Harpellales genomes, we discovered that Zancudomyces culisetae, one of the most widely distributed Harpellales species, encodes an insect-like polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins are universally involved in protein degradation and regulation of immune response in eukaryotic organisms. Phylogenetic analyses inferred that this polyubiquitin variant has a mosquito origin. In addition, its amino acid composition, animal-like secondary structure, as well as the fungal nature of flanking genes all further support this as a horizontal gene transfer event. The single-copy polyubiquitin gene from Z. culisetae has lower GC ratio compared with homologs of insect taxa, which implies homogenization of the gene since its putatively ancient transfer. The acquired polyubiquitin gene may have served to improve important functions within Z. culisetae, by perhaps exploiting the insect hosts' ubiquitin-proteasome systems in the gut environment. Preliminary comparisons among the four Harpellales genomes highlight the reduced genome size of Z. culisetae, which corroborates its distinguishable symbiotic lifestyle. This is the first record of a horizontally transferred ubiquitin gene from disease-bearing insects to the gut-dwelling fungal endobiont and should invite further exploration in an evolutionary context.","['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Culicidae/*microbiology', 'Fungi/*genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology', '*Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Genome', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Symbiosis/genetics', 'Ubiquitin/*genetics', 'Ubiquitination/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Fungi', 'Fungi annotation', 'Fungi annotation (anamorph)', 'Gastroenterology', 'Abstract', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene ID', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation', 'Recombination detection', 'Ordination plot', 'DNA replication and recombination']"

The genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae strain WA1 was determined, making it the first representative of the genus Brachyspira to be sequenced, and the seventeenth spirochete genome to be reported. The genome consisted of a circular 3,000,694 base pair (bp) chromosome, and a 35,940 bp circular plasmid that has not previously been described. The spirochete had 2,122 protein-coding sequences. Of the predicted proteins, more had similarities to proteins of the enteric Escherichia coli and Clostridium species than they did to proteins of other spirochetes. Many of these genes were associated with transport and metabolism, and they may have been gradually acquired through horizontal gene transfer in the environment of the large intestine. A reconstruction of central metabolic pathways identified a complete set of coding sequences for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, a non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide metabolism, lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, and a respiratory electron transport chain. A notable finding was the presence on the plasmid of the genes involved in rhamnose biosynthesis. Potential virulence genes included those for 15 proteases and six hemolysins. Other adaptations to an enteric lifestyle included the presence of large numbers of genes associated with chemotaxis and motility.

In this study, we systematically investigated the profiles of seminal plasma piRNAs in infertile males to identify piRNAs that are altered during infertility and evaluate their diagnostic value. Seminal plasma samples were obtained from 211 infertile patients (asthenozoospermia and azoospermia) and 91 fertile controls. High-throughput sequencing technology was employed to screen piRNA profiles in seminal plasma samples pooled from healthy controls and infertile patients. The results identified 61 markedly altered piRNAs in infertile patient groups compared with control group. Next, a quantitative RT-PCR assay was conducted in the training and validation sets to measure and confirm the concentrations of altered piRNAs. The results identified a panel of 5 piRNAs that were significantly decreased in seminal plasma of infertile patients compared with healthy controls. ROC curve analysis and risk score analysis revealed that the diagnostic potential of these 5 piRNAs to distinguish asthenozoospermic and azoospermic individuals from healthy controls was high. In summary, this study identifies a panel of piRNAs that can accurately distinguish fertile from infertile males.

28701693,RNA-Seq of subcutaneous inguinal white fat of Hlx transgenic mice and littermate controls.,"Browning of subcutaneous white fat (iWAT) involves several reprograming events, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Hlx is selectively expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and iWAT, and is translationally upregulated by β3-adrenergic signaling-mediated suppression of the translational inhibitor 4E-BP1. Hlx interacts with and is co-activated by Prdm16 to control BAT-selective gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. Hlx heterozygous knockout mice have defects in brown-like adipocyte formation in iWAT, and develop glucose intolerance and high fat-induced hepatic steatosis. Conversely, transgenic expression of Hlx at a physiological level drives a full program of thermogenesis and converts iWAT to brown-like fat, which improves glucose homeostasis and prevents obesity and hepatic steatosis. The adipose remodeling phenotypes are recapitulated by fat-specific injection of Hlx knockdown and overexpression viruses, respectively. Our studies establish Hlx as a powerful regulator for systematic white adipose tissue browning and offer molecular insights into the underlying transcriptional mechanism.The transcriptional co-activator Prdm16 regulates browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, the authors show that Prdm16 interacts with the transcription factor Hlx, which is stabilized in response to β3-adrenergic signaling, to increase thermogenic gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in subcutaneous WAT.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Adipose Tissue, Brown/*metabolism', 'Adipose Tissue, White/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Fatty Liver/genetics', 'Glucose Intolerance/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organelle Biogenesis', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3/metabolism', 'Subcutaneous Fat/metabolism', 'Thermogenesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein signature', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Organelles', 'Genetic organisation', 'Model organisms', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins', 'Thermo RAW', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamics', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamic data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor accession']"
27297552,Autocrine Complement Inhibits IL10-Dependent T-cell-Mediated Antitumor Immunity to Promote Tumor Progression,"In contrast to its inhibitory effects on many cells, IL10 activates CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and enhances their antitumor activity. However, CD8(+) TILs do not routinely express IL10, as autocrine complement C3 inhibits IL10 production through complement receptors C3aR and C5aR. CD8(+) TILs from C3-deficient mice, however, express IL10 and exhibit enhanced effector function. C3-deficient mice are resistant to tumor development in a T-cell- and IL10-dependent manner; human TILs expanded with IL2 plus IL10 increase the killing of primary tumors in vitro compared with IL2-treated TILs. Complement-mediated inhibition of antitumor immunity is independent of the programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway. Our findings suggest that complement receptors C3aR and C5aR expressed on CD8(+) TILs represent a novel class of immune checkpoints that could be targeted for tumor immunotherapy. Moreover, incorporation of IL10 in the expansion of TILs and in gene-engineered T cells for adoptive cell therapy enhances their antitumor efficacy.","['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement C3/immunology/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Protein analysis', 'Reverse complement', 'Complementary medicine', 'Protein complex', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Tumor annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'R script', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
27261081,The Glioma-Infiltrating T Cell Receptor Repertoire,"Although immune signaling has emerged as a defining feature of the glioma microenvironment, how the underlying structure of the glioma-infiltrating T-cell population differs from that of the blood from which it originates has been difficult to measure directly in patients. High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the α- and β-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas. Finally, we identified a ""signature"" set of TCRs whose use in peripheral blood is associated with patients exhibiting low TIL divergence and is depleted in patients with highly divergent TIL repertoires. This signature is detectable in peripheral blood, and therefore accessible noninvasively. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to antiglioma vaccines and immunotherapy.","['Brain Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Glioma/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology']","['Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Tumor annotation', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Cell line report']"

Results of this analysis indicated that class-switched thymic B cells have a distinct repertoire compared with unswitched thymic B cells and splenic B cells. Further reactivity tests indicated that a large part of BCRs enriched in class-switched thymic B cells are autoreactive. These data suggest that autoreactive B cells are selected into class-switched population and expanded in the thymus.

28108515,"Purpose: Severe late normal tissue damage limits radiotherapy treatment regimens. This study aims to validate γ-H2AX foci decay ratios and induced expression levels of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair genes, found in a retrospective study, as possible predictors for late radiation toxicity.   Methods and Materials: Prospectively, decay ratios (initial/residual γ-H2AX foci numbers) and genome-wide expression profiles were examined in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes of 198 prostate cancer patients. All patients were followed ≥2 years after radiotherapy, clinical characteristics were assembled and toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0.    Results: No clinical factors were correlated with late radiation toxicity. Analysis of γ-H2AX foci uncovered a negative correlation between the foci decay ratio and toxicity grade. Significantly smaller decay ratios were found in grade≥3 compared to grade 0 patients (p=0.02), indicating less efficient DNA-DSB repair in radio-sensitive patients. Moreover, utilizing a foci decay ratio threshold determined in our previous retrospective study correctly classified 23 of the 28 grade≥3 patients (sensitivity, 82%) and 9 of the 14 grade 0 patients (specificity, 64%). Grade of toxicity also correlated with a reduced induction of the homologous recombination (HR) repair gene-set. The difference in average fold induction of the HR gene-set was most pronounced between grade 0 and grade≥3 patients (p=0.008).   Conclusions: Reduced responsiveness of HR repair genes to irradiation and inefficient DSB repair correlate with an increased risk of late radiation toxicity. Using a decay ratio classifier, we could correctly classify 82% of the patients with grade≥3 toxicity. Additional studies are required to further optimize and validate the foci decay assay and to assess its predictive value for late radiation toxicity in patients prostate cancer
Between 2009 and 2013, we prospectively accrued 200 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer receiving curative external beam radiotherapy in combination with hormonal therapy at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) of the University of Amsterdam, with a follow-up of ≥2 years. After written informed consent, 40 ml whole blood was collected of all patients before start of treatment. Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque PLUS, GE Healthcare) gradient separation, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Development of late toxicities was monitored over more than 2 years after treatment using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Toxicity grade was determined mainly focusing on late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities. Lymphocytes were cultured stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (concentration of 1μg/ml). After two weeks, half of the cells were irradiated at room temperature with 2Gy gamma rays from a 137Cs source, dose rate of approximately 0.5Gy/min and the other half of the cells was left untreated.  Total cellular RNA was isolated and gene expression levels were measured using the Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ PM Array platform for 400 samples (2 per patient) and 12 technical replicates (all labelled as 'prospective' below). Samples were also included for 7 patients [4 with (overresponding, R) and 3 without (non-responding, NR) severe late radiation toxicity] from a previous retrospective study (International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, 88(3):664-70; 2014) using total RNA isolated following an identical experimental protocol from whole-blood samples collected at least 2 years after radiation treatment. This was done either using previously isolated RNA stored at –80°C (14 samples, labelled as 'retrospective (old)' below) and freshly isolated RNA from newly collected whole-blood samples (14 samples, labelled as 'retrospective (new)' below). Samples were hybridized in two batches, the first batch consisting of 104 arrays on five array plates (2x16, 3x24) and the second batch of 336 arrays on five plates (2x24, 3x96). For all patients the irradiated (2Gy) and the control sample (0Gy) had by design been hybridrized in the same batch and, for the second and largest batch, on the same plate. Genes and genesets were determined that respond differently to irradiation between the four toxicity CTCAE 4.0 score-based patient groups. For 198 of the 200 patients from the prospective study the induction and decay of radiation-induced DNA–DSB breaks was monitored in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes by detecting γ-H2AX foci 30min and 24h post radiation.","Severe late damage to normal tissue is a major limitation of cancer radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. In a recent retrospective study, late radiation toxicity was found to relate to a decreased decay of γ-H2AX foci and reduced induction of DNA double-strand break repair genes. Here, we report evidence of prognostic utility in prostate cancer for γ-H2AX foci decay ratios and gene expression profiles derived from <i>ex vivo</i>-irradiated patient lymphocytes. Patients were followed ≥2 years after radiotherapy. Clinical characteristics were assembled, and toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0. No clinical factor was correlated with late radiation toxicity. The γ-H2AX foci decay ratio correlated negatively with toxicity grade, with a significant difference between grade ≥3 and grade 0 patients (<i>P</i> = 0.02). A threshold foci decay ratio, determined in our retrospective study, correctly classified 23 of 28 patients with grade ≥3 toxicity (sensitivity 82%) and 9 of 14 patients with grade 0 toxicity (specificity 64%). Induction of homologous recombination (HR) repair genes was reduced with increasing toxicity grade. The difference in fold induction of the HR gene set was most pronounced between grade 0 and grade ≥3 toxicity (<i>P</i> = 0.008). Notably, reduced responsiveness of HR repair genes to irradiation and inefficient double-strand break repair correlated with severe late radiation toxicity. Using a decay ratio classifier, we correctly classified 82% of patients with grade ≥3 toxicity, suggesting a prognostic biomarker for cancer patients with a genetically enhanced risk for late radiation toxicity to normal tissues after radiotherapy. <i>Cancer Res; 77(6); 1485-91. ©2017 AACR</i>.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*genetics', 'Recombinational DNA Repair/*genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Enzymes', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme report', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Histogram', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Gene family report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Parsing', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein active sites', 'Active site prediction', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'RH scores', 'pair']"

2-3 weeks of age (p13-21).","Endophilin-A, a well-characterized endocytic adaptor essential for synaptic vesicle recycling, has recently been linked to neurodegeneration. We report here that endophilin-A deficiency results in impaired movement, age-dependent ataxia, and neurodegeneration in mice. Transcriptional analysis of endophilin-A mutant mice, complemented by proteomics, highlighted ataxia- and protein-homeostasis-related genes and revealed upregulation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXO32/atrogin-1 and its transcription factor FOXO3A. FBXO32 overexpression triggers apoptosis in cultured cells and neurons but, remarkably, coexpression of endophilin-A rescues it. FBXO32 interacts with all three endophilin-A proteins. Similarly to endophilin-A, FBXO32 tubulates membranes and localizes on clathrin-coated structures. Additionally, FBXO32 and endophilin-A are necessary for autophagosome formation, and both colocalize transiently with autophagosomes. Our results point to a role for endophilin-A proteins in autophagy and protein degradation, processes that are impaired in their absence, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration and ataxia.","['Acyltransferases/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Aging/pathology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Ataxia/genetics/pathology', 'Autophagosomes/metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hippocampus/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Movement Disorders/complications/pathology', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nerve Degeneration/complications/pathology', 'Parkinson Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['Keyword', 'Imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Medical imaging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'Strain name', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Strain data format', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Epistasis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Protein complex', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein databases', 'Protein modelling', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression']"

Duplicate samples (total N = 10) were submitted for transcriptomics analysis to GENEWIZ (Seattle, USA). 1 x 50 bp were sequenced in single-read configuration in Rapid Run mode on a HiSeq 2500 System.","The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements/*pharmacology', 'Methane/*metabolism', 'Methanol/metabolism', 'Microbial Interactions/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Washington']","['Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Plant biology', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'DNA methylation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Protein interactions', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Validation']"
28630062,"Expression data from antigen-experienced Nfat1+/+ and Nfat1-/- CD4+ T cells following 21 days of Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL infection.
Total RNA was isolated from CD4+ CD49d+ CD11a-high cells sorted from spleens following 21 days Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL infection and subjected to microarray analysis.","Repeated stimulation of T cells that occurs in the context of chronic infection results in progressively reduced responsiveness of T cells to pathogen-derived antigens. This phenotype, known as T cell exhaustion, occurs during chronic infections caused by a variety of pathogens, from persistent viruses to parasites. Unlike the memory cells that typically form after successful pathogen clearance following an acute infection, exhausted T cells secrete lower levels of effector cytokines, proliferate less in response to cognate antigen, and upregulate cell surface inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 and LAG-3. The molecular events that lead to the induction of this phenotype have, however, not been fully characterized. In T cells, members of the NFAT family of transcription factors not only are responsible for the expression of many activation-induced genes but also are crucial for the induction of transcriptional programs that inhibit T cell activation and maintain tolerance. Here we show that NFAT1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells maintain higher proliferative capacity and expression of effector cytokines following <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> infection and are therefore more resistant to <i>P. yoelii</i>-induced exhaustion than their wild-type counterparts. Consequently, gene expression microarray analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following <i>P. yoelii</i>-induced exhaustion shows upregulation of effector T cell-associated genes in the absence of NFAT1 compared with wild-type exhausted T cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of NFAT1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into mice infected with <i>P. yoelii</i> results in increased production of antibodies to cognate antigen. Our results support the idea that NFAT1 is necessary to fully suppress effector responses during <i>Plasmodium</i>-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Malaria/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Plasmodium yoelii/*pathogenicity']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Sequence position', 'Protein active sites', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration track image', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Plasmid map']"
28893800,"VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC, but its effect on epigenetic landscape has not been elucidated previously. By performing histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3) from ccRCC cell lines, we describe the genome-wide cis-regulatory landscapes of VHL-deficient ccRCC tumors. We show that ccRCCs exhibit a pervasive gain of enhancers around hypoxic and metabolic transcriptional targets.
Histone ChIP-Seq in primary normal-tumor tissue pairs of ccRCC","Protein-coding mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have been extensively characterized, frequently involving inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (<i>VHL</i>) tumor suppressor. Roles for noncoding <i>cis</i>-regulatory aberrations in ccRCC tumorigenesis, however, remain unclear. Analyzing 10 primary tumor/normal pairs and 9 cell lines across 79 chromatin profiles, we observed pervasive enhancer malfunction in ccRCC, with cognate enhancer-target genes associated with tissue-specific aspects of malignancy. Superenhancer profiling identified <i>ZNF395</i> as a ccRCC-specific and VHL-regulated master regulator whose depletion causes near-complete tumor elimination <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i><i>VHL</i> loss predominantly drives enhancer/superenhancer deregulation more so than promoters, with acquisition of active enhancer marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) near ccRCC hallmark genes. Mechanistically, VHL loss stabilizes HIF2α-HIF1β heterodimer binding at enhancers, subsequently recruiting histone acetyltransferase p300 without overtly affecting preexisting promoter-enhancer interactions. Subtype-specific driver mutations such as <i>VHL</i> may thus propagate unique pathogenic dependencies in ccRCC by modulating epigenomic landscapes and cancer gene expression.<b>Significance:</b> Comprehensive epigenomic profiling of ccRCC establishes a compendium of somatically altered <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, uncovering new potential targets including ZNF395, a ccRCC master regulator.

25189356,Whole Transcriptomic Sequencing of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Samples,"Men with metastatic prostate cancer who are treated with androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) usually relapse within 2 to 3 years with disease that is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To identify the mechanism that drives these advanced tumors, paired-end RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on a panel of CRPC bone marrow biopsy specimens. From this genome-wide approach, mutations were found in a series of genes with prostate cancer relevance, including AR, NCOR1, KDM3A, KDM4A, CHD1, SETD5, SETD7, INPP4B, RASGRP3, RASA1, TP53BP1, and CDH1, and a novel SND1:BRAF gene fusion. Among the most highly expressed transcripts were 10 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including MALAT1 and PABPC1, which are involved in RNA processing. Notably, a high percentage of sequence reads mapped to introns, which were determined to be the result of incomplete splicing at canonical splice junctions. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), a series of genes (AR, KLK2, KLK3, STEAP2, CPSF6, and CDK19) were confirmed to have a greater proportion of unspliced RNA in CRPC specimens than in normal prostate epithelium, untreated primary prostate cancer, and cultured prostate cancer cells. This inefficient coupling of transcription and mRNA splicing suggests an overall increase in transcription or defect in splicing.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Local alignment', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Statistical calculation', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'RNA splicing', 'Sequence merging', 'Splicing analysis', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

So far, the activation of host translational control mechanisms by bacterial toxins, owing to specific recruitment of mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs), are far from being understood. In the present study, we characterize for the first time the changes experienced by the translational control system of host cells in response to the well-known Staphylococcus aureus α-haemolysin (AHL) under both sublytic and lytic conditions. By comparing variations occurring in the cellular transcriptome and translatome, we give evidence that global gene expression is primarily rewired at the translational level, with the contribution of the RBP ELAVL1 (HuR) in the sublytic response.

24265725,"microRNA profiling of lung adenocarcinomas, induced by cRaf overexpression in lung epithelium","Non-coding RNAs play major roles in the translational control of gene expression. In order to identify disease-associated miRNAs in precursor lesions of lung cancer, RNA extracts from lungs of either c-Raf transgenic or wild-type (WT) mice were hybridized to the Agilent and Affymetrix miRNA microarray platforms, respectively. This resulted in the detection of a range of miRNAs varying between 111 and 267, depending on the presence or absence of the transgene, on the gender, and on the platform used. Importantly, when the two platforms were compared, only 11-16% of the 586 overlapping genes were commonly detected. With the Agilent microarray, seven miRNAs were identified as significantly regulated, of which three were selectively up-regulated in male transgenic mice. Much to our surprise, when the same samples were analyzed with the Affymetrix platform, only two miRNAs were identified as significantly regulated. Quantitative PCR performed with lung RNA extracts from WT and transgenic mice confirmed only partially the differential expression of significant regulated miRNAs and established that the Agilent platform failed to detect miR-433. Finally, bioinformatic analyses predicted a total of 152 mouse genes as targets of the regulated miRNAs of which 4 and 11 genes were significantly regulated at the mRNA level, respectively in laser micro-dissected lung dysplasia and lung adenocarcinomas of c-Raf transgenic mice. Furthermore, for many of the predicted mouse target genes expression of the coded protein was also repressed in human lung cancer when the publically available database of the Human Protein Atlas was analyzed, thus supporting the clinical significance of our findings. In conclusion, a significant difference in a cross-platform comparison was observed that will have important implications for research into miRNAs.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein modifications', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Base pairing probability matrix dotplot', 'Base-calling', 'pair', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence data', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
25249463,"Cascade regulation of sweat gland development by Wnt, Eda and Shh pathways","To maintain body temperature, sweat glands develop from embryonic ectoderm by a poorly defined mechanism. We demonstrate a temporal cascade of regulation during mouse sweat gland formation. Sweat gland induction failed completely when canonical Wnt signaling was blocked in skin epithelium, and was accompanied by sharp downregulation of downstream Wnt, Eda and Shh pathway genes. The Wnt antagonist Dkk4 appeared to inhibit this induction: Dkk4 was sharply downregulated in β-catenin-ablated mice, indicating that it is induced by Wnt/β-catenin; however, its overexpression repressed Wnt target genes and significantly reduced gland numbers. Eda signaling succeeded Wnt. Wnt signaling was still active and nascent sweat gland pre-germs were still seen in Eda-null mice, but the pre-germs failed to develop further and the downstream Shh pathway was not activated. When Wnt and Eda were intact but Shh was ablated, germ induction and subsequent duct formation occurred normally, but the final stage of secretory coil formation failed. Thus, sweat gland development shows a relay of regulatory steps initiated by Wnt/β-catenin - itself modulated by Dkk4 - with subsequent participation of Eda and Shh pathways.","['Animals', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Ectodysplasins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Galactosides', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indoles', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sweat Glands/*embryology/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/deficiency']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Primers', 'PCR primers', 'Primer3 primer', 'Laboratory techniques', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'gxformat2', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Molecules', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Beta diversity data']"

Previous phylogenetic analyses have not consistently resolved the relationships among major hemipteroid lineages. We provide maximum likelihood-based phylogenomic analyses of a taxonomically comprehensive dataset comprising sequences of 2,395 single-copy, protein-coding genes for 193 samples of hemipteroid insects and outgroups. These analyses yield a well-supported phylogeny for hemipteroid insects. Monophyly of each of the three hemipteroid orders (Psocodea, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera) is strongly supported, as are most relationships among suborders and families. Thysanoptera (thrips) is strongly supported as sister to Hemiptera. However, as in a recent large-scale analysis sampling all insect orders, trees from our data matrices support Psocodea (bark lice and parasitic lice) as the sister group to the holometabolous insects (those with complete metamorphosis). In contrast, four-cluster likelihood mapping of these data does not support this result. A molecular dating analysis using 23 fossil calibration points suggests hemipteroid insects began diversifying before the Carboniferous, over 365 million years ago. We also explore implications for understanding the timing of diversification, the evolution of morphological traits, and the evolution of mitochondrial genome organization.

However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals.

27310713,Gene expression anlaysis of laser-capture microdissected tumor and stroma from triple negative breast cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into distinct molecular subtypes by gene expression profiling. Considered a difficult-to-treat cancer, a fraction of TNBC patients benefit significantly from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have far better overall survival. Outside of BRCA1/2 mutation status, biomarkers do not exist to identify patients most likely to respond to current chemotherapy; and, to date, no FDA-approved targeted therapies are available for TNBC patients. Previously, we developed an approach to identify six molecular subtypes TNBC (TNBCtype), with each subtype displaying unique ontologies and differential response to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Given the complexity of the varying histological landscape of tumor specimens, we used histopathological quantification and laser-capture microdissection to determine that transcripts in the previously described immunomodulatory (IM) and mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtypes were contributed from infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated stromal cells, respectively. Therefore, we refined TNBC molecular subtypes from six (TNBCtype) into four (TNBCtype-4) tumor-specific subtypes (BL1, BL2, M and LAR) and demonstrate differences in diagnosis age, grade, local and distant disease progression and histopathology. Using five publicly available, neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer gene expression datasets, we retrospectively evaluated chemotherapy response of over 300 TNBC patients from pretreatment biopsies subtyped using either the intrinsic (PAM50) or TNBCtype approaches. Combined analysis of TNBC patients demonstrated that TNBC subtypes significantly differ in response to similar neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 41% of BL1 patients achieving a pathological complete response compared to 18% for BL2 and 29% for LAR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs; [33, 51], [9, 28], [17, 41], respectively). Collectively, we provide pre-clinical data that could inform clinical trials designed to test the hypothesis that improved outcomes can be achieved for TNBC patients, if selection and combination of existing chemotherapies is directed by knowledge of molecular TNBC subtypes.","['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Computational Biology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laser Capture Microdissection', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/drug effects/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*classification/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality']","['Plant biology', 'Protocol', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Topic', 'Tool topic', 'Data', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Exome sequencing', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Tumor annotation', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Parsing', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis']"
21396969,Sinorhizobium meliloti SM11 genome sequencing project,"Isolates of the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing species Sinorhizobium meliloti usually contain a chromosome and two large megaplasmids encoding functions that are absolutely required for the specific interaction of the microsymbiont with corresponding host plants leading to an effective symbiosis. The complete genome sequence, including the megaplasmids pSmeSM11c (related to pSymA) and pSmeSM11d (related to pSymB), was established for the dominant, indigenous S. meliloti strain SM11 that had been isolated during a long-term field release experiment with genetically modified S. meliloti strains. The chromosome, the largest replicon of S. meliloti SM11, is 3,908,022bp in size and codes for 3785 predicted protein coding sequences. The size of megaplasmid pSmeSM11c is 1,633,319bp and it contains 1760 predicted protein coding sequences whereas megaplasmid pSmeSM11d is 1,632,395bp in size and comprises 1548 predicted coding sequences. The gene content of the SM11 chromosome is quite similar to that of the reference strain S. meliloti Rm1021. Comparison of pSmeSM11c to pSymA of the reference strain revealed that many gene regions of these replicons are variable, supporting the assessment that pSymA is a major hot-spot for intra-specific differentiation. Plasmids pSymA and pSmeSM11c both encode unique genes. Large gene regions of pSmeSM11c are closely related to corresponding parts of Sinorhizobium medicae WSM419 plasmids. Moreover, pSmeSM11c encodes further novel gene regions, e.g. additional plasmid survival genes (partition, mobilisation and conjugative transfer genes), acdS encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase involved in modulation of the phytohormone ethylene level and genes having predicted functions in degradative capabilities, stress response, amino acid metabolism and associated pathways. In contrast to Rm1021 pSymA and pSmeSM11c, megaplasmid pSymB of strain Rm1021 and pSmeSM11d are highly conserved showing extensive synteny with only few rearrangements. Most remarkably, pSmeSM11b contains a new gene cluster predicted to be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Compilation of the S. meliloti SM11 genome sequence contributes to an extension of the S. meliloti pan-genome.","['Bacteriophages/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Bacterial', 'Ethylenes/metabolism', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Medicago sativa/microbiology', 'Nitrogen Fixation', 'Nitrous Oxide/metabolism', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Root Nodules, Plant/microbiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sinorhizobium meliloti/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Symbiosis']","['Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'DNA methylation', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Gene ID (MIPS Medicago)', 'Medical informatics', 'Medicine', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'GEN', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Plasmid map drawing', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"
30699355,Global phosphoproteome and transcriptome integration of Chlamydia trachomatis infection,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) causes a range of infectious diseases and is epidemiologically associated with cervical and ovarian cancers. To obtain a panoramic view of Ctr-induced signaling, we performed global phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses. We identified numerous Ctr phosphoproteins and Ctr-regulated host phosphoproteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins were predominantly related to transcription regulation, cellular growth, proliferation, and cytoskeleton organization. In silico kinase substrate motif analysis revealed that MAPK and CDK were the most overrepresented upstream kinases for upregulated phosphosites. Several of the regulated host phosphoproteins were transcription factors, including ETS1 and ERF, that are downstream targets of MAPK. Functional analysis of phosphoproteome and transcriptome data confirmed their involvement in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotype that was validated in infected cells, along with the essential role of ERK1/2, ETS1, and ERF for Ctr replication. Our data reveal the extent of Ctr-induced signaling and provide insights into its pro-carcinogenic potential.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Chlamydia trachomatis/*physiology', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome/genetics']","['Nucleic acid report', 'Nucleic acid structure report', 'Cell line report', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell biology', 'Transition matrix', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Proteins', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"
27734577,Amino acid catabolism fuels microalgal lipogenesis,"Microalgal neutral lipids [mainly in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs)], feasible substrates for biofuel, are typically accumulated during the stationary growth phase. To make microalgal biofuels economically competitive with fossil fuels, generating strains that trigger TAG accumulation from the exponential growth phase is a promising biological approach. The regulatory mechanisms to trigger TAG accumulation from the exponential growth phase (TAEP) are important to be uncovered for advancing economic feasibility. Through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase by sodium dichloroacetate, acetyl-CoA level increased, resulting in TAEP in microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta. We further reported refilling of acetyl-CoA pool through branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributed to an overall sixfold TAEP with marginal compromise (4%) on growth in a TAG-rich D. tertiolecta mutant from targeted screening. Herein, a three-step α loop-integrated metabolic model is introduced to shed lights on the neutral lipid regulatory mechanism. This article provides novel approaches to compress lipid production phase and heightens lipid productivity and photosynthetic carbon capture via enhancing acetyl-CoA level, which would optimize renewable microalgal biofuel to fulfil the demanding fuel market.","['Acetyl Coenzyme A/*metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', '*Biofuels', 'Microalgae/*metabolism', 'Triglycerides/metabolism']","['Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Microarray experiment', 'Microarrays', 'Raw microarray data format']"
27856763,Neurospora crassa genome organization requires subtelomeric facultative heterochromatin,"High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analyses revealed that the 3D structure of the Neurospora crassa genome is dominated by intra- and interchromosomal links between regions of heterochromatin, especially constitutive heterochromatin. Elimination of trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) or its binding partner Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1)-both prominent features of constitutive heterochromatin-have little effect on the Hi-C pattern. It remained possible that di- or trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3), which becomes localized in regions of constitutive heterochromatin when H3K9me3 or HP1 are lost, plays a critical role in the 3D structure of the genome. We found that H3K27me2/3, catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member SET-7 (SET domain protein-7), does indeed play a prominent role in the Hi-C pattern of WT, but that its presence in regions normally occupied by H3K9me3 is not responsible for maintenance of the genome architecture when H3K9me3 is lost. The Hi-C pattern of a mutant defective in the PRC2 member N. crassa p55 (NPF), which is predominantly required for subtelomeric H3K27me2/3, was equivalent to that of the set-7 deletion strain, suggesting that subtelomeric facultative heterochromatin is paramount for normal chromosome conformation. Both PRC2 mutants showed decreased heterochromatin-heterochromatin contacts and increased euchromatin-heterochromatin contacts. Cytological observations suggested elimination of H3K27me2/3 leads to partial displacement of telomere clusters from the nuclear periphery. Transcriptional profiling of Δdim-5, Δset-7, Δset-7; Δdim-5, and Δnpf strains detailed anticipated changes in gene expression but did not support the idea that global changes in genome architecture, per se, led to altered transcription.","['Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Cytosine/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome, Fungal', 'Heterochromatin/*chemistry', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Neurospora crassa/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Telomere/ultrastructure']","['protein', 'Gene family report', 'Homology modelling', 'Proteins', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Cytometry', 'Cytoband position', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Histogram', 'Analysis', 'Protein interaction format', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
27477906,ZMYND8 reads the dual histone mark H3K4me1-H3K14ac to antagonize the expression of metastasis-linked genes,"Histone acetylation, including acetylated H3K14 (H3K14ac), is generally linked to gene activation. Monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1), together with other gene-activating marks, denotes active genes. In contrast to usual gene-activating functions of H3K14ac and H3K4me1, we here show that the dual histone modification mark H3K4me1-H3K14ac is recognized by ZMYND8 (also called RACK7) and can function to counteract gene expression. We identified ZMYND8 as a transcriptional corepressor of the H3K4 demethylase JARID1D. ZMYND8 antagonized the expression of metastasis-linked genes, and its knockdown increased the cellular invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. The plant homeodomain (PHD) and Bromodomain cassette in ZMYND8 mediated the combinatorial recognition of H3K4me1-H3K14ac and H3K4me0-H3K14ac by ZMYND8. These findings uncover an unexpected role for the signature H3K4me1-H3K14ac in attenuating gene expression and reveal a metastasis-suppressive epigenetic mechanism in which ZMYND8's PHD-Bromo cassette couples H3K4me1-H3K14ac with downregulation of metastasis-linked genes.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/secondary', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors for Activated C Kinase', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein domains', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Citation', 'Kinase name', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'DNA translation', 'Structural transformation matrix']"
28919018,Neocalanus flemingeri adult females,"Copepods, small planktonic crustaceans, are key links between primary producers and upper trophic levels, including many economically important fishes. In the subarctic North Pacific, the life cycle of copepods like Neocalanus flemingeri includes an ontogenetic migration to depth followed by a period of diapause (a type of dormancy) characterized by arrested development and low metabolic activity. The end of diapause is marked by the production of the first brood of eggs. Recent temperature anomalies in the North Pacific have raised concerns about potential negative effects on N. flemingeri. Since diapause is a developmental program, its progress can be tracked using through global gene expression. Thus, a reference transcriptome was developed as a first step towards physiological profiling of diapausing females using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. The de novo transcriptome, the first for this species was designed to investigate the diapause period. RNA-Seq reads were obtained for dormant to reproductive N. flemingeri females. A high quality de novo transcriptome was obtained by first assembling reads from each individual using Trinity software followed by clustering with CAP3 Assembly Program. This assembly consisted of 140,841transcripts (contigs). Bench-marking universal single-copy orthologs analysis identified 85% of core eukaryotic genes, with 79% predicted to be complete. Comparison with other calanoid transcriptomes confirmed its quality and degree of completeness. Trinity assembly of reads originating from multiple individuals led to fragmentation. Thus, the workflow applied here differed from the one recommended by Trinity, but was required to obtain a good assembly.","['Animals', 'Climate Change', 'Copepoda/genetics/*physiology', '*Diapause', 'Female', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Temperature', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Format', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate calculation', 'codata', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
28181347,Shear stress induces immunomodulatory signaling in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs),"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are believed to mobilize from the bone marrow in response to inflammation and injury, yet the effects of egress into the vasculature on MSC function are largely unknown. Here we show that wall shear stress (WSS) typical of fluid frictional forces present on the vascular lumen stimulates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as chemokines capable of immune cell recruitment. WSS specifically promotes signaling through NFκB-COX2-prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub> ) to suppress tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production by activated immune cells. Ex vivo conditioning of MSCs by WSS improved therapeutic efficacy in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, as evidenced by decreased apoptotic and M1-type activated microglia in the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that force provides critical cues to MSCs residing at the vascular interface which influence immunomodulatory and paracrine activity, and suggest the potential therapeutic use of force for MSC functional enhancement.

We compared 34 +XMKTx (19 receiving eculizumab and 15 receiving standard of care without eculizumab) to 13 -XMKTx (between August 2001 and August 2011). At 10 days, light microscopy identified subclinical inflammation in only 18% of +XMKTx, while intragraft gene expression identified inflammation in 79% (gene sets for activated macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells or T cells). Inflammation persisted at 90 days and was associated with the development of transplant glomerulopathy by 2 years and graft loss. In contrast, endothelial cell (EC) changes present at 90 days by either electron microscopy or gene expression were not associated with transplant glomerulopathy or graft loss in this cohort. Eculizumab treatment did not appear to alter inflammation or EC changes. Therefore, intragraft inflammation might be an appropriate surrogate marker of progression and also a target of therapy to prevent chronic antibody-mediated rejection.","['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Disease Progression', '*Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/complications/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Graft Survival', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Kidney/ultrastructure', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']","['X-ray diffraction', 'Human biology', 'BioPAX', 'Biophysics', 'BioPax term', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Selection detection', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'Plant biology', 'MAT', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Mass spectrum', 'Protein active sites', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
27365498,"Loss of MeCP2 in the rat models regression, impaired sociability and transcriptional deficits of Rett syndrome","Mouse models of the transcriptional modulator Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) have advanced our understanding of Rett syndrome (RTT). RTT is a 'prototypical' neurodevelopmental disorder with many clinical features overlapping with other intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Therapeutic interventions for RTT may therefore have broader applications. However, the reliance on the laboratory mouse to identify viable therapies for the human condition may present challenges in translating findings from the bench to the clinic. In addition, the need to identify outcome measures in well-chosen animal models is critical for preclinical trials. Here, we report that a novel Mecp2 rat model displays high face validity for modelling psychomotor regression of a learned skill, a deficit that has not been shown in Mecp2 mice. Juvenile play, a behavioural feature that is uniquely present in rats and not mice, is also impaired in female Mecp2 rats. Finally, we demonstrate that evaluating the molecular consequences of the loss of MeCP2 in both mouse and rat may result in higher predictive validity with respect to transcriptional changes in the human RTT brain. These data underscore the similarities and differences caused by the loss of MeCP2 among divergent rodent species which may have important implications for the treatment of individuals with disease-causing MECP2 mutations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the Mecp2 rat model is a complementary tool with unique features for the study of RTT and highlight the potential benefit of cross-species analyses in identifying potential disease-relevant preclinical outcome measures.","['Animals', '*Behavior, Animal', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Transgenic', '*Rett Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription']"
29972771,Systemic gain and loss of chromatin architecture throughout zebrafish development [4C],"The spatial organization of chromosomes is critical in establishing gene expression programs. We generated in situ Hi-C maps throughout zebrafish development to gain insight into higher-order chromatin organization and dynamics. Zebrafish chromosomes segregate in active and inactive chromatin (A/B compartments), which are further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs). Zebrafish A/B compartments and TADs have genomic features similar to those of their mammalian counterparts, including evolutionary conservation and enrichment of CTCF binding sites at TAD borders. At the earliest time point, when there is no zygotic transcription, the genome is highly structured. After zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the genome loses structural features, which are re-established throughout early development. Despite the absence of structural features, we see clustering of super-enhancers in the 3D genome. Our results provide insight into vertebrate genome organization and demonstrate that the developing zebrafish embryo is a powerful model system to study the dynamics of nuclear organization.","['Animals', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome', 'Histone Code', 'Zebrafish/*embryology/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Gene ID', 'Histogram', 'CATH node ID', 'Fish']"

Myofibroblasts remain a poorly defined cell type in terms of their origins and functional effects in vivo. Here we generate Postn (periostin) gene-targeted mice containing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre for cellular lineage-tracing analysis. This Postn allele identifies essentially all myofibroblasts within the heart and multiple other tissues. Lineage tracing with four additional Cre-expressing mouse lines shows that periostin-expressing myofibroblasts in the heart derive from tissue-resident fibroblasts of the Tcf21 lineage, but not endothelial, immune/myeloid or smooth muscle cells. Deletion of periostin(+) myofibroblasts reduces collagen production and scar formation after MI. Periostin-traced myofibroblasts also revert back to a less-activated state upon injury resolution. Our results define the myofibroblast as a periostin-expressing cell type necessary for adaptive healing and fibrosis in the heart, which arises from Tcf21(+) tissue-resident fibroblasts.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Integrases', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocardial Infarction/*pathology', 'Myocardium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myofibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Tamoxifen']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Multiomics', 'Integrated gene prediction', 'Ion counting', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Clinical trial report', 'Information extraction', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)']"

We assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in human macrophage-like U937 cells following infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, an intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of human melioidosis. Our analyses revealed significant changes in host cell DNA methylation, at multiple CpG sites in the host cell genome, following infection. Infection induced differentially methylated probes (iDMPs) showing the greatest changes in DNA methylation were found to be in the vicinity of genes involved in inflammatory responses, intracellular signalling, apoptosis and pathogen-induced signalling. A comparison of our data with reported methylome changes in cells infected with M. tuberculosis revealed commonality of differentially methylated genes, including genes involved in T cell responses (BCL11B, FOXO1, KIF13B, PAWR, SOX4, SYK), actin cytoskeleton organisation (ACTR3, CDC42BPA, DTNBP1, FERMT2, PRKCZ, RAC1), and cytokine production (FOXP1, IRF8, MR1).

Multiple algorithms have been developed to derive gene counts from sequencing reads. While a number of benchmarking studies have been conducted, the question remains how individual methods perform at accurately quantifying gene expression levels from RNA-sequencing reads. We performed an independent benchmarking study using RNA-sequencing data from the well established MAQCA and MAQCB reference samples. RNA-sequencing reads were processed using five workflows (Tophat-HTSeq, Tophat-Cufflinks, STAR-HTSeq, Kallisto and Salmon) and resulting gene expression measurements were compared to expression data generated by wet-lab validated qPCR assays for all protein coding genes. All methods showed high gene expression correlations with qPCR data. When comparing gene expression fold changes between MAQCA and MAQCB samples, about 85% of the genes showed consistent results between RNA-sequencing and qPCR data. Of note, each method revealed a small but specific gene set with inconsistent expression measurements. A significant proportion of these method-specific inconsistent genes were reproducibly identified in independent datasets. These genes were typically smaller, had fewer exons, and were lower expressed compared to genes with consistent expression measurements.

28749250,Thalicthuberine: A Novel Mitotic Inhibitor in Prostate Cancer Cells,"We report for the first time the mechanism of action of the natural product thalicthuberine (TH) in prostate and cervical cancer cells. TH induced a strong accumulation of LNCaP cells in mitosis, severe mitotic spindle defects, and asymmetric cell divisions, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe accompanied by cell death through apoptosis. However, unlike microtubule-binding drugs (vinblastine and paclitaxel), TH did not directly inhibit tubulin polymerization when tested in a cell-free system, whereas it reduced cellular microtubule polymer mass in LNCaP cells. This suggests that TH indirectly targets microtubule dynamics through inhibition of a critical regulator or tubulin-associated protein. Furthermore, TH is not a major substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is responsible for multidrug resistance in numerous cancers, providing a rationale to further study TH in cancers with Pgp-mediated treatment resistance. The identification of TH's molecular target in future studies will be of great value to the development of TH as potential treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors.","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antimitotic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects/physiology', 'Tubulin/genetics/metabolism']","['Kinase name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Cell cycle', 'Psiblast checkpoint file', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Microbiology', 'Microsatellites', 'Protein microarrays', 'Mitochondria', 'Phenotype name', 'Phenomics']"

24385922,Clustering of tissue-specific sub-TADs accompanies the regulation of HoxA genes in developing limbs,"HoxA genes exhibit central roles during development and causal mutations have been found in several human syndromes including limb malformation. Despite their importance, information on how these genes are regulated is lacking. Here, we report on the first identification of bona fide transcriptional enhancers controlling HoxA genes in developing limbs and show that these enhancers are grouped into distinct topological domains at the sub-megabase scale (sub-TADs). We provide evidence that target genes and regulatory elements physically interact with each other through contacts between sub-TADs rather than by the formation of discreet ""DNA loops"". Interestingly, there is no obvious relationship between the functional domains of the enhancers within the limb and how they are partitioned among the topological domains, suggesting that sub-TAD formation does not rely on enhancer activity. Moreover, we show that suppressing the transcriptional activity of enhancers does not abrogate their contacts with HoxA genes. Based on these data, we propose a model whereby chromatin architecture defines the functional landscapes of enhancers. From an evolutionary standpoint, our data points to the convergent evolution of HoxA and HoxD regulation in the fin-to-limb transition, one of the major morphological innovations in vertebrates.","['Animals', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Extremities/*growth & development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Vertebrates/genetics/growth & development']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Data retrieval', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Vertebrates', 'Invertebrates']"
24737864,The nucleosomal barrier to promoter escape by RNA Polymerase II is overcome by the chromatin remodeler Chd1 [HiSeq],"RNA polymerase II (PolII) transcribes RNA within a chromatin context, with nucleosomes acting as barriers to transcription. Despite these barriers, transcription through chromatin in vivo is highly efficient, suggesting the existence of factors that overcome this obstacle. To increase the resolution obtained by standard chromatin immunoprecipitation, we developed a novel strategy using micrococcal nuclease digestion of cross-linked chromatin. We find that the chromatin remodeler Chd1 is recruited to promoter proximal nucleosomes of genes undergoing active transcription, where Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover. The expression of a dominant negative form of Chd1 results in increased stalling of PolII past the entry site of the promoter proximal nucleosomes. We find that Chd1 evicts nucleosomes downstream of the promoter in order to overcome the nucleosomal barrier and enable PolII promoter escape, thus providing mechanistic insight into the role of Chd1 in transcription and pluripotency.

32071196,Sir2 and Hst1 ChIP-Seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Evolutionary adaptation increases the fitness of a species in its environment. It can occur through rewiring of gene regulatory networks, such that an organism responds appropriately to environmental changes. We investigated whether sirtuin deacetylases, which repress transcription and require NAD<sup>+</sup> for activity, serve as transcriptional rewiring points that facilitate the evolution of potentially adaptive traits. If so, bringing genes under the control of sirtuins could enable organisms to mount appropriate responses to stresses that decrease NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. To explore how the genomic targets of sirtuins shift over evolutionary time, we compared two yeast species, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, that display differences in cellular metabolism and life cycle timing in response to nutrient availability. We identified sirtuin-regulated genes through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA expression. In both species, regulated genes were associated with NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, mating, and sporulation, but the specific genes differed. In addition, regulated genes in <i>K. lactis</i> were associated with other processes, including utilization of nonglucose carbon sources, detoxification of arsenic, and production of the siderophore pulcherrimin. Consistent with the species-restricted regulation of these genes, sirtuin deletion affected relevant phenotypes in <i>K. lactis</i> but not <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Finally, sirtuin-regulated gene sets were depleted for broadly conserved genes, consistent with sirtuins regulating processes restricted to a few species. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that sirtuins serve as rewiring points that allow species to evolve distinct responses to low NAD<sup>+</sup> stress.","['*Evolution, Molecular', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Homeostasis', 'Kluyveromyces', 'NAD/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spores, Fungal/genetics/physiology', '*Stress, Physiological']","['Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Epistasis', 'Name', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein interaction format', 'Protein report format', 'Fungi', 'Fungi annotation', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"

Despite the widespread use of flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes, the health impacts of the flavoring compounds, in particular their effects on critical cellular function in the lung, remain largely unknown. The goal of this study was to identify transcriptomic changes and impacted biological pathways in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) exposed to flavoring chemicals (diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione) and to flavored e-cigarette smoke.An airway-liquid interface culturing method was used to differentiate primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) into mature epithelial cells, which were then treated with 25 ppm diacetyl, 100 ppm 2,3 pentanedione, or e-cigarette smoke solution containing 2 ppm diacetyl. Poly(A)-selected RNA-Seq libraries were prepared with the PrepX RNA-Seq for Illumina Library kit. An Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument was used to generate 50 base pair single-end reads. STAR was used to align sequencing reads to the hg38 reference genome, and HTSeq was used to quantify transcript levels. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis.
Transcriptome profiles obtained via RNA-Seq for normal human bronchial epithelium cells (3-donor pool) treated in duplicate with 25 ppm diacetyl, 100 ppm 2,3 pentanedione, e-cigarette smoke solution containing 2 ppm diacetylor, or vehicle control for 24 hours were obtained to measure the effects of exposure to e-cigarette smoke and its flavoring chemicals.","The widespread use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or e-cig) is a growing public health concern. Diacetyl and its chemical cousin 2,3-pentanedione are commonly used to add flavors to e-cig; however, little is known about how the flavoring chemicals may impair lung function. Here we report that the flavoring chemicals induce transcriptomic changes and perturb cilia function in the airway epithelium. Using RNA-Seq, we identified a total of 163 and 568 differentially expressed genes in primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells that were exposed to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, respectively. DAVID pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of cellular pathways involved in cytoskeletal and cilia processes among the set of common genes (142 genes) perturbed by both diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione. Consistent with this, qRT-PCR confirmed that the expression of multiple genes involved in cilia biogenesis was significantly downregulated by diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in NHBE cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of ciliated cells was significantly decreased by the flavoring chemicals. Our study indicates that the two widely used e-cig flavoring chemicals impair the cilia function in airway epithelium and likely contribute to the adverse effects of e-cig in the lung.","['Bronchi/*cytology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cilia/*physiology', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Diacetyl/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Epithelial Cells/*physiology', 'Flavoring Agents/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure/adverse effects', 'Lung/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptome']","['InChI', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Phylogenetic tree reconciliation', 'Cytometry', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Cytogenetics', 'Systems medicine', 'Electronic health record', 'QSAR descriptor (electronic)', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Relation extraction', 'Information extraction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

29263199,The dynamic recruitment of TRBP to neuronal membranes mediates dendritogenesis during development,"MicroRNAs are important regulators of local protein synthesis during neuronal development. We investigated the dynamic regulation of microRNA production and found that the majority of the microRNA-generating complex, consisting of Dicer, TRBP, and PACT, specifically associates with intracellular membranes in developing neurons. Stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which promotes dendritogenesis, caused the redistribution of TRBP from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, and its dissociation from Dicer, in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. As a result, the processing of a subset of neuronal precursor microRNAs, among them the dendritically localized pre-miR16, was impaired. Decreased production of miR-16-5p, which targeted the BDNF mRNA itself, was rescued by expression of a membrane-targeted TRBP Moreover, miR-16-5p or membrane-targeted TRBP expression blocked BDNF-induced dendritogenesis, demonstrating the importance of neuronal TRBP dynamics for activity-dependent neuronal development.

While lncRNAs modulate diverse physiological and pathological cellular processes, their involvement in heme-dependent mechanisms is largely unexplored. In this study, we elucidated a lncRNA (UCA1)-mediated mechanism that regulates heme metabolism in human erythroid cells. We discovered that UCA1 expression is dynamically regulated during human erythroid maturation, with a maximal expression in proerythroblasts. UCA1 depletion predominantly impairs heme biosynthesis and arrests erythroid differentiation at the proerythroblast stage. Mechanistic analysis revealed that UCA1 physically interacts with the RNA-binding protein PTBP1, and UCA1 functions as an RNA scaffold to recruit PTBP1 to ALAS2 mRNA, which stabilizes ALAS2 mRNA.

29588542,Human cytomegalovirus reprograms hematopoietic progenitor cells into immunosuppressive monocyte to achieve latency,"The precise cell type hosting latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains elusive. Here, we report that HCMV reprogrammes human haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) into a unique monocyte subset to achieve latency. Unlike conventional monocytes, this monocyte subset possesses higher levels of B7-H4, IL-10 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a longer lifespan and strong immunosuppressive capacity. Cell sorting of peripheral blood from latently infected human donors confirms that only this monocyte subset, representing less than 0.1% of peripheral mononuclear cells, is HCMV genome-positive but immediate-early-negative. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that HCMV promotes the differentiation of HPCs into this monocyte subset by activating cellular signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In turn, this monocyte subset generates a high level of nitric oxide (NO) to silence HCMV immediate-early transcription and promote viral latency.

31217338,"We identified potential TCF4 targeted genes by performing CHIP-Seq using TCF4 antibody in ABC like DLBCL cell lines. We have identified strong binding of TCF4 to enhancer elements of B-cell receptor signaling components which drives B-cell receptor signaling.
SU-DHL-2 ABC-DLBCL cell lines with no TCF4 copy number gain was used to overexpress tetracyclin based TCF4 expression exogeneously. ChIP-Seq was performed 24 hours after tetracyclin treatment.","The activated B cell (ABC-like) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by chronic activation of signaling initiated by immunoglobulin μ (IgM). By analyzing the DNA copy number profiles of 1000 DLBCL tumors, we identified gains of 18q21.2 as the most frequent genetic alteration in ABC-like DLBCL. Using integrative analysis of matched gene expression profiling data, we found that the <i>TCF4</i> (<i>E2-2</i>) transcription factor gene was the target of these alterations. Overexpression of <i>TCF4</i> in ABC-like DLBCL cell lines led to its occupancy on immunoglobulin (<i>IGHM</i>) and <i>MYC</i> gene enhancers and increased expression of these genes at the transcript and protein levels. Inhibition of TCF4 activity with dominant-negative constructs was synthetically lethal to ABC-like DLBCL cell lines harboring <i>TCF4</i> DNA copy gains, highlighting these gains as an attractive potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, the <i>TCF4</i> gene was one of the top BRD4-regulated genes in DLBCL cell lines. BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) ARV771 extinguished TCF4, MYC, and IgM expression and killed ABC-like DLBCL cells in vitro. In DLBCL xenograft models, ARV771 treatment reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival. This work highlights a genetic mechanism for promoting immunoglobulin signaling in ABC-like DLBCL and provides a functional rationale for the use of BET inhibitors in this disease.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factor 4/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acid features (immunoglobulin gene structure)', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
31057546,"Purpose: The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome profiles of freshly isolated primary murine endothelial populations, namely the lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cell (LN-LEC) and blood endothelial cell (LN-BEC), and the diaphragm-derived LEC (D-LEC) in homeostasis.Methods: LN-LEC and LN-BEC total RNA samples were prepared by pooling inguinal, axillary, brachial, cervical, and mesenteric LNs from wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice (6-8 weeks of age, purchased from NCI), followed by mechanical and enzymatic digestion, CD45- cell lineage enrichment using MACS beads (deplete S protocol in AUTOMACS), and sorted by flow cytometry based on CD45, CD31, and podoplanin expressions using Influx (BD) into RNA Protect (Qiagen). D-LEC total RNA samples were prepared by mechanical and enzymatic digestion of tissues, followed directly by flow cytometry sorting as described above. Total RNA extraction was performed using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Genomic Services Laboratory at Hudson Alpha, USA. Briefly, purified total RNAs (RIN score of 7.0 or higher) were prepared for sequencing using the Ovation RNA-seq System V2 kit (Nugen) followed by RNA-sequencing of 100 paired-end reads using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 v4 platform. Raw RNA-sequencing read quality was assessed using FastQC and low quality regions were trimmed using Fastx-trimmer. Cleaned reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (build mm9) using STAR and read counts on known mouse genes were calculated using featureCounts, part of the Subread package. Next, uniquely aligned reads were analyzed using the DEseq2 package in the R statistical computing environment to obtain normalized counts, estimate dispersion, and determine a negative binomial model for each gene. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined using DESeq2 and the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate procedure was used to re-estimate the adjusted p-values. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subsequently identified as those with an FPKM of 1 or greater, p-adjusted < 0.05, and additionally 5X-DEG subsets were identified as those with fold-change of 5 or greater.Results: Post-sort analyses of LN-LEC, LN-BEC, and D-LEC replicates showed 92.6-98.6% purity. RNAseq yielded 48-98 million reads per replicate, with an average length of 180 nucleotides, and an average of 85.7% uniquely mapped reads. These reads mapped a total of 23284 genes, of which 15331 were considered expressed based on an average FPKM of 1 or greater in at least one cell type. Of this number, 14718, 14893, and 14384 genes were considered expressed in LN-LEC, LN-BEC, and D-LEC, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed that the transcriptional profiles of sample replicates clustered tightly, and that those of LN-LEC, LN-BEC, and D-LEC differed from each other.Conclusions: Our study provides insights into key genes involved in niche-associated functions of primary murine LEC and BEC in homeostasis. The RNA-seq data reported here may provide a conceptual framework for future comparative investigations of LN-LEC, LN-BEC, and D-LEC phenotypic expression profiles, heterogeneity, and niche-specific functions in homeostasis as well as disease.
mRNA profiles of 4 LN-LEC, 3 LN-BEC, and 3 D-LEC samples from wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice (6-8 weeks of age) were generated by RNA-sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 v4 platform.","Lymphatic and blood vessels are formed by specialized lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and blood endothelial cells (BEC), respectively. These endothelial populations not only form peripheral tissue vessels, but also critical supporting structures in secondary lymphoid organs, particularly the lymph node (LN). Lymph node LEC (LN-LEC) also have been shown to have important immunological functions that are not observed in LEC from tissue lymphatics. LN-LEC can maintain peripheral tolerance through direct presentation of self-antigen via MHC-I, leading to CD8 T cell deletion; and through transfer of self-antigen to dendritic cells for presentation via MHC-II, resulting in CD4 T cell anergy. LN-LEC also can capture and archive foreign antigens, transferring them to dendritic cells for maintenance of memory CD8 T cells. The molecular basis for these functional elaborations in LN-LEC remain largely unexplored, and it is also unclear whether blood endothelial cells in LN (LN-BEC) might express similar enhanced immunologic functionality. Here, we used RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptomic profiles of freshly isolated murine LEC and BEC from LN with one another and with freshly isolated LEC from the periphery (diaphragm). We show that LN-LEC, LN-BEC, and diaphragm LEC (D-LEC) are transcriptionally distinct from one another, demonstrating both lineage and tissue-specific functional specializations. Surprisingly, tissue microenvironment differences in gene expression profiles were more numerous than those determined by endothelial cell lineage specification. In this regard, both LN-localized endothelial cell populations show a variety of functional elaborations that suggest how they may function as antigen presenting cells, and also point to as yet unexplored roles in both positive and negative regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The present work has defined in depth gene expression differences that point to functional specializations of endothelial cell populations in different anatomical locations, but especially the LN. Beyond the analyses provided here, these data are a resource for future work to uncover mechanisms of endothelial cell functionality.","['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Blood Vessels/*cytology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Diaphragm/cytology', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/*cytology', 'Lymphatic Vessels/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA-Seq', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Over-representation data', 'Blot ID', 'BlotBase blot ID', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Keyword', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Gene expression matrix', 'CATH node', 'CATH node ID', 'SCOP node', 'Protein aliphatic index', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

29269040,Transcriptomic analysis to map mechanisms of viral replication control in HIV-1 positive Elite Controllers,"A small subset of HIV-1 infected individuals, the ""Elite Controllers"" (EC), can control viral replication and restrain progression to immunodeficiency without antiretroviral therapy (ART). In this study, a cross-sectional transcriptomics and targeted proteomics analysis were performed in a well-defined Swedish cohort of untreated EC (n=19), treatment naïve patients with viremia (VP, n=32) and HIV-1-negative healthy controls (HC, n=23). The blood transcriptome identified 151 protein-coding genes that were differentially expressed (DE) in VP compared to EC. Genes like CXCR6 and SIGLEC1 were downregulated in EC compared to VP. A definite distinction in gene expression between males and females among all patient-groups were observed. The gene expression profile between female EC and the healthy females was similar but did differ between male EC and healthy males. At targeted proteomics analysis, 90% (29/32) of VPs clustered together while EC and HC clustered separately from VP. Among the soluble factors, 33 were distinctive to be statistically significant (False discovery rate=0.02).

30358109,"A major unmet need in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the choice of treatment options for patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents (anti-TNF–IR). In order to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers and assess differential effects of TNF- and non–TNF-targeting agents on RA patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF–IR in comparison with biologic-naïve patients, peripheral protein markers and gene expression levels in association with clinical response posttreatment in two disease strata were assessed in disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-IR and anti-TNF-IR patients. Serum proteomics results indicated the existence of specific pharmacodynamic markers for golimumab and mavrilimumab, regardless of prior anti-TNF treatment. In contrast, both antibodies induced early and sustained suppression of RA disease markers, including IL-6, CRP, IL2RA, and MMP1, in DMARD-IR patients. Golimumab-induced early changes rapidly returned toward baseline concentrations in anti-TNF–IR patients, whereas mavrilimumab-induced changes were maintained through Day 169. RNA sequencing demonstrated gene expression changes at Day 169 after administration of mavrilimumab but not golimumab in anti-TNF–IR patients. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve and regression analysis showed the association of early IL-6 change and subsequent clinical responses to golimumab in anti-TNF-IR patients. Our results revealed golimumab- and mavrilimumab-specific pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and demonstrated differential biomarker-treatment relationships in anti-TNF–IR and DMARD-IR patients respectively. Early IL-6 change after anti-TNF antibody treatment may be a potential predictive biomarker for selection of different treatment regimens in anti-TNF-IR patients.
For RNAseq study, PAXgene whole blood tubes were collected from 75 DMARD-IR and 63 anti-TNF-IR RA patients at baseline and at day 169 of post-treatment by golimumab and marvrilimumab. Whole transcriptome profiles of these patients and 20 health donors were generated from RNAseq data.

In the present study, 2‑ and 3‑dimensional pressure‑loading systems were used to exert pressure on HepG2 and Huh‑7 cell lines.

In addition, Transwell, wound‑healing and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assays were applied to evaluate the migratory and invasive ability of pressurized cells. Analyses of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression profiles were performed to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, which were validated by RT‑qPCR. Bioinformatics analyses were subsequently performed to investigate the putative target genes and associated pathways. The proliferation and invasion of HepG2 and Huh‑7 cell lines were significantly increased under a pressure of 15 mmHg for 24 h.

The successive steps of cell morphogenesis correlate with the timing of the expression of cohorts of inter-related genes that have roles in generating the particular anatomical features of these cells, suggesting that a sequence of genetic regulomes govern stepwise cellular morphogenesis in this system.
12 samples with three replicates each are provided.  GFAP:GFP positive and negative cells were FAC sorted from wild type animals from each developmental stage","Cell shape is critical for the proper function of every cell in every tissue in the body. This is especially true for the highly morphologically diverse neural and glia cells of the central nervous system. The molecular processes by which these, or indeed any, cells gain their particular cell-specific morphology remain largely unexplored. To identify the genes involved in the morphogenesis of the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate retina, the Müller glia (MG), we used genomic and CRISPR based strategies in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We identified 41 genes involved in various aspects of MG cell morphogenesis and revealed a striking concordance between the sequential steps of anatomical feature addition and the expression of cohorts of functionally related genes that regulate these steps. We noted that the many of the genes preferentially expressed in zebrafish MG showed conservation in glia across species suggesting evolutionarily conserved glial developmental pathways.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/physiology', 'Ependymoglial Cells/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Morphogenesis/*physiology', 'Neurogenesis/*physiology', 'Neuroglia/*physiology', 'Transcriptome/*physiology', 'Zebrafish']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Sequence cluster ID (SYSTERS)', 'Gene cluster', 'Clustering', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Fish']"
32045043,"Website for easy exploration of the data: https://rna-seq-browser.herokuapp.com/#For the first time, we here characterize the transcriptional signature of satellite glial cells (SGCs) in a nerve injury-paradigm by isolating SGCs from mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) after peripheral nerve injury followed by next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).We found that SGCs regulate their gene expression differently at 3 days and 14 days after peripheral nerve injury suggesting that they change their function over time. At both time points, we found downregulation of several genes linked to cholesterol. After 14 days we further detect regulation of genes linked to the immune system (MHC protein complex and leukocyte migration).The SGC RNA-seq data is accompanied by RNA-seq of purified nociceptors from injured (partial sciatic nerve ligation) or sham (ipsi after sham operation or contra after partial sciatic nerve ligation) L3-L5 DRGs.
RNA was purified from naïve SGCs, naïve DRGs, SGCs 3 and 14 days after sciatic nerve ligation, SGCs 3 and 14 days after sham operation, nociceptors 8 days after partial sciatic nerve ligation and nociceptors 8 days after sham operation. The RNA was sequences with next generation sequencing (RNA-seq).The gene expression was compared in the following ways: naive SGCs vs naive DRG; SGCs 3 days after injury vs SGCs 3 days after sham; SGCs 14 days after injury vs SGCs 14 days after sham; nociceptors 8 days after injury vs nociceptors 8 days after sham.","Satellite glial cells (SGCs) are homeostatic cells enveloping the somata of peripheral sensory and autonomic neurons. A wide variety of neuronal stressors trigger activation of SGCs, contributing to, for example, neuropathic pain through modulation of neuronal activity. However, compared to neurons and other glial cells of the nervous system, SGCs have received modest scientific attention and very little is known about SGC biology, possibly due to the experimental challenges associated with studying them in vivo and in vitro. Utilizing a recently developed method to obtain SGC RNA from dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we took a systematic approach to characterize the SGC transcriptional fingerprint by using next-generation sequencing and, for the first time, obtain an overview of the SGC injury response. Our RNA sequencing data are easily accessible in supporting information in Excel format. They reveal that SGCs are enriched in genes related to the immune system and cell-to-cell communication. Analysis of SGC transcriptional changes in a nerve injury-paradigm reveal a differential response at 3 days versus 14 days postinjury, suggesting dynamic modulation of SGC function over time. Significant downregulation of several genes linked to cholesterol synthesis was observed at both time points. In contrast, regulation of gene clusters linked to the immune system (MHC protein complex and leukocyte migration) was mainly observed after 14 days. Finally, we demonstrate that, after nerve injury, macrophages are in closer physical proximity to both small and large DRG neurons, and that previously reported injury-induced proliferation of SGCs may, in fact, be proliferating macrophages.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuralgia/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Peripheral Nerve Injuries/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Satellite Cells, Perineuronal/*metabolism/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell line report', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Pain medicine', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Introns', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Microsatellites']"
32198457,"In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the switch that occurs from asexual multiplication to sexual differentiation is essential for transmission to mosquitos. One of the key drivers of commitment to sexual development is the transcription factor AP2-G. Although it has been hypothesised that AP2-G orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision by driving expression of gametocyte genes, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. We show conclusively that AP2-G is a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes and identify the earliest target genes expressed during commitment. Remarkably, we also find that in committed cells AP2-G is associated with the promoters of genes important for red blood cell invasion and activates them through its interactions with another transcription factor. We thus demonstrate for the first time an intriguing transcriptional link between the apparently opposing processes of red blood cell invasion and gametocytogenesis. This suggests that committed schizonts may have a distinct invasion preference or pathway that is transcriptionally regulated by AP2-G.
ChIP was performed on the AP2-G-DD::AP2-I-GFP line (+ Shld1) at the schizont stage using antibodies against GFP and HA. The input material served as the control. There are two biological replicates, giving a total of six samples.","In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the switch from asexual multiplication to sexual differentiation into gametocytes is essential for transmission to mosquitos. The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I.

Refer to individual Series","Copper (Cu) regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription activity by affecting the selectivity of HIF-1α binding to the promoters of affected genes. In hypoxia, Cu is required for HIF-1α binding to the promoter of BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), but the metal does not affect the binding of HIF-1α to the promoter of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Here, we made an effort to provide a comprehensive understanding of Cu regulation of the selectivity of HIF-1α binding across the genome. We used tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), a Cu selective chelator, to reduce Cu content in the cells. We conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to globally map the binding sites of HIF-1α, RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and the acetylation at the 27th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein (H3K27ac). We also performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in EA.hy926 cells under hypoxia (1% O2) with or without Cu depression to determine the profile of mRNA expression. Our analyses identified 3197 HIF-1α binding sites under hypoxia. Cu depression by TEPA reduced the number of binding sites to 1820 from the original 3197, but induced 274 new binding sites. We analysed these binding sites in the promoter and putative enhancer regions, coupled with their mRNA expression profiles, and found 281 Cu-dependent and 10 Cu-independent HIF-1α target genes. We found that the core bases ""GGAA"" and ""TTCC"" constituted the critical motifs for the binding sites of Cu-dependent genes. This study thus revealed that Cu, by affecting the binding of HIF-1α to the critical motifs in the promoter and putative enhancer regions of HIF-1 regulated genes, leads to the selectivity of HIF-1 regulated expression of Cu-dependent genes.","['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Copper', 'Ethylenediamines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism']","['Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna']"

28696287,Genomic architecture of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis,"Heterosis is most frequently manifested by the substantially increased vigorous growth of hybrids compared with their parents. Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include <i>WUSCHEL</i>, <i>ARGOS</i>, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative <i>Arabidopsis</i> hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus-responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Biomass', 'Genome, Plant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Hybrid Vigor']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'BIOM format', 'Biomaterials', 'Biomarkers', 'Plant biology', 'Genome map', 'Genome alignment', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Hybrid sequence alignment', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Hybrid sequence alignment construction']"

27984037,Induction of alternative proinflammatory cytokines accounts for sustained psoriasiform skin inflammation in IL-17C+IL-6KO mice [array],"IL-6 inhibition has been unsuccessful in treating psoriasis, despite high levels of tissue and serum IL-6 in patients. In addition, de novo psoriasis onset has been reported after IL-6 blockade in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To explore mechanisms underlying these clinical observations, we backcrossed an established psoriasiform mouse model (IL-17C+ mice) with IL-6-deficient mice (IL-17C+KO) and examined the cutaneous phenotype. IL-17C+KO mice initially exhibited decreased skin inflammation; however, this decrease was transient and reversed rapidly, concomitant with increases in skin Tnf, Il36α/β/γ, Il24, Epgn, and S100a8/a9 to levels higher than those found in IL-17C+ mice. A comparison of IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO mouse skin transcriptomes with that of human psoriasis skin revealed significant correlation among transcripts of skin of patients with psoriasis and IL-17C+KO mouse skin, and confirmed an exacerbation of the inflammatory signature in IL-17C+KO mice that aligns closely with human psoriasis. Transcriptional analyses of IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO primary keratinocytes confirmed increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, suggesting that in the absence of IL-6, keratinocytes increase production of numerous additional proinflammatory cytokines. These preclinical findings may provide insight into why patients with arthritis being treated with IL-6 inhibitors develop new onset psoriasis and why IL-6 blockade for the treatment of psoriasis has not been clinically effective.","['Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-17/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Psoriasis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism/*pathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Sequence masking']"

We found that IL-10 played an important role in connecting the function of M2 KCs to lipid accumulation and apoptosis in hepatocytes. Importantly, M2 polarization was controlled by a RORα activator, JC1-40, which improved symptoms of NASH. Our results suggest that the M2-promoting effects of RORα in liver macrophages may provide better therapeutic strategies against NASH.","['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diet, High-Fat/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Kupffer Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/etiology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor accession', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Metabolic disease']"
24640994,Genome-wide copy number variant discovery in dogs using the CanineHD genotyping array,"Substantial contribution to phenotypic diversity is accounted for by copy number variants (CNV). In human, as well as other species, the effect of CNVs range from benign to directly disease-causing which motivates the continued investigations of CNVs. Previous canine genome-wide screenings for CNVs have been performed using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridisation arrays which have contributed with a detailed catalogue of CNVs. Here, we present the first CNV investigation in dogs based on the recently reported CanineHD 170 K genotyping array. The hitherto largest dataset in canine CNV discovery was assessed, 351 dogs from 30 different breeds, enabling identification of novel CNVs and a thorough characterisation of breed-specific CNVs.","['Animals', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Disease Susceptibility/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Duplication', '*Genome', 'Genotype', '*Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'Genetic variation', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Duplication detection', 'Gene classification', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Genotyping', 'Genotyping experiment', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide']"
27170308,UNCOVERING VULVAR CARCINOMA: AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH [GE],"Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) is a rare disease that has a high mortality rate (∼40%). However, little is known about its molecular signature. Therefore, an integrated genomics approach, based on comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) and genome-wide expression (GWE) array, was performed to identify driver genes in VSCC. To achieve that, DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen VSCC clinical specimens and examined by aCGH and GWE array, respectively. On the basis of the integration of data using the CONEXIC algorithm, PLXDC2 and GNB3 were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of these genes was then analyzed by IHC in a large set of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. These analyses identified 47 putative drivers, 46 of which were characterized by copy number gains that were concomitant with overexpression and one with a copy number loss and downregulation. Two of these genes, PLXDC2 and GNB3, were selected for further validation: PLXDC2 was downregulated and GNB3 was overexpressed compared with non-neoplastic tissue. By IHC, both proteins were ubiquitously expressed throughout vulvar tissue. High expression of GNB3 and low PLXDC2 immunostaining in the same sample was significantly associated with less lymph node metastasis and greater disease-free survival. On the basis of a robust methodology never used before for VSCC evaluation, two novel prognostic markers in vulvar cancer are identified: one with favorable prognosis (GNB3) and the other with unfavorable prognosis (PLXDC2).","['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']","['Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Genome alignment']"
29272703,Genomic and proteomic resolution of heterochromatin and its restriction of alternate fate genes (ChIP-seq),"Heterochromatin is integral to cell identity maintenance by impeding the activation of genes for alternate cell fates. Heterochromatic regions are associated with histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or H3K27me3, but these modifications are also found in euchromatic regions that permit transcription. We discovered that resistance to sonication is a reliable indicator of the heterochromatin state, and we developed a biophysical method (gradient-seq) to discriminate subtypes of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) versus euchromatin. These classifications are more accurate than the histone marks alone in predicting transcriptional silence and resistance of alternate fate genes to activation during direct cell conversion. Our proteomics of H3K9me3-marked srHC and functional screens revealed diverse proteins, including RBMX and RBMXL1, that impede gene induction during cellular reprogramming. Isolation of srHC with gradient-seq provides a genome-wide map of chromatin structure, elucidating subtypes of repressed domains that are uniquely predictive of diverse other chromatin properties.","['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Heterochromatin/*genetics/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Proteomics/*methods']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Proteins', 'Chromosomes', 'protein', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome name', 'Mapping', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Genomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics']"

Here, we show that a small airway-on-a-chip device lined by living human bronchiolar epithelium from normal or COPD patients can be connected to an instrument that ""breathes"" whole cigarette smoke in and out of the chips to study smoke-induced pathophysiology in vitro. This technology enables true matched comparisons of biological responses by culturing cells from the same individual with or without smoke exposure. These studies led to identification of ciliary micropathologies, COPD-specific molecular signatures, and epithelial responses to smoke generated by electronic cigarettes.

27276681,Profiles of prostate cancer cell lines,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and second-most lethal cancer among men in the United States. The vast majority of prostate cancer deaths are due to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) - the lethal form of the disease that has progressed despite therapies that interfere with activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. One emergent resistance mechanism to medical castration is synthesis of intratumoral androgens that activate the AR. This insight led to the development of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. However, resistance to enzalutamide invariably develops, and disease progression is nearly universal. One mechanism of resistance to enzalutamide is an F877L mutation in the AR ligand-binding domain that can convert enzalutamide to an agonist of AR activity. However, mechanisms that contribute to the agonist switch had not been fully clarified, and there were no therapies to block AR F877L. Using cell line models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we determined that cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of mutant F877L AR. Further, enzalutamide treatment of AR F877L-expressing cell lines recapitulated the effects of androgen activation of F877L AR or wild-type AR. Because the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 was previously shown to block androgen activation of wild-type AR, we tested JQ-1 in AR F877L-expressing CRPC models. We determined that JQ-1 suppressed androgen or enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR and suppressed growth of mutant F877L AR CRPC tumors in vivo, demonstrating a new strategy to treat tumors harboring this mutation.","['Androgen Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Androgens/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitriles', 'Phenylthiohydantoin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']","['Pathogens', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'SMILES string', 'SMILES', 'Statistical calculation', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Epistasis', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Inhibitor combinations targeting both receptors and the dual inhibitor ponatinib suppress the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways leading to apoptosis. MRT cells that have acquired resistance to the PDGFRα inhibitor pazopanib are susceptible to FGFR inhibitors. We show that PDGFRα levels are regulated by SMARCB1 expression, and assessment of clinical specimens documents the expression of both PDGFRα and FGFR1 in rhabdoid tumor patients.

29177513,Chicken embryonic E16 scutate scale and feather samples,"The origin of feathers is an important question in Evo-Devo studies, with the eventual evolution of vaned feathers which are aerodynamic, allowing feathered dinosaurs and early birds to fly and venture into new ecological niches. Studying how feathers and scales are developmentally specified provides insight into how a new organ may evolve. We identified feather-associated genes using genomic analyses. The candidate genes were tested by expressing them in chicken and alligator scale forming regions. Ectopic expression of these genes induced intermediate morphotypes between scales and feathers which revealed several major morphogenetic events along this path: Localized growth zone formation, follicle invagination, epithelial branching, feather keratin differentiation, and dermal papilla formation. In addition to molecules known to induce feathers on scales (retinoic acid, β-catenin), we identified novel scale-feather converters (Sox2, Zic1, Grem1, Spry2, Sox18) which induce one or more regulatory modules guiding these morphogenetic events. Some morphotypes resemble filamentous appendages found in feathered dinosaur fossils, whereas others exhibit characteristics of modern avian feathers. We propose these morpho-regulatory modules were used to diversify archosaur scales and to initiate feather evolution. The regulatory combination and hierarchical integration may have led to the formation of extant feather forms. Our study highlights the importance of integrating discoveries between developmental biology and paleontology.","['Alligators and Crocodiles', '*Animal Scales', 'Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Chick Embryo', '*Feathers', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Morphogenesis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Transcription Factors', 'beta-Keratins/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Sequence features', 'Map feature', 'Gene structure', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Beta diversity data', 'Generation', 'Proteins']"
31611309,Transcriptome analysis of Caspase-3 deficient and proficient MCF-7 cells after docetaxel exposure,"Caspases are well known for their role in apoptosis. Recently, nonapoptotic roles of caspases have been identified, however, these noncanonical roles are not well documented and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here, we studied the role of cleaved caspase-3 using human- and mouse-proficient caspase-3 cancer cell lines and human-deficient caspase-3 cancer cells. Cleaved caspase-3 functioned as a transcription factor and directly bound to DNA. A DNA-binding domain was identified in the small subunit of caspase-3 and an active conformation was essential for caspase-3 transcriptional activity. Caspase-3 DNA binding enhanced angiogenesis by upregulating the expression of proangiogenic genes and by activating pathways that promoted endothelial cell activation. Some proapoptotic genes were downregulated in caspase-3-proficient cells. Inhibiting caspase-3 increased the efficacy of chemotherapy and decreased spontaneous tumor development. These data highlight a novel nonapoptotic role of caspase-3 and suggest that cleaved caspase-3 could be a new therapeutic target in cancer.

27809307,Effect of CCAR2 depletion on the gene expression profile of BJ-hTERT cells,"Human CCAR2 has recently emerged as having a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, promoting apoptosis and repair of heterochromatic DNA breaks. However, less is known about the function of CCAR2 in tumor formation and cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that CCAR2 loss inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, but preserves the growth of normal cells. Investigating the mechanisms responsible for this differential effect, we found that CCAR2 depletion specifically impairs the activation of AKT pathway in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, by reducing AKT phosphorylation on Ser473. This effect is achieved through the transcriptional upregulation of TRB3 gene and accumulation of TRB3 protein, which then binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. The defective activation of AKT finally results in reduced GSK3β phosphorylation, prevention of G1/S transition and inhibition of cancer cell growth. These results establish an important role for CCAR2 in cancer cells proliferation and could shed new light on novel therapeutic strategies against cancer, devoid of detrimental side effects.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'S Phase', '*Signal Transduction']","['Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein signature', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Phasing', 'Translation phase specification', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein threading', 'Protein databases', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein expression', 'Protein report', 'Database', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

Yellowjackets and hornets constitute one of the only two lineages of highly eusocial wasps, and the distribution of key behavioral traits correlates closely with the current classification of the group. The potential of the Vespinae to elucidate the evolution of social life, however, remains limited due to ambiguous genus-level relationships. Here, we address the relationships among genera within the Vespinae using transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data. We sequenced the transcriptomes of six vespid wasps, including three of the four genera recognized in the Vespinae, combined our data with publicly available transcriptomes, and assembled two matrices comprising 1,507 and 3,356 putative single-copy genes. The results of our phylogenomic analyses recover Dolichovespula as more closely related to Vespa than to Vespula, therefore challenging the prevailing hypothesis of yellowjacket (Vespula+Dolichovespula) monophyly. This suggests that traits such as large colony size and high paternity arose in the genus Vespula following its early divergence from the remaining vespine genera.","['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Wasps/*classification/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'Protein complex', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'PS']"
24740065,Domains of genomewide gene expression dysregulation in Down syndrome [RRBS],"Trisomy 21 is the most frequent genetic cause of cognitive impairment. To assess the perturbations of gene expression in trisomy 21, and to eliminate the noise of genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either upregulated or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins' fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down's syndrome and normal littermate mouse fibroblasts also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina-associated (LADs) and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall position of LADs was not altered in trisomic cells; however, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results indicate that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome, and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some trisomy 21 phenotypes.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Transcriptome/*genetics', 'Twins, Monozygotic/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'DNA', 'R markdown', 'Job status', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Analysis', 'MAT', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcriptomics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

However, the current phylogeny of bifidobacteria is hampered by the relative paucity of genotypic data. Here, we reassessed the taxonomy of this bacterial genus using genome-based approaches, which demonstrated that the previous taxonomic view of bifidobacteria contained several inconsistencies. In particular, high levels of genetic relatedness were shown to exist between particular Bifidobacterium taxa which would not justify their status as separate species. The results presented are here based on average nucleotide identity analysis involving the genome sequences for each type strain of the 48 bifidobacterial taxa, as well as phylogenetic comparative analysis of the predicted core genome of the Bifidobacterium genus.

25057852,Integrative Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Identified Candidate Genes Implicated in the Pathogenesis of Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma,"Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is an aggressive lymphoma cytogenetically characterized by isochromosome 7q [i(7)(q10)], of which the molecular consequences remain unknown. We report here results of an integrative genomic and transcriptomic (expression microarray and RNA-sequencing) study of six i(7)(q10)-positive HSTL cases, including HSTL-derived cell line (DERL-2), and three cases with ring 7 [r(7)], the recently identified rare variant aberration. Using high resolution array CGH, we profiled all cases and mapped the common deleted region (CDR) at 7p22.1p14.1 (34.88 Mb; 3506316-38406226 bp) and the common gained region (CGR) at 7q22.11q31.1 (38.77 Mb; 86259620-124892276 bp). Interestingly, CDR spans a smaller region of 13 Mb (86259620-99271246 bp) constantly amplified in cases with r(7). In addition, we found that TCRG (7p14.1) and TCRB (7q32) are involved in formation of r(7), which seems to be a byproduct of illegitimate somatic rearrangement of both loci. Further transcriptomic analysis has not identified any CDR-related candidate tumor suppressor gene. Instead, loss of 7p22.1p14.1 correlated with an enhanced expression of CHN2 (7p14.1) and the encoded β2-chimerin. Gain and amplification of 7q22.11q31.1 are associated with an increased expression of several genes postulated to be implicated in cancer, including RUNDC3B, PPP1R9A and ABCB1, a known multidrug resistance gene. RNA-sequencing did not identify any disease-defining mutation or gene fusion. Thus, chromosome 7 imbalances remain the only driver events detected in this tumor. We hypothesize that the Δ7p22.1p14.1-associated enhanced expression of CHN2/β2-chimerin leads to downmodulation of the NFAT pathway and a proliferative response, while upregulation of the CGR-related genes provides growth advantage for neoplastic δγT-cells and underlies their intrinsic chemoresistance. Finally, our study confirms the previously described gene expression profile of HSTL and identifies a set of 24 genes, including three located on chromosome 7 (CHN2, ABCB1 and PPP1R9A), distinguishing HSTL from other malignancies.","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chimerin Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptome']","['Gene family report', 'Protein family report', 'RNA family report', 'Scents', 'Scent annotation', 'Paediatrics', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'Protein chain', 'Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosome report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'MAT', 'Protein alignment', 'Protein domains', 'Biobank', 'Transcriptomics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

There is an urgent unmet need to develop sensitive and specific biomarkers for the early detection of prostate cancer to reduce overtreatment and accompanying morbidity. We identified a group of differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples and further characterized six long noncoding RNAs (AK024556, XLOC_007697, LOC100287482, XLOC_005327, XLOC_008559, and XLOC_009911) in prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples (Gleason score >6.0) and compared them with matched normal (healthy) tissues. Interestingly, these markers were also successfully detected in patient urine samples and were found to be up-regulated when compared with normal (healthy) urine. AK024556 (SPRY4-IT1) was highly up-regulated in human prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in LNCaP, and siRNA knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 in PC3 cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and increased cell apoptosis. Chromogenic in situ hybridization assay was developed to detect long noncoding RNAs in primary prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples, paving the way for clinical diagnostics. We believe that these results will set the stage for more extensive studies to develop novel long noncoding RNA-based diagnostic assays for early prostate cancer detection and will help to distinguish benign prostate cancer from precancerous lesions.","['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']","['Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'MAT', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA']"
24768051,Hofstenia miamia Transcriptome,"Whole-body regeneration is widespread in the Metazoa, yet little is known about how underlying molecular mechanisms compare across phyla. Acoels are an enigmatic phylum of invertebrate worms that can be highly informative about many questions in bilaterian evolution, including regeneration. We developed the three-banded panther worm, Hofstenia miamia, as a new acoelomorph model system for molecular studies of regeneration. Hofstenia were readily cultured, with accessible embryos, juveniles, and adults for experimentation. We developed molecular resources and tools for Hofstenia, including a transcriptome and robust systemic RNAi. We report the identification of molecular mechanisms that promote whole-body regeneration in Hofstenia. Wnt signaling controls regeneration of the anterior-posterior axis, and Bmp-Admp signaling controls regeneration of the dorsal-ventral axis. Perturbation of these pathways resulted in regeneration-abnormal phenotypes involving axial feature duplication, such as the regeneration of two heads following Wnt perturbation or the regeneration of ventral cells in place of dorsal ones following bmp or admp RNAi. Hofstenia regenerative mechanisms are strikingly similar to those guiding regeneration in planarians. However, phylogenetic analyses using the Hofstenia transcriptome support an early branching position for acoels among bilaterians, with the last common ancestor of acoels and planarians being the ancestor of the Bilateria. Therefore, these findings identify similar whole-body regeneration mechanisms in animals separated by more than 550 million years of evolution.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Platyhelminths/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regeneration', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Genetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Mathematics', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Citation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Protein domains']"

29121515,Sequencing Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of dairy origins,"Diacetyl and the closely related compound acetoin impart desirable buttery flavour and odour to many foods including cheese and are generated through the metabolism of citrate by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To increase the levels of these compounds, adjunct cultures capable of producing them can be added to cheese fermentations. In this study, we compared the diacetyl and acetoin producing abilities of 13 Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains from cheese sources. Diacetyl and acetoin production was found to be a common feature of Lb. rhamnosus grown in milk, with 12 strains producing these compounds. Whole genome sequencing of four strains revealed that genes encoding the citrate metabolising pathway present in other LAB are conserved in Lb. rhamnosus. One strain was, however, totally defective in diacetyl and acetoin production. This was likely due to an inability to produce the diacetyl/acetoin precursor compound acetolactate resulting from a frameshift mutation in the acetolactate synthase (als) gene. Complementation of this defective strain with a complete als gene from a diacetyl producing strain restored production of diacetyl and acetoin to levels equivalent to naturally high producing strains. Introduction of the same als-containing plasmid into the probiotic Lb. rhamnosus strain GG also increased diacetyl and acetoin levels. In model cheesemaking experiments, the als-complemented strain produced very high levels of diacetyl and acetoin over 35days of ripening. These findings identify the genetic basis for natural variation in production of a key cheese flavour compound in Lb. rhamnosus strains.","['Acetoin/*metabolism', 'Acetolactate Synthase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cheese/*microbiology', 'Citric Acid/metabolism', 'Diacetyl/*metabolism', 'Fermentation', 'Flavoring Agents/metabolism', 'Food Microbiology', 'Genome, Bacterial/genetics', 'Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus/classification/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Milk/*microbiology', 'Probiotics', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/analysis']","['ACE', 'Synthetic biology', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chemical name (ChEBI)', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Reaction data', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biology', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Gene name (Bacillus subtilis)', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound name', 'Compound accession']"
25143114,Subglacial Lake Whillans Metagenome,"Liquid water has been known to occur beneath the Antarctic ice sheet for more than 40 years, but only recently have these subglacial aqueous environments been recognized as microbial ecosystems that may influence biogeochemical transformations on a global scale. Here we present the first geomicrobiological description of water and surficial sediments obtained from direct sampling of a subglacial Antarctic lake. Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) lies beneath approximately 800 m of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network. The water column of SLW contained metabolically active microorganisms and was derived primarily from glacial ice melt with solute sources from lithogenic weathering and a minor seawater component. Heterotrophic and autotrophic production data together with small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and biogeochemical data indicate that SLW is a chemosynthetically driven ecosystem inhabited by a diverse assemblage of bacteria and archaea. Our results confirm that aquatic environments beneath the Antarctic ice sheet support viable microbial ecosystems, corroborating previous reports suggesting that they contain globally relevant pools of carbon and microbes that can mobilize elements from the lithosphere and influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems.","['Antarctic Regions', 'Aquatic Organisms/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Archaea/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Bacteria/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Carbon/metabolism', '*Ecosystem', 'Geologic Sediments/chemistry/microbiology', '*Ice Cover/chemistry', 'Lakes/chemistry/*microbiology', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Phylogeny']","['Coding region', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Coding region prediction', 'Model organisms', 'Genetic organisation', 'Organism name', 'Prokaryotes and Archaea', 'CATH architecture', 'Database search', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate accession', 'GTrack', 'GSuite', 'BTrack', 'Service discovery', 'Sequence motif discovery', 'Indel detection', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction']"
34529467,"Inflammation is a major risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). When occurring in the context of pancreatitis, mutations of KRAS accelerate tumor development. We discovered that long after its complete resolution, a transient inflammatory event primes pancreatic epithelial cells to subsequent transformation by oncogenic KRAS.

Such adaptation enables the prompt reactivation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) upon subsequent inflammatory events, thus efficiently limiting tissue damage via rapid decrease of zymogen production. We propose that since activating mutations of KRAS maintain an irreversible ADM, they may be beneficial and under strong positive selection in the context of recurrent pancreatitis.

32123031,"The nuclear receptor HNF4alpha is regulating a wide set of genes associated with development, cell differentiation, inflammation and metabolism. In human, 12 variants of HNF4α  can be expressed by the use of two promoters and by alternative splicing. Until now, the characterization of this transcription factor has ignored this diversity and has remained confined to the study of a fraction of the isoforms. We therefore wanted to clarify the situation by specifically characterizing the transcriptional functions of the 12 isoforms of HNF4α. We have generated for this purpose stable lines expressing each isoform of HNF4α in HCT 116 cells. The expression of each isoform was then induced for 48 hours and the whole transcriptome was analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome associated with each specific isoform was then compared to empty control cells to determine the specific transcriptional functions of HNF4alpha's isoforms.
Stable HCT116 cell lines containing a single insertion of the different human HNF4alpha isoforms (1 to 12) fused to GFP at its C-terminal were generated through the Flp-In T-REx system. Expression of HNF4alpha isoforms was induced for 48 hours with 2.5 ug/ml of doxycycline before analyzing the transcriptome by RNA sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. Experiments were realized in triplicate for all isoforms of HNF4alpha and transcripts expression was compared to the one of the parental empty HCT116 cell line.","HNF4α is a nuclear receptor produced as 12 isoforms from two promoters by alternative splicing. To characterize the transcriptional capacities of all 12 HNF4α isoforms, stable lines expressing each isoform were generated. The entire transcriptome associated with each isoform was analyzed as well as their respective interacting proteome. Major differences were noted in the transcriptional function of these isoforms. The α1 and α2 isoforms were the strongest regulators of gene expression whereas the α3 isoform exhibited significantly reduced activity. The α4, α5, and α6 isoforms, which use an alternative first exon, were characterized for the first time, and showed a greatly reduced transcriptional potential with an inability to recognize the consensus response element of HNF4α. Several transcription factors and coregulators were identified as potential specific partners for certain HNF4α isoforms. An analysis integrating the vast amount of omics data enabled the identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms specific to certain HNF4α isoforms, hence demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms given their seemingly diverse functions.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome/genetics']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'Plasmid map', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

The underlying mechanism is linked to elevated IL-6 concomitant with neoplasia. Neutralization of IL-6 in vivo ameliorates cDC1 apoptosis, rescuing cDC1 abundance in tumor-bearing mice. CD8+ T cell response to vaccination is impaired as a result of cDC1 dysregulation. Yet, combination therapy with CD40 agonist and Flt3 ligand restores cDC1 abundance to normal levels, decreases cDC1 apoptosis, and repairs cDC1 maturation to drive superior control of tumor outgrowth. Our study therefore reveals the unexpectedly early and systemic onset of cDC1 dysregulation during pancreatic carcinogenesis and suggests therapeutically tractable strategies toward cDC1 repair.","['Aged', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/pathology']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Protein active sites', 'Sequence position', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'SAGE experimental data']"

30270498,Gene targets and developmental regulation of the honeybee Apis mellifera ftz-f1,"Ftz-f1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. A 20-hydroxyecdysone pulse allows ftz-f1 gene expression, which then regulates the activity of downstream genes involved in major developmental progression events. In honeybees, the expression of genes like vitellogenin (vg), prophenoloxidase and juvenile hormone-esterase during late pharate-adult development is known to be hormonally controlled in both queens and workers by increasing juvenile hormone (JH) titres in the presence of declining levels of ecdysteroids. Since Ftz-f1 is known for mediating intracellular JH signalling, we hypothesized that ftz-f1 could mediate JH action during the pharate-adult development of honeybees, thus controlling the expression of these genes. Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression. Finally, a double-repressor hypothesis-inspired vg gene knock-down experiment suggests the existence of a positive molecular loop between JH, ftz-f1 and vg.","['Animals', 'Bees/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Insect Proteins/metabolism', 'Juvenile Hormones/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Interference', 'Vitellogenins/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BED', 'BEL', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Citation']"

However, the role of miRNAs in the host response against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection is not clear. In this study, we show that the expression of a series of miRNAs was significantly altered in DF-1 cells after IBDV infection.

34721430,"Several mechanisms have been implicated in MDSC-mediated suppression of immune responses. To better understand the mechanism(s)/pathway(s) MDSCs utilize to suppress immune responses, we performed a transcriptome profiling of CD11b+CD11c+ (good suppressors) and CD11b+CD11c- (poor suppressors) MDSCs. Comparison of the respective transcriptomes allowed us to identify target genes associated with immunosuppression.
Here we analyse in vitro generated myeloid-derived supressor cells (MDSCs) separated into two populations – CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c- with six replicates each for a total of 12 RNA-Seq samples.","Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid progenitor cells that dampen overwhelming adaptive immune responses through multiple mechanisms and are recognized as an attractive novel immune intervention therapy for counteracting the destructive effects of graft- <i>versus</i> -host disease (GVHD) developing after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). MDSCs can be produced in great numbers for cellular therapy, but they present a mixture of subsets whose functions in GVHD prevention are undefined. Here, we generated MDSCs <i>in vitro</i> from murine BM cells in the presence of GM-CSF and defined the integrin CD11c as a marker to subdivide MDSCs into two functional subgroups: CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs. Isolated CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs both inhibited alloantigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation <i>in vitro</i>, although CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs were more efficient and expressed higher levels of different immunosuppressive molecules. Likewise, expression of surface markers such as MHC class II, CD80, CD86, or PD-L1 further delineated both subsets. Most importantly, only the adoptive transfer of CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs into a single MHC class I-disparate allogeneic BMT model prevented GVHD development and strongly decreased disease-induced mortality, while CD11b+CD11c- MDSCs were totally ineffective. Surprisingly, allogeneic T-cell homing and expansion in lymphatic and GVHD target organs were not affected by cotransplanted CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs indicating a clear contradiction between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> functions of MDSCs. However, CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs shifted immune responses towards type 2 immunity reflected by increased Th2-specific cytokine expression of allogeneic T cells. Induction of type 2 immunity was mandatory for GVHD prevention, since CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs were ineffective if recipients were reconstituted with STAT6-deficient T cells unable to differentiate into Th2 cells. Most importantly, the beneficial graft- <i>versus</i> -tumor (GVT) effect was maintained in the presence of CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs since syngeneic tumor cells were efficiently eradicated. Strong differences in the transcriptomic landscape of both subpopulations underlined their functional differences. Defining CD11b+CD11c+ MDSCs as the subset of <i>in vitro</i>-generated MDSCs able to inhibit GVHD development might help to increase efficiency of MDSC therapy and to further delineate relevant target molecules and signaling pathways responsible for GVHD prevention.","['Allografts', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'CD11 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD11b Antigen/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Ontology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/chemistry/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transcriptome']","['X-ray diffraction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transposon prediction', 'Gene transcript report', 'Transition matrix', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'GEN', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Tumor annotation', 'Variant effect prediction', 'Cellular process pathways', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'MRI', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Chimera detection', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'Feature selection', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

WAGO-1 silences certain genes, transposons, pseudogenes, and cryptic loci. Finally, we demonstrate that components of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway function in at least one WAGO-mediated surveillance pathway.

Microglia quickly reduced, and peripheral myeloid cells infiltrated three days-post-injury (dpi). At 14 dpi, microglia repopulated, myeloid cells were reduced, and lymphocytes infiltrated. Importantly, genetic lineage tracing of nestin<sup>+</sup> and Cx3cr1<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo showed that the repopulation of microglia was derived from residual microglia after SCI. We found that residual microglia regress to a developmental growth state in the early stages after SCI. Hif1α promotes microglial proliferation. Conditional ablation of Hif1α in microglia causes larger lesion sizes, fewer axon fibers, and impaired functional recovery in the late stages after SCI. Our results mapped the immune heterogeneity in SCI and raised the possibility that targeting Hif1α may help in axon regeneration and functional recovery after SCI.","['Animals', 'Axons/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', '*Microglia/pathology', 'Nerve Regeneration/genetics', '*Spinal Cord Injuries/pathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'Introns', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'EM Micrograph', 'Microbiology', 'RNA annotation format', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Report']"

30901352,"Host innate immune defences play a critical role in restricting the intracellular propagation and pathogenesis of invading viral pathogens. Here we show that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) associates with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) to stimulate the induction of innate immune defences against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Following the activation of innate immune signalling, HIRA localized at PML-NBs in a Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK), Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK), and Sp100-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis revealed that HIRA promoted the transcriptional upregulation of a broad repertoire of host genes that regulate innate immunity to HSV-1 infection, including those involved in MHC-I antigen presentation, cytokine signalling, and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that PML, the principle scaffolding protein of PML-NBs, was required for the enrichment of HIRA onto ISGs, identifying a role for PML in the HIRA-dependent regulation of innate immunity to virus infection. Our data identifies independent roles for HIRA in the intrinsic silencing of viral gene expression and the induction of innate immune defences to restrict the initiation and propagation of HSV-1 infection, respectively. These intracellular host defences are antagonized by the HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which disrupts the stable recruitment of HIRA to infecting viral genomes and PML-NBs at spatiotemporally distinct phases of infection. Our study highlights the importance of histone chaperones to regulate multiple phases of intracellular immunity to virus infection, findings that are likely to be highly pertinent in the cellular restriction of many clinically important viral pathogens.

However, problems remain with issues such as acquisition of chemoresistance against GEM. GEM is activated after phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) inside of the cell; thus, DCK inactivation is one of the important mechanisms for acquisition of GEM resistance. We previously investigated the DCK gene in multiple GEM resistant cancer cell lines and identified frequent inactivating mutations. In this study, we identified two crucial genetic alteration in DCK. (1) A total deletion of DCK in RTGBC1-TKB, an acquired GEM resistant cell line derived from a gall bladder cancer cell line TGBC1-TKB. (2) An E197K missense alteration of DCK in MKN28, a gastric cancer cell line; its acquired GEM resistant cancer cell line, RMKN28, showed a loss of the normal E197 allele. We introduced either normal DCK or altered DCK_E197K into RMKN28 and proved that only the introduction of normal DCK restored GEM sensitivity. Furthermore, we analyzed 104 healthy volunteers and found that none of them carried the same base substitution observed in MKN28. These results strongly suggest that (1) the E197K alteration in DCK causes inactivation of DCK, and that (2) loss of the normal E197 allele is the crucial mechanism in acquisition of GEM resistance in RMKN28.","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Gemcitabine']","['Comparison matrix (amino acid)', 'DNA substitution model', 'Comparison matrix', 'Plant biology', 'DNA testing', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence data', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'Analysis', 'Function analysis', 'Map', 'Kinase name', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Exons', 'Exome sequencing', 'Introns', 'Citation', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type']"

However, little is known about the target genes that explain leukemogenesis in these mice. In this study we found that immature B cells were altered in frequency in the bone marrow of preleukemic CD19-CreΔPB mice. Enriched pro-B cells from CD19-CreΔPB mice induced disease upon transplantation, suggesting that these were leukemia-initiating cells. Bone marrow cells from preleukemic CD19-CreΔPB mice had increased responsiveness to IL-7 and could proliferate indefinitely in response to this cytokine. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a negative regulator of IL-7 signaling, was reduced in preleukemic and leukemic CD19-CreΔPB cells compared with controls. Induction of PU.1 expression in cultured CD19-CreΔPB pro-B cell lines induced Btk expression, followed by reduced STAT5 phosphorylation and early apoptosis. PU.1 and Spi-B regulated Btk directly as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Ectopic expression of BTK was sufficient to induce apoptosis in cultured pro-B cells. In summary, these results suggest that PU.1 and Spi-B activate Btk to oppose IL-7 responsiveness in developing B cells.","['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Interleukin-7/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*immunology']","['Kinase name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequence', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor accession']"
24962140,"M-CSF priming of osteoclast precursors can cause osteoclastogenesis-insensitivity, which can be prevented and overcome on bone","Osteoclasts and macrophages share progenitors that must receive decisive lineage signals driving them into their respective differentiation routes. Macrophage colony stimulation factor M-CSF is a common factor; bone is likely the stimulus for osteoclast differentiation. To elucidate the effect of both, shared mouse bone marrow precursor myeloid blast was pre-cultured with M-CSF on plastic and on bone. M-CSF priming prior to stimulation with M-CSF and osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL resulted in a complete loss of osteoclastogenic potential without bone. Such M-CSF primed cells expressed the receptor RANK, but lacked the crucial osteoclastogenic transcription factor NFATc1. This coincided with a steeply decreased expression of osteoclast genes TRACP and DC-STAMP, but an increased expression of the macrophage markers F4/80 and CD11b. Compellingly, M-CSF priming on bone accelerated the osteoclastogenic potential: M-CSF primed cells that had received only one day M-CSF and RANKL and were grown on bone already expressed an array of genes that are associated with osteoclast differentiation and these cells differentiated into osteoclasts within 2 days. Osteoclastogenesis-insensitive precursors grown in the absence of bone regained their osteoclastogenic potential when transferred to bone. This implies that adhesion to bone dictates the fate of osteoclast precursors. Common macrophage-osteoclast precursors may become insensitive to differentiate into osteoclasts and regain osteoclastogenesis when bound to bone or when in the vicinity of bone.","['Acid Phosphatase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone and Bones/cytology', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'RANK Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']","['Phosphorylation sites', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Database ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Backbone modelling', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'GEN', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Enzymes', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Simulation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Proteogenomics', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'Biological system modelling']"
24951784,Transcriptional response of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 to Galactose,"Comparison of the transcriptome of Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39 grown in the presence of either lactose or galactose with that of the strain grown in the presence of glucose revealed the elevated expression of various genes and operons, including the lac gene cluster, which is organized into two operons, i.e., lac operon I (lacABCD) and lac operon II (lacTFEG). Deletion of the DeoR family transcriptional regulator lacR that is present downstream of the lac gene cluster revealed elevated expression of lac operon I even in the absence of lactose. This suggests a function of LacR as a transcriptional repressor of lac operon I, which encodes enzymes involved in the phosphorylated tagatose pathway in the absence of lactose or galactose. Deletion of lacR did not affect the expression of lac operon II, which encodes a lactose-specific phosphotransferase. This finding was further confirmed by β-galactosidase assays with PlacA-lacZ and PlacT-lacZ in the presence of either lactose or glucose as the sole carbon source in the medium. This suggests the involvement of another transcriptional regulator in the regulation of lac operon II, which is the BglG-family transcriptional antiterminator LacT.

24958854,Gene expression changes after loss of Hoxa9 in transformed HSCs [HOXA9 RNA-seq],"Homeobox A9 (HOXA9) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a key role in hematopoietic stem cell expansion and is commonly deregulated in human acute leukemias. A variety of upstream genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lead to overexpression of HOXA9, almost always in association with overexpression of its cofactor meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1) . A wide range of data suggests that HOXA9 and MEIS1 play a synergistic causative role in AML, although the molecular mechanisms leading to transformation by HOXA9 and MEIS1 remain elusive. In this study, we identify CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) as a critical collaborator required for Hoxa9/Meis1-mediated leukemogenesis. We show that C/EBPα is required for the proliferation of Hoxa9/Meis1-transformed cells in culture and that loss of C/EBPα greatly improves survival in both primary and secondary murine models of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemia. Over 50% of Hoxa9 genome-wide binding sites are cobound by C/EBPα, which coregulates a number of downstream target genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation.

28343967,The 1KITE project: evolution of insects,"Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family ""Crabronidae."" Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles.","['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Hymenoptera/*classification/genetics/physiology', 'Insect Proteins/*genetics', 'Phylogeny']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction']"
24965474,RNA-Seq analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells infected with PhiKZ phage,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage ϕKZ is the type representative of the giant phage genus, which is characterized by unusually large virions and genomes. By unraveling the transcriptional map of the ∼ 280-kb ϕKZ genome to single-nucleotide resolution, we combine 369 ϕKZ genes into 134 operons. Early transcription is initiated from highly conserved AT-rich promoters distributed across the ϕKZ genome and located on the same strand of the genome. Early transcription does not require phage or host protein synthesis. Transcription of middle and late genes is dependent on protein synthesis and mediated by poorly conserved middle and late promoters. Unique to ϕKZ is its ability to complete its infection in the absence of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) enzyme activity. We propose that transcription of the ϕKZ genome is performed by the consecutive action of two ϕKZ-encoded, noncanonical multisubunit RNAPs, one of which is packed within the virion, another being the product of early genes. This unique, rifampin-resistant transcriptional machinery is conserved within the diverse giant phage genus.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bacteriophages/enzymology/genetics/*growth & development/physiology', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Pseudomonas Phages/enzymology/genetics/*growth & development/physiology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*enzymology/genetics/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'RNA', 'rna', 'DNA', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Protein domains', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Virus annotation', 'Virus identifier']"

Here, by integrating RNA-seq with p53 ChIP-seq analyses of a human cancer cell line under DNA damage, we define a high-confidence set of 18 lncRNAs that are p53 transcriptional targets. We demonstrate that two of the p53-regulated lncRNAs are required for the efficient binding of p53 to some of its target genes, modulating the p53 transcriptional network and contributing to apoptosis induction by DNA damage. We also show that the expression of p53-lncRNAs is lowered in colorectal cancer samples, constituting a tumour suppressor signature with high diagnostic power. Thus, p53-regulated lncRNAs establish a positive regulatory feedback loop that enhances p53 tumour suppressor activity. Furthermore, the signature defined by p53-regulated lncRNAs supports their potential use in the clinic as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","['Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']","['Color', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Tumor annotation', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA', 'protein', 'Protein expression']"
25203323,"The splicing factor RBM4 controls apoptosis, proliferation, and migration to suppress tumor progression","Splicing dysregulation is one of the molecular hallmarks of cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we report that the splicing factor RBM4 suppresses proliferation and migration of various cancer cells by specifically controlling cancer-related splicing. Particularly, RBM4 regulates Bcl-x splicing to induce apoptosis, and coexpression of Bcl-xL partially reverses the RBM4-mediated tumor suppression. Moreover, RBM4 antagonizes an oncogenic splicing factor, SRSF1, to inhibit mTOR activation. Strikingly, RBM4 expression is decreased dramatically in cancer patients, and the RBM4 level correlates positively with improved survival. In addition to providing mechanistic insights of cancer-related splicing dysregulation, this study establishes RBM4 as a tumor suppressor with therapeutic potential and clinical values as a prognostic factor.","['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Statistical estimate score', 'Copy number estimation', 'Multiple testing correction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA translation', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Splicing analysis', 'Kinase name', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Protein data', 'Protein name']"
31554818,High-fat diet fuels prostate cancer progression by rewiring the metabolome and amplifying the MYC program,"Systemic metabolic alterations associated with increased consumption of saturated fat and obesity are linked with increased risk of prostate cancer progression and mortality, but the molecular underpinnings of this association are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in a murine prostate cancer model, that high-fat diet (HFD) enhances the MYC transcriptional program through metabolic alterations that favour histone H4K20 hypomethylation at the promoter regions of MYC regulated genes, leading to increased cellular proliferation and tumour burden. Saturated fat intake (SFI) is also associated with an enhanced MYC transcriptional signature in prostate cancer patients. The SFI-induced MYC signature independently predicts prostate cancer progression and death. Finally, switching from a high-fat to a low-fat diet, attenuates the MYC transcriptional program in mice. Our findings suggest that in primary prostate cancer, dietary SFI contributes to tumour progression by mimicking MYC over expression, setting the stage for therapeutic approaches involving changes to the diet.","['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolome/*drug effects', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Metabolomics', 'Metabolites', 'Metabolic disease', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data']"
28850031,Repression by PRDM13 is critical for generating precise neuronal identity,"The mechanisms that activate some genes while silencing others are critical to ensure precision in lineage specification as multipotent progenitors become restricted in cell fate. During neurodevelopment, these mechanisms are required to generate the diversity of neuronal subtypes found in the nervous system. Here we report interactions between basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activators and the transcriptional repressor PRDM13 that are critical for specifying dorsal spinal cord neurons. PRDM13 inhibits gene expression programs for excitatory neuronal lineages in the dorsal neural tube. Strikingly, PRDM13 also ensures a battery of ventral neural tube specification genes such as <i>Olig1</i>, <i>Olig2</i> and <i>Prdm12</i> are excluded dorsally. PRDM13 does this via recruitment to chromatin by multiple neural bHLH factors to restrict gene expression in specific neuronal lineages. Together these findings highlight the function of PRDM13 in repressing the activity of bHLH transcriptional activators that together are required to achieve precise neuronal specification during mouse development.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Chick Embryo', 'Embryo, Mammalian', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interneurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Motor Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neural Tube/cytology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/*genetics', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene report', 'Report', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Protein alignment', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Gramene secondary identifier', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Biobank', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structure clustering', 'Structural data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Data', 'Sequence record']"

Refer to individual Series","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and caused the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in part because of its ability to effectively suppress host cell responses<sup>1-3</sup>. In rare cases, viral proteins dampen antiviral responses by mimicking critical regions of human histone proteins<sup>4-8</sup>, particularly those containing post-translational modifications required for transcriptional regulation<sup>9-11</sup>. Recent work has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 markedly disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation<sup>12-14</sup>. However, how SARS-CoV-2 controls the host cell epigenome and whether it uses histone mimicry to do so remain unclear. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by ORF8 (ORF8) functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motifs in histone H3 to disrupt host cell epigenetic regulation. ORF8 is associated with chromatin, disrupts regulation of critical histone post-translational modifications and promotes chromatin compaction. Deletion of either the ORF8 gene or the histone mimic site attenuates the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt host cell chromatin, affects the transcriptional response to infection and attenuates viral genome copy number. These findings demonstrate a new function of ORF8 and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Further, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19.","['*COVID-19/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenome/genetics', '*Histones/chemistry/metabolism', '*Host Microbial Interactions', 'Humans', '*Molecular Mimicry', '*SARS-CoV-2/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', '*Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Epigenomics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Histogram', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Microbial collection', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular mass', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
19767418,"The organization of mammalian DNA replication is poorly understood. We have produced genome-wide high-resolution dynamic maps of the timing of replication in human erythroid, mesenchymal and embryonic stem cells using TimEX, a method that relies on gaussian convolution of massive, highly redundant determinations of DNA copy number variations during S phase obtained using either high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays or massively-parallel sequencing to produce replication timing profiles. We show that in untransformed human cells, timing of replication is highly regulated and highly synchronous, and that many genomic segments are replicated in temporal transition regions devoid of initiation where replication forks progress unidirectionally from origins that can be hundreds of kilobases away. Absence of initiation in one transition region is shown at the molecular level by SMARD analysis. Comparison of ES and erythroid cells replication patterns revealed that these cells replicate about 20% of their genome in different quarter of S phase and that ES cells replicate a larger proportion of their genome in early S phase than erythroid cells. Importantly, we detected a strong inverse relationship between timing of replication and distance to the closest expressed gene. This relationship can be used to predict tissue specific timing of replication profiles from expression data and genomic annotations. We also provide evidence that early origins of replication are preferentially located near highly expressed genes, that mid firing origins are located near moderately expressed genes and that late firing origins are located far from genes.
Comparison of S/G1 from ES cells, MSCs and erythroid cellsThe purpose of the study was to measure replication timing by taking advantage of the fact that copy number of DNA increases from 2 two 4 during replication. Specifically, the study was designed to compare the number of copies of DNA of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with the number of copies of DNA of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. The cells in G1 and S of the cell cycle were obtained by sorting cells based on DNA content after staining with propidium iodide, a fluorescent compound that binds to DNA. We first tested the strategy with Nimblegen tiling arrays representing about 3% of the genome and found that it was indeed possible to measure such a small difference of copy number if a high-level of redundancy was used. We then extended the study genome-wide using massively parallel sequencing on either the SolID or the Illumina platform. Both platforms were tested and we found that for that application, both platforms were equivalent and provided sufficient number of reads to measure timing of replication genome-wide. We then attempted to better understand the correlation between timing of replication and transcription. We therefore obtained RNA from hESC and from erythroblast and hybridized them to standard Affymetrix U133plus2 arrays. This analysis revealed that it was possible to predict the replication timing patterns with relatively good accuracy (r=0.8) using expression data and distance of every genomic windows to express genes.","The organization of mammalian DNA replication is poorly understood.

In SP cells, which expel H33342, down-regulation of SOX17 was less pronounced than in NSP cells, which retain H33342. As a result of this, SOX17 displayed a 10-20-fold overexpression in cancer SP relative to NSP cells. Similar results were obtained for further stemness-related genes, namely EPC1 and SPRY1.

20348290,"Antimicrobial chemicals are widely applied to clean and disinfect food-contacting surfaces. However, the cellular response of bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, to various disinfectants is unclear. In this study, the physiological and genome-wide transcriptional responses of B. cereus ATCC 14579 exposed to four different disinfectants (i.e., benzalkonium chloride, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and peracetic acid) were analyzed. The physiological response of B. cereus to different concentrations of the disinfectants used was investigated. For each disinfectant, concentrations leading to the attenuation of growth, growth arrest, and cell death were studied in more detail. The simultaneous analysis of the transcriptional responses of B. cereus upon exposure to the different concentrations of disinfectants revealed common responses induced by the four disinfectants. Notably, genes involved in the general and oxidative stress responses were commonly up-regulated. Furthermore, the obtained results indicate that all the disinfectants also induce specific responses. Exposure to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant known to induce membrane damage, specifically induced genes involved in the fatty acid metabolism. Benzalkonium chloride induced-membrane damage was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and fatty acid analysis confirmed that fatty acid composition of cell membrane was affected upon exposure to benzalkonium chloride. Sodium hypochlorite induced genes involved in sulfur and sulfur-containing amino acids metabolism, which correlated with the observed sodium hypochlorite-specific induction of oxidation of sulphydryl groups. Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid exposures induced genes involved in DNA damage and the SOS response.

31481796,Profiling chromatin state by single-cell itChIP-seq [itChIP-seq],"Single-cell measurement of chromatin states, including histone modifications and non-histone protein binding, remains challenging. Here, we present a low-cost, efficient, simultaneous indexing and tagmentation-based ChIP-seq (itChIP-seq) method, compatible with both low cellular input and single cells for profiling chromatin states. itChIP combines chromatin opening, simultaneous cellular indexing and chromatin tagmentation within a single tube, enabling the processing of samples from tens of single cells to, more commonly, thousands of single cells per assay. We demonstrate that single-cell itChIP-seq (sc-itChIP-seq) yields ~9,000 unique reads per cell. Using sc-itChIP-seq to profile H3K27ac, we sufficiently capture the earliest epigenetic priming event during the cell fate transition from naive to primed pluripotency, and reveal the basis for cell-type specific enhancer usage during the differentiation of bipotent cardiac progenitor cells into endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Our results demonstrate that itChIP is a widely applicable technology for single-cell chromatin profiling of epigenetically heterogeneous cell populations in many biological processes.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Epigenomics/methods', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'cel', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Histogram', 'Mice or rats', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Protein modifications', 'Protein interaction data processing', 'Protein post-translational modifications', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
29543849,Gene expression profiles from mouse pancreatic islets at ZT8 or ZT20,"The rhythmic nature of insulin secretion over the 24h cycle in pancreatic islets has been mostly investigated using transcriptomics studies showing that modulation of insulin secretion over this cycle is achieved via distal stages of insulin secretion. We set out to measure β-cell exocytosis using in depth cell physiology techniques at several time points. In agreement with the activity and feeding pattern of nocturnal rodents, we find that C57/Bl6J islets in culture for 24h exhibit higher insulin secretion during the corresponding dark phase than in the light phase (Zeitgeber Time ZT20 and ZT8, respectively, in vivo). Glucose-induced insulin secretion is increased by 21% despite normal intracellular Ca2+ transients and depolarization-evoked exocytosis, as measured by whole-cell capacitance measurements. This paradox is explained by a 1.37-fold increase in beta cell insulin content. Ultramorphological analyses show that vesicle size and density are unaltered, demonstrating that intravesicular insulin content per granule is modulated over the 24h cycle. Proinsulin levels did not change between ZT8 and ZT20. Islet glucagon content was inversely proportional to insulin content indicating that this unique feature is likely to support a physiological role. Microarray data identified the differential expression of 301 transcripts, of which 26 are miRNAs and 54 are known genes (including C2cd4b, a gene previously involved in insulin processing, and clock genes such as Bmal1 and Rev-erbα). Mouse β-cell secretion over the full course of the 24h cycle may rely on several distinct cellular functions but late night increase in insulin secretion depends solely on granule insulin content.","['Animals', 'Exocytosis/physiology', 'Glucagon/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Proinsulin/metabolism', 'Secretory Vesicles/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exome sequencing', 'Exome assembly', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'Protein property']"

34888646,"Human DUX4 and mouse Dux transcription factors are normally expressed in the germ line and early embryonic cells where they activate the cleavage stage genes. The misexpression of DUX4 in skeletal muscles causes Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). In primates and rodents, DUX4 and Dux arose from retrotransposition of the mRNA from the ancestral intron-containing DUXC, which is not found in these species, and whether it has similar roles in the cleavage stage and FSHD as DUX4 and Dux are unknown. Here, we identified two isoforms of DUXC in canine testis tissues: One encodes the canonical double homeodomain (DUXC) similar to DUX4/Dux, and one contains an extra exon that disrupts the conserved amino-acid sequence of the first homeodomain (DUXC-ALT). We expressed DUXC and DUXC-ALT in canine skeletal muscle and found that the expression of DUXC induced retrotransposons and pluripotent programs similar to DUX4 and Dux, whereas DUXC-ALT did not robustly activate genes in these assays.
Determined the transcriptome of DUXC and DUXC-ALT by using a system that parallels tissue culture models of the human DUX4 transcriptome, forced expression of DUX4, DUXC, and DUXC-ALT transcription factors in cultrued canine skeletal muscle cells. We generate three doxycycline-inducible stable canine myoblast cell lines in which addition of doxycycline to the cell culture medium caused expression of three transcription factors and Luciferase (as a negative control).","Mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Human DUX4 and mouse Dux are retrogenes derived from retrotransposition of the mRNA from the parental DUXC gene. Primates and rodents have lost the parental DUXC gene, and it is unknown whether DUXC had a similar role in driving an early pluripotent transcriptional program. Dogs and other Laurasiatherians have retained DUXC, providing an opportunity to determine the functional similarity to the retrotransposed DUX4 and Dux. Here, we identify the expression of two isoforms of DUXC mRNA in canine testis tissues: one encoding the canonical double homeodomain protein (DUXC), similar to DUX4/Dux, and a second that includes an in-frame alternative exon that disrupts the conserved amino acid sequence of the first homeodomain (DUXC-ALT). The expression of DUXC in canine cells induces a pluripotent program similar to DUX4 and Dux and induces the expression of a similar set of retrotransposons of the ERV/MaLR and LINE-1 families, as well as pericentromeric satellite repeats; whereas DUXC-ALT did not robustly activate gene expression in these assays. Important for preclinical models of FSHD, human DUX4 and canine DUXC show higher conservation of their homeodomains and corresponding binding motifs compared with the conservation between human DUX4 and mouse Dux, and human DUX4 activates a highly similar transcriptional program in canine cells. Together, these findings show that retrotransposition resulted in the loss of an alternatively spliced isoform and that DUXC containing mammals might be good candidates for certain preclinical models ofFSHD.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mammals/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', '*Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroelements/genetics']","['Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'MAT', 'Mammals', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction']"

We found that during serial transplantation of SW480 cells into nude mice via subcutaneous injection (in vivo passaging), the cells enhanced their neural stemness, tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential.
SW480 cells (designated as S0) were injected subcutaneously into 6 nude mice at a does of 3x10^6 cells per mouse. 49 days later, tumors were dissected and tumor cells (designated as S1) were cultured in neural stem cell specific serum-free medium (Ndiff227 medium) for 9 days. Cell spheres formed in the serum-free medium were collected and dissociated by trituration. Each 3x10^6 of the cells of the tumors at the first transplantation were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, and tumors were dissected again after 49 days after transplantation. The tumors of the second transplantation (S2) were the cell source for the third transplantation (S3), which was done exactly as the first and second time. SW480 cells cultured in serum-free medium for 9 days (S0), sphere-forming cells from the first (S1), second (S2) and the third (S3) transplantation were subjected to RNA sequencing.","Neural stemness is suggested to be the ground state of tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential. However, the relationship between these cell properties is unclear. Here, by disrupting the neural regulatory network in neural stem and cancer cells and by serial transplantation of cancer cells, we show that tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential are coupled cell properties unified by neural stemness. We show that loss of neural stemness via inhibition of SETDB1, an oncoprotein with enriched expression in embryonic neural cells during vertebrate embryogenesis, led to neuronal differentiation with reduced tumorigenicity and pluripotent differentiation potential in neural stem and cancer cells, whereas enhancement of neural stemness by SETDB1 overexpression caused the opposite effects. SETDB1 maintains a regulatory network comprising proteins involved in developmental programs and basic cellular functional machineries, including epigenetic modifications (EZH2), ribosome biogenesis (RPS3), translation initiation (EIF4G), and spliceosome assembly (SF3B1); all of these proteins are enriched in embryonic neural cells and play active roles in cancers. In addition, SETDB1 represses the transcription of genes promoting differentiation and cell cycle and growth arrest. Serial transplantation of cancer cells showed that neural stemness, tumorigenicity, and pluripotent differentiation potential were simultaneously enhanced; these effects were accompanied by increased expression of proteins involved in developmental programs and basic machineries, including SETDB1 and the abovementioned proteins, as well as by increased alternative splicing events. These results indicate that basic machineries work together to define a highly proliferative state with pluripotent differentiation potential and also suggest that neural stemness unifies tumorigenicity and differentiation potential.","['*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Development', 'Flavonoids', '*Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', '*Neural Stem Cells/cytology', '*Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology']","['Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation analysis', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structural data', 'NeuroML']"

However, the molecular mechanisms of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression are not fully understood. Here we reported that hepatic Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a key integrative regulator of ectopic lipid accumulation and inflammation during NASH progression. Hepatic deletion of Wtap leads to NASH due to the increased lipolysis in white adipose tissue, enhanced hepatic free fatty acids uptake and induced inflammation, all of which are mediated by IGFBP1, CD36 and cytochemokines such as CCL2, respectively. WTAP binds to specific DNA motifs which are enriched in the promoters and suppresses gene expression (e.g., Igfbp1, Cd36 and Ccl2) with the involvement of HDAC1. In NASH, WTAP is tranlocated from nucleus to cytosol, which is related to CDK9-mediated phosphorylation.

35961752,"The eIF4G1 DAP5 homolog is involved in several non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms. We applied ribosome profiling and found that DAP5 translationally activated mRNAs are enriched with translated uORFs. We also performed a genome-wide UV-cross linking immunoprecipitation screen (CLIP-seq) for identifying mRNAs that directly interact with DAP5 in hESCs. We found 959 bound mRNAs common to both Abs (out of 1073 and 2152 enriched mRNAs identified by CS and MBL antibodies, respectively).
To asses DAP5 translation profile we performed ribosome profiling on DAP5-KD and NT control hESCs. The libraries were prepared from cells treated with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). In parallel, we used a tailored RNA-seq protocol to quantify RNA levels.For the CLIP-seq profiling H9 cells were UV cross-linked, lysed and treated with DNase.

The DAP5 bound mRNAs as well as the total RNA were used for libraries preparation.","Death associated protein 5 (DAP5/eIF4G2/NAT1) is a member of the eIF4G translation initiation factors that has been shown to mediate noncanonical and/or cap-independent translation. It is essential for embryonic development and for differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), specifically its ability to drive translation of specific target mRNAs. In order to expand the repertoire of DAP5 target mRNAs, we compared ribosome profiles in control and DAP5 knockdown (KD) human ESCs (hESCs) to identify mRNAs with decreased ribosomal occupancy upon DAP5 silencing. A cohort of 68 genes showed decreased translation efficiency in DAP5 KD cells. Mass spectrometry confirmed decreased protein abundance of a significant portion of these targets. Among these was KMT2D, a histone methylase previously shown to be essential for ESC differentiation and embryonic development. We found that nearly half of the cohort of DAP5 target mRNAs displaying reduced translation efficiency of their main coding sequences upon DAP5 KD contained upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that are actively translated independently of DAP5. This is consistent with previously suggested mechanisms by which DAP5 mediates leaky scanning through uORFs and/or reinitiation at the main coding sequence. Crosslinking protein-RNA immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that a significant subset of DAP5 mRNA targets bound DAP5, indicating that direct binding between DAP5 protein and its target mRNAs is a frequent but not absolute requirement for DAP5-dependent translation of the main coding sequence. Thus, we have extended DAP5's function in translation of specific mRNAs in hESCs by a mechanism allowing translation of the main coding sequence following upstream translation of short ORFs.","['Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/*metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', '*Human Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']","['Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Threading', 'Protein threading', 'Open science', 'protein', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein data', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
20616149,"Genomic radiation signature illuminates low-dose effects with sharply reflected transcriptome in Ptch1-deficient medulloblastomas.Cancer risks of low-dose radiation are of great concern especially in relation to rapidly increasing medical exposures; however, their accurate assessments cope with many challenges and difficulties, partly due to the inability to distinguish radiation-induced tumors from spontaneous ones.  Here, we analyzed the dose-dependent effect of radiation on medulloblastoma development in Ptch1 heterozygous mice on C3B6F1 background.  The incidence and latency of medulloblastoma increased and shortened with increasing radiation dose, respectively.  Amazingly, radiation contributed to tumorigenesis even at 50 mGy and 100% of mice got medulloblastoma with 1.5 Gy.  Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis on a total of 164 tumors indicated that spontaneous tumors showed LOH in broad regions on chromosome 13, including Ptch1 and distally-extending telomeric portion (S-type).  In contrast, tumors developed after 3 Gy irradiation exhibited interstitial losses around Ptch1 (R-type).  A clear dose-dependent increase in the proportion of R-type tumor at intermediate doses suggested R-type to be a reliable radiation signature.  Array-CGH analysis indicated the R-type-specific copy-number reduction around Ptch1 and LOH-type-independent frequent gains of whole chromosome 6. Integrated expression microarray analysis indicated that expression levels of many genes within the altered genomic regions faithfully reflected the genomic copy-number changes.  Furthermore, it was also suggested that these expression changes in turn influenced on many other genes, such as Tgfb2 and Tgfb3, on widespread genomic regions.  This is the first demonstration that radiation-induced tumors developed after low-dose irradiation can be characterized quite precisely by interstitial deletion of Ptch1 and by associated gene expression profile.
Gene expression in 3 normal cerebellum tissues and 12 medulloblastomas was measured.","Accurate cancer risk assessment of low-dose radiation poses many challenges that are partly due to the inability to distinguish radiation-induced tumors from spontaneous ones. To elucidate characteristic features of radiation-induced tumors, we analyzed 163 medulloblastomas that developed either spontaneously or after X-ray irradiation at doses of 0.05-3 Gy in Ptch1 heterozygous mice. All spontaneous tumors showed loss of heterozygosity in broad regions on chromosome 13, with losses at all consecutive markers distal to Ptch1 locus (S-type). In contrast, all tumors that developed after 3 Gy irradiation exhibited interstitial losses around Ptch1 with distal markers retained (R-type). There was a clear dose-dependent increase in the proportion of R-type tumors within the intermediate dose range, indicating that the R-type change is a reliable radiation signature. Importantly, the incidence of R-type tumors increased significantly (P = 0.007) at a dose as low as 50 mGy. Integrated array-comparative genomic hybridization and expression microarray analyses demonstrated that expression levels of many genes around the Ptch1 locus faithfully reflected the signature-associated reduction in genomic copy number.

Examination of transcriptomics and translatomics in mouse CD4+ T cells and derived TFH cells.","Little is known regarding T cell translational regulation. We demonstrate that T follicular helper (TFH) cells use a previously unknown mechanism of selective messenger RNA (mRNA) translation for their differentiation, role in B cell maturation, and in autoimmune pathogenesis. We show that TFH cells have much higher levels of translation factor eIF4E than non-TFH CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is essential for translation of TFH cell fate-specification mRNAs. Genome-wide translation studies indicate that modest down-regulation of eIF4E activity by a small-molecule inhibitor or short hairpin RN impairs TFH cell development and function. In mice, down-regulation of eIF4E activity specifically reduces TFH cells among T helper subtypes, germinal centers, B cell recruitment, and antibody production. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, eIF4E activity down-regulation blocks TFH cell participation in disease pathogenesis while promoting rapid remission and spinal cord remyelination. TFH cell development and its role in autoimmune pathogenesis involve selective mRNA translation that is highly druggable.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Germinal Center/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', '*T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Eukaryotes', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Structure determination', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice']"

35484100,"Molecular analysis of CD123 loss following UCART123 treatment.
The RNA were extracted from CD123- cells or CD123+ cells from UCART123 treated mice in PDX-3 experiment. In the PDX study, mice treated with UCART123 experienced CD123-negative relapse. Unexpectedly, we identified not a single, but three diverse mechanisms of CD123 loss amongst mice that relapsed with CD123- disease: genomic loss of CD123 DNA; a truncated transcript containing only exons 2-9; and predominant alternative splicing (skipping from exon 2 to exon 5) which is reminiscent of CD19 epitope loss in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia36. The most plausible explanation is the selection of a small pre-existing population of clones lacking CD123, that were enriched upon the selective pressure of UCART123 therapy.","Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic malignancy with poor outcomes with conventional therapy. Nearly 100% of BPDCNs overexpress interleukin 3 receptor subunit alpha (CD123). Given that CD123 is differentially expressed on the surface of BPDCN cells, it has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. UCART123 is an investigational product consisting of allogeneic T cells expressing an anti-CD123 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), edited with TALEN<sup>®</sup> nucleases. In this study, we examine the antitumor activity of UCART123 in preclinical models of BPDCN. We report that UCART123 have selective antitumor activity against CD123-positive primary BPDCN samples (while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells) in the in vitro cytotoxicity and T cell degranulation assays; supported by the increased secretion of IFNγ by UCART123 cells when cultured in the presence of BPDCN cells. UCART123 eradicate BPDCN and result in long-term disease-free survival in a subset of primary patient-derived BPDCN xenograft mouse models. One potential challenge of CD123 targeting therapies is the loss of CD123 antigen through diverse genetic mechanisms, an event observed in one of three BPDCN PDX studied.

35859152,"We conducted quantitative ChIP-seq following inhibition of EZH2 to better understand the influence of H3K27me3 on facultative and consitutive heterochromatin.
Quantitative ChIP-seq was performed in duplicate for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 following 72 hours of EZH2 inhibitor or vehicle treatment with doxycycline added for the final 24 hours of the drug treatment.","The genome can be divided into two spatially segregated compartments, A and B, which partition active and inactive chromatin states. While constitutive heterochromatin is predominantly located within the B compartment near the nuclear lamina, facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 spans both compartments. How epigenetic modifications, compartmentalization, and lamina association collectively maintain heterochromatin architecture remains unclear. Here we develop Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C (LIMe-Hi-C) to jointly measure chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and lamina positioning. Through LIMe-Hi-C, we identify topologically distinct sub-compartments with high levels of H3K27me3 and differing degrees of lamina association. Inhibition of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) reveals that H3K27me3 is essential for sub-compartment segregation. Unexpectedly, PRC2 inhibition promotes lamina association and constitutive heterochromatin spreading into H3K27me3-marked B sub-compartment regions. Consistent with this repositioning, genes originally marked with H3K27me3 in the B compartment, but not the A compartment, remain largely repressed, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin spreading can compensate for H3K27me3 loss at a transcriptional level. These findings demonstrate that Polycomb sub-compartments and their antagonism with lamina association are fundamental features of genome structure. More broadly, by jointly measuring nuclear position and Hi-C contacts, our study demonstrates how compartmentalization and lamina association represent distinct but interdependent modes of heterochromatin regulation.","['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', '*Histones/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism']","['Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Histogram', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"

Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to investigate the temporal order of gene expression in cells of the melanocyte lineage which were included among GFP-expressing cells isolated from Tg(mitfa-GFP) zebrafish embryos at 28 hours post fertilization (hpf)","In developing melanocytes and in melanoma cells, multiple paralogs of the Activating-enhancer-binding Protein 2 family of transcription factors (TFAP2) contribute to expression of genes encoding pigmentation regulators, but their interaction with Microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), a master regulator of these cells, is unclear. Supporting the model that TFAP2 facilitates MITF's ability to activate expression of pigmentation genes, single-cell seq analysis of zebrafish embryos revealed that pigmentation genes are only expressed in the subset of mitfa-expressing cells that also express tfap2 paralogs. To test this model in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells we deleted the two TFAP2 paralogs with highest expression, TFAP2A and TFAP2C, creating TFAP2 knockout (TFAP2-KO) cells. We then assessed gene expression, chromatin accessibility, binding of TFAP2A and of MITF, and the chromatin marks H3K27Ac and H3K27Me3 which are characteristic of active enhancers and silenced chromatin, respectively. Integrated analyses of these datasets indicate TFAP2 paralogs directly activate enhancers near genes enriched for roles in pigmentation and proliferation, and directly repress enhancers near genes enriched for roles in cell adhesion. Consistently, compared to WT cells, TFAP2-KO cells proliferate less and adhere to one another more. TFAP2 paralogs and MITF co-operatively activate a subset of enhancers, with the former necessary for MITF binding and chromatin accessibility. By contrast, TFAP2 paralogs and MITF do not appear to co-operatively inhibit enhancers. These studies reveal a mechanism by which TFAP2 profoundly influences the set of genes activated by MITF, and thereby the phenotype of pigment cells and melanoma cells.","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', '*Melanoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Microphthalmos/genetics', 'Pigmentation/genetics', 'Zebrafish/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Generation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'chrominfo', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'ELAND format', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Ophthalmology', 'Annotation', 'Fish']"

30258080,Long noncoding RNA NKX2-1-AS1 inhibits cell migration and regulates cell-adhesion independent of NKX2-1 in human lung carcinoma cells,"The function of most long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is unknown. However, recent studies reveal important roles of lncRNAs in regulating cancer-related pathways. Human antisense lncRNA-NKX2-1-AS1 partially overlaps the NKX2-1/TTF1 gene within chromosomal region 14q13.3. Amplification of this region and/or differential expression of genes therein are associated with cancer progression. Herein we show higher levels of NKX2-AS1 and NKX2-1 in lung adenocarcinomas relative to non-tumor controls but no correlation between NKX2-1-AS1 and NKX2-1 levels across specimens, or with amplification of the 14q13.3 region, suggesting that NKX2-1-AS1 and NKX2-1 are independently regulated. Loss-and-gain of function experiments showed that NKX2-1-AS1 does not regulate NKX2-1 expression, or nearby genes, but controls genes in trans. Genes up-regulated by NKX2-1-AS1-knockdown belong to cell adhesion and PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint pathways. NKX2-1-AS1 negatively regulates endogenous CD274/PD-L1, a known target of NKX2-1, and the transcriptional activity of -1kb-CD274 promoter-reporter construct. Furthermore, NKX2-1-AS1 interferes with NKX2-1 protein binding to the CD274-promoter, likely by NKX2-1 protein-NKX2-1-AS1 interactions. Finally, NKX2-1-AS1 negatively regulates cell migration and wound healing, but not proliferation or apoptosis. These findings support potential roles of NKX2-1-AS1 in limiting motility and immune system evasion of lung carcinoma cells, highlighting a novel mechanism that may influence tumorigenic capabilities of lung epithelial cells.","['B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism']","['Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'GEN', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA', 'rna', 'DNA sense specification', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'Coding region', 'Plasmid map', 'Transcription factor name']"

Thus, sumoylation-modulating chemicals might be used to control MSC differentiation for skeletal tissue engineering. In this work, we studied how the differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cells (mBMSCs) is affected by ginkgolic acid (GA), a potent sumoylation inhibitor also reported to inhibit histone acetylation transferase (HAT). Our results show that GA promoted the differentiation of mBMSCs into adipocytes when cultured in osteogenic medium. Moreover, mBMSCs pre-treated with GA showed enhanced pre-adipogenic gene expression and were more efficiently differentiated into adipocytes when subsequently cultured in the adipogenic medium. However, when GA was added at a later stage of adipogenesis, adipocyte maturation was markedly inhibited, with a dramatic down-regulation of multiple lipogenesis genes. Moreover, we found that the effects of garcinol, a HAT inhibitor, differed from those of GA in regulating adipocyte commitment and adipocyte maturation of mBMSCs, implying that the GA function in adipogenesis is likely through its activity as a sumoylation inhibitor, not as a HAT inhibitor. Overall, our studies revealed an unprecedented role of GA in MSC differentiation and provide new mechanistic insights into the use of GA in clinical applications.","['Adipogenesis/*drug effects', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Salicylates/*pharmacology', 'Sumoylation/*drug effects', 'Terpenes/pharmacology']","['Phylogenetic analysis', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'DNA methylation', 'Relation extraction', 'Keyword']"

Molecular subtypes may be relevant to prognosis and therapeutic possibilities, but have to date not been defined in Lynch syndrome-associated urothelial cancer. We aimed to provide a molecular description of Lynch syndrome-associated UC. Thus, Lynch syndrome-associated UCs of the upper urinary tract and the urinary bladder were identified in the Danish hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) register and were transcriptionally and immunohistochemically profiled and further related to data from 307 sporadic urothelial carcinomas. Whole-genome mRNA expression profiles of 41 tumors and immunohistochemical stainings against FGFR3, KRT5, CCNB1, RB1, and CDKN2A (p16) of 37 tumors from patients with Lynch syndrome were generated. Pathological data, microsatellite instability, anatomic location, and overall survival data were analyzed and compared with sporadic bladder cancer. The 41 Lynch syndrome-associated UC developed at a mean age of 61 years with 59% women. mRNA expression profiling and immunostaining classified the majority of the Lynch syndrome-associated UC as urothelial-like tumors with only 20% being genomically unstable, basal/SCC-like, or other subtypes. The subtypes were associated with stage, grade, and microsatellite instability.

30472020,KDM5B links cellular transcriptome heterogeneity to therapy resistance (Exome-Seq),"Members of the KDM5 histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase family are associated with therapeutic resistance, including endocrine resistance in breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Here we show that genetic deletion of KDM5A/B or inhibition of KDM5 activity increases sensitivity to anti-estrogens by modulating estrogen receptor (ER) signaling and by decreasing cellular transcriptomic heterogeneity. Higher KDM5B expression levels are associated with higher transcriptomic heterogeneity and poor prognosis in ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing, cellular barcoding, and mathematical modeling demonstrate that endocrine resistance is due to selection for pre-existing genetically distinct cells, while KDM5 inhibitor resistance is acquired. Our findings highlight the importance of cellular phenotypic heterogeneity in therapeutic resistance and identify KDM5A/B as key regulators of this process.","['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor Modulators/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant/pharmacology', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/drug effects/*genetics', 'Exome Sequencing/methods']","['BEAST', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Exome sequencing', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'CATH domain ID', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein expression', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
31089135,The Role of Lkb1 in Mouse Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Development,"Mechanisms of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) development are poorly understood. Here, we report that JNK1/2 activities attenuate Lkb1-deficiency-driven LSCC initiation and progression through repressing ΔNp63 signaling. In vivo Lkb1 ablation alone is sufficient to induce LSCC development by reducing MKK7 levels and JNK1/2 activities, independent of the AMPKα and mTOR pathways. JNK1/2 activities is positively regulated by MKK7 during LSCC development. Pharmaceutically elevated JNK1/2 activities abates Lkb1 dependent LSCC formation while compound mutations of Jnk1/2 and Lkb1 further accelerate LSCC progression. JNK1/2 is inactivated in a substantial proportion of human LSCC and JNK1/2 activities positively correlates with survival rates of lung, cervical and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. These findings not only determine a suppressive role of the stress response regulators JNK1/2 on LSCC development by acting downstream of the key LSCC suppresser Lkb1, but also demonstrate activating JNK1/2 activities as a therapeutic approach against LSCC.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 7/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']","['Kinase name', 'Protein databases', 'protein', 'Protein active sites', 'MGED', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAP', 'Map', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Protein threading', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Tumor annotation', 'Proteins', 'Protein expression']"
29872087,Prior activity of olfactory receptor neurons is required for proper sensory processing and behavior in Drosophila larvae,"Animal responses to their environment rely on activation of sensory neurons by external stimuli. In many sensory systems, however, neurons display basal activity prior to the external stimuli. This prior activity is thought to modulate neural functions, yet its impact on animal behavior remains elusive. Here, we reveal a potential role for prior activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in shaping larval olfactory behavior. We show that prior activity in larval ORNs is mediated by the olfactory receptor complex (OR complex). Mutations of Orco, an odorant co-receptor required for OR complex function, cause reduced attractive behavior in response to optogenetic activation of ORNs. Calcium imaging reveals that Orco mutant ORNs fully respond to optogenetic stimulation but exhibit altered temporal patterns of neural responses. These findings together suggest a critical role for prior activity in information processing upon ORN activation in Drosophila larvae, which in turn contributes to olfactory behavior control.","['Animals', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Larva/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Odorants', 'Olfactory Pathways/metabolism/*physiology', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons/metabolism/*physiology', 'Optogenetics/methods', 'Receptors, Odorant/genetics/*physiology', 'Sensory Receptor Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Smell/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Scents', 'Pathway or network', 'Pathway ID (WikiPathways)', 'Signaling pathways', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Phylogenetics', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'cel']"

29768163,Tissue damage signaling is essential for protective neutrophil recruitment to microbial infection in zebrafish (Danio rerio),"Tissue damage and infection are deemed likewise triggers of innate immune responses. But whereas neutrophil responses to microbes are generally protective, neutrophil recruitment into damaged tissues without infection is deleterious. Why neutrophils respond to tissue damage and not just to microbes is unknown. Is it a flaw of the innate immune system that persists because evolution did not select against it, or does it provide a selective advantage? Here we dissect the contribution of tissue damage signaling to antimicrobial immune responses in a live vertebrate. By intravital imaging of zebrafish larvae, a powerful model for innate immunity, we show that prevention of tissue damage signaling upon microbial ear infection abrogates leukocyte chemotaxis and reduces animal survival, at least in part, through suppression of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPla<sub>2</sub>), which integrates tissue damage- and microbe-derived cues. Thus, microbial cues are insufficient, and damage signaling is essential for antimicrobial neutrophil responses in zebrafish.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Fish Diseases/*immunology/microbiology', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Larva/immunology/microbiology', 'Neutrophil Infiltration/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Zebrafish/genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/immunology/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Information extraction', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Fish', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
30085281,Shared Nucleotide Flanks Confer Transcriptional Competency to bZip Core Motifs,"Sequence-specific DNA binding recruits transcription factors (TFs) to the genome to regulate gene expression. Here, we perform high resolution mapping of CEBP proteins to determine how sequence dictates genomic occupancy. We demonstrate a fundamental difference between the sequence repertoire utilized by CEBPs in vivo versus the palindromic sequence preference reported by classical in vitro models, by identifying a palindromic motif at <1% of the genomic binding sites. On the native genome, CEBPs bind a diversity of related 10 bp sequences resulting from the fusion of degenerate and canonical half-sites. Altered DNA specificity of CEBPs in cells occurs through heterodimerization with other bZip TFs, and approximately 40% of CEBP-binding sites in primary human cells harbor motifs characteristic of CEBP heterodimers. In addition, we uncover an important role for sequence bias at core-motif-flanking bases for CEBPs and demonstrate that flanking bases regulate motif function across mammalian bZip TFs. Favorable flanking bases confer efficient TF occupancy and transcriptional activity, and DNA shape may explain how the flanks alter TF binding. Importantly, motif optimization within the 10-mer is strongly correlated with cell-type-independent recruitment of CEBPβ, providing key insight into how sequence sub-optimization affects genomic occupancy of widely expressed CEBPs across cell types.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Dimerization', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Nucleotide Motifs', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Binding', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Forcefield parameterisation', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide identifier', 'Nucleotide code', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'protein', 'Model organisms', 'Species name', 'Pathogens', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Structure', 'Relation extraction', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Chemical formula', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
26280535,Analysis of the senescent transcriptome upon expression of a ZFP36L1 phosphomutant,"Senescent cells secrete a combination of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Sequence', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Mice or rats', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Proteins', 'Lipoproteins', 'protein', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Kinase name']"
31983537,Astrocytic trans-differentiation completes a multicellular paracrine feedback loop required for medulloblastoma tumor growth,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor progression. However, the establishment and function of the TME remain obscure because of its complex cellular composition. Using a mouse genetic system called mosaic analysis with double markers (MADMs), we delineated TME evolution at single-cell resolution in sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated medulloblastomas that originate from unipotent granule neuron progenitors in the brain. First, we found that astrocytes within the TME (TuAstrocytes) were trans-differentiated from tumor granule neuron precursors (GNPs), which normally never differentiate into astrocytes. Second, we identified that TME-derived IGF1 promotes tumor progression. Third, we uncovered that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is produced by tumor-associated microglia in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. Finally, we found that IL-4 is secreted by TuAstrocytes. Collectively, our studies reveal an evolutionary process that produces a multi-lateral network within the TME of medulloblastoma: a fraction of tumor cells trans-differentiate into TuAstrocytes, which, in turn, produce IL-4 that stimulates microglia to produce IGF1 to promote tumor progression.","['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Transdifferentiation', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/metabolism', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Tumor Microenvironment']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Heterogen annotation', 'R script', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Tumor annotation']"
31603276,Transcriptome analysis of enriched pea powdery mildew Erysiphe pisi haustoria,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Peas/*genetics', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Leaves/microbiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']","['Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Mascot .dat file', 'Simulation', 'Simulation analysis', 'Computer science', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Peptide mass fingerprint', 'Pearson format', 'Peak calling', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA structure', 'Protein structure', 'Protein structure analysis', 'Structural biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high- to low-affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA:target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. Using single-cell reporters, we directly test predictions and estimate that ?3,000 additional high-affinity target sites can affect active miRNA families with low endogenous miRNA:target ratios, such as miR-92/25. In contrast, the highly expressed miR-294 and let-7 families are not susceptible to increases of nearly 10,000 sites.

25414836,Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS5005: control vs heme exposure,"The massive erythrocyte lysis caused by the Group A Streptococcus (GAS) suggests that the β-hemolytic pathogen is likely to encounter free heme during the course of infection. In this study, we investigated GAS mechanisms for heme sensing and tolerance. We compared the minimal inhibitory concentration of heme among several isolates and established that excess heme is bacteriostatic and exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of heme resulted in noticeable damage to membrane lipids and proteins. Pre-exposure of the bacteria to 0.1 μM heme shortened the extended lag period that is otherwise observed when naive cells are inoculated into heme-containing medium, implying that GAS is able to adapt. The global response to heme exposure was determined using microarray analysis revealing a significant transcriptome shift that included 79 up regulated and 84 down regulated genes. Among other changes, the induction of stress-related chaperones and proteases, including groEL/ES (8x), the stress regulators spxA2 (5x) and ctsR (3x), as well as redox active enzymes were prominent. The heme stimulon also encompassed a number of regulatory proteins and two-component systems that are important for virulence. A three-gene cluster that is homologous to the pefRCD system of the Group B Streptococcus was also induced by heme. PefR, a MarR-like regulator, specifically binds heme with stoichiometry of 1:2 and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) with stoichiometry of 1:1, implicating it is one of the GAS mediators to heme response. In summary, here we provide evidence that heme induces a broad stress response in GAS, and that its success as a pathogen relies on mechanisms for heme sensing, detoxification, and repair.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Genetic Loci', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Hemolysin Proteins/metabolism', 'Hemolysis', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Streptococcal Infections/*metabolism/*microbiology', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/drug effects/growth & development/*physiology', 'Stress, Physiological']","['Codon adaptation index', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Toxin name', 'Toxin structure', 'Toxin accession', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'COGEME EST ID', 'Protein analysis', 'Analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Lipid accession', 'Lipid report', 'Lipid structure', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein topological domains', 'Protein topology', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Mathematical model']"

It is characterized by a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple fatty liver (NAFL) to steatohepatitis (NASH), with a possible progression to fibrosis, thus increasing liver-related morbidity and mortality. NAFLD development is driven by the co-action of several risk factors, including obesity and metabolic syndrome, which may be both genetically induced and diet-related. Recently, particular attention has been paid to the gut-liver axis, which may play a physio-pathological role in the onset and progression of the disease. The gut microbiota is intended to act as a bioreactor that can guarantee autonomous metabolic and immunological functions and that can drive functional strategies within the environment of the body in response to external stimuli. The complexity of the gut microbiota suggests that it behaves as an organ. Therefore, the concept of the gut-liver axis must be complemented with the gut-microbiota-liver network due to the high intricacy of the microbiota components and metabolic activities; these activities form the active diet-driven power plant of the host.

By utilizing the buoyant density of DNA-protein complexes after cross-linking, we here develop a mass spectrometry-based approach to quantify the chromatin-associated proteome at separate stages of the cell cycle. While epigenetic modifiers that promote transcription are lost from mitotic chromatin, repressive modifiers generally remain associated. Furthermore, while proteins involved in transcriptional elongation are evicted, most identified transcription factors are retained on mitotic chromatin to varying degrees, including core promoter binding proteins. This predicts conservation of the regulatory landscape on mitotic chromosomes, which we confirm by genome-wide measurements of chromatin accessibility. In summary, this work establishes an approach to study chromatin, provides a comprehensive catalog of chromatin changes during the cell cycle, and reveals the degree to which the genomic regulatory landscape is maintained through mitosis.","['*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
29321003,A prototypical non-malignant epithelial model to study genome dynamics and concurrently monitor micro-RNAs and proteins in situ during oncogene-induced senescence (miRNA-seq),"Senescence is a fundamental biological process implicated in various pathologies, including cancer. Regarding carcinogenesis, senescence signifies, at least in its initial phases, an anti-tumor response that needs to be circumvented for cancer to progress. Micro-RNAs, a subclass of regulatory, non-coding RNAs, participate in senescence regulation.

Few of these traits have evolved repeatedly in vertebrates, preventing the analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying these traits comparatively. Electric organs have evolved multiple times among vertebrates, presenting a unique opportunity to understand the degree of constraint and repeatability of the evolutionary processes underlying novel vertebrate traits. As there is now a completed genome sequence representing South American electric eels, we were motivated to obtain genomic sequence from a linage that independently evolved electric organs to facilitate future comparative analyses of the evolution and development of electric organs. We report here the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome of the mormyrid Paramormyrops kingsleyae using short-read sequencing. In addition, we have completed a somatic transcriptome from 11 tissues to construct a gene expression atlas of predicted genes from this assembly, enabling us to identify candidate housekeeping genes as well as genes differentially expressed in the major somatic tissues of the mormyrid electric fish. We anticipate that this resource will greatly facilitate comparative studies on the evolution and development of electric organs and electroreceptors.","['Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Electric Fish/*genetics', 'Fish Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Fish', 'Protein isoelectric point', 'Electron density map', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Here, we uncover a ribosome-based mechanism/checkpoint involved in control of the innate immune response and microglial activation. Using an in vivo model system for analysis of the dynamic translational state of microglial ribosomes, with mRNAs as input and newly synthesized peptides as an output, we find a marked dissociation of microglia mRNA and protein networks following innate immune challenge. Highly upregulated and ribosome-associated mRNAs were not translated, resulting in two distinct microglial molecular signatures, a highly specialized pro-inflammatory mRNA signature and an immunomodulatory/homeostatic protein signature. We find that this is due to specific translational suppression of highly expressed mRNAs through a 3' UTR-mediated mechanism involving the RNA-binding protein SRSF3.

29271044,Disruption of circadian clockwork in in vivo reprogramming-induced mouse kidney tumors,"The circadian clock, which regulates cellular physiology, such as energy metabolism, resides in each cell level throughout the body. Recently, it has been elucidated that the cellular circadian clock is closely linked with cellular differentiation. Moreover, the misregulation of cellular differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) induced abnormally differentiated cells with impaired circadian clock oscillation, concomitant with the post-transcriptional suppression of CLOCK proteins. Here, we show that the circadian molecular oscillation is disrupted in dysdifferentiation-mediated mouse kidney tumors induced by partial in vivo reprogramming, resembling Wilms tumors. The expression of CLOCK protein was dramatically reduced in the tumor cells despite the Clock mRNA expression. We also showed that a similar loss of CLOCK was observed in human Wilms tumors, suggesting that the circadian molecular clockwork may be disrupted in dysdifferentiation-mediated embryonal tumors such as Wilms tumors, similar to the in vivo reprogramming-induced mouse kidney tumors.

30177956,A transcriptomic and functional analysis of the interaction between Caenorhabditis elegans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,"The bacterivorous nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is an excellent model for the study of innate immune responses to a variety of bacterial pathogens, including the emerging nosocomial bacterial pathogen <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</i>. The study of this interaction has ecological and medical relevance as <i>S. maltophilia</i> is found in association with <i>C. elegans</i> and other nematodes in the wild and is an emerging opportunistic bacterial pathogen. We identified 393 genes that were differentially expressed when exposed to virulent and avirulent strains of <i>S. maltophilia</i> and an avirulent strain of <i>E. coli</i>. We then used a probabilistic functional gene network model (WormNet) to determine that 118 of the 393 differentially expressed genes formed an interacting network and identified a set of highly connected genes with eight or more predicted interactions. We hypothesized that these highly connected genes might play an important role in the defense against <i>S. maltophila</i> and found that mutations of six of seven highly connected genes have a significant effect on nematode survival in response to these bacteria. Of these genes, C48B4.1, <i>mpk-2, cpr-4, clec-67</i>, and <i>lys-6</i> are needed for combating the virulent <i>S. maltophilia</i> JCMS strain, while <i>dod-22</i> was solely involved in response to the avirulent <i>S. maltophilia</i> K279a strain.

We analyze 1,844 localized (1,289) or mCRPC (555) tumors and quantify the prevalence of 113 somatic driver single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number aberrations (CNAs), and structural variants (SVs) in each state. One-third are significantly more prevalent in mCRPC than expected while a quarter are less prevalent. Mutations in AR and its enhancer are more prevalent in mCRPC, as are those in TP53, MYC, ZNRF3 and PRKDC. ZNRF3 loss is associated with decreased ZNRF3 mRNA abundance, WNT, cell cycle & PRC1/2 activity, and genomic instability. ZNRF3 loss, RNA downregulation and hypermethylation are prognostic of metastasis and overall survival, independent of clinical and pathologic indices. These data demonstrate a strategy for identifying biomarkers of localized cancer aggression, with ZNRF3 loss as a predictor of metastasis in prostate cancer.","['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']","['Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Local alignment', 'Mutation annotation (prevalence)', 'Sequence retrieval', 'Virulence prediction', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein databases', 'Protein sequences']"

We combined the genome sequence information from 50 Polyporales species, including 26 newly sequenced genomes and sought for genomic and functional adaptations to wood decay through the analysis of genome composition and transcriptome responses to different carbon sources. The genomes of Polyporales from different phylogenetic clades showed poor conservation in macrosynteny, indicative of genome rearrangements. We observed different gene family expansion/contraction histories for plant cell wall degrading enzymes in core polyporoids and phlebioids and captured expansions for genes involved in signalling and regulation in the lineages of white rotters. Furthermore, we identified conserved cupredoxins, thaumatin-like proteins and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases with a yet uncharacterized appended module as new candidate players in wood decomposition.

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The effect of posttranslational modifications has not been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging because individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S, and polysomes). Here we develop polysome proteome profiling to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. Our method combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on the fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12/uL11, a known mitotic CDK1 substrate, is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12/uL11 phosphorylation regulates the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis.

We identified changes in gene expression following IAV infection of A549 cells. Changes included an increase in transcripts encoding proteins with fibronectin-type III (FnIII) domains, such as fibronectin (Fn), tenascin N (TNN), and tenascin C (TNC). We tested the idea that increased expression of TNC may affect the outcome of an IAV-GAS superinfection. To do so, we created a GAS strain that lacked the Fn-binding protein PrtF.2. We found that the wild-type GAS strain, but not the mutant, co-localized with TNC and bound to purified TNC. In addition, adherence of the wild-type strain to IAV-infected A549 cells was greater compared to the prtF.2 mutant. The wild-type strain was also more abundant in the lungs of mice 24 hours after superinfection compared to the mutant strain. Finally, all mice infected with IAV and the prtF.2 mutant strain survived superinfection compared to only 42% infected with IAV and the parental GAS strain, indicating that PrtF.2 contributes to virulence in a murine model of IAV-GAS superinfection.","['A549 Cells', 'Adhesins, Bacterial/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/pathogenicity', 'Influenza, Human/microbiology/*pathology', 'Lung/microbiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Streptococcal Infections/microbiology/*pathology', 'Streptococcus pyogenes/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Superinfection/microbiology/*pathology', 'Tenascin/*metabolism', 'Virulence']","['cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Adhesin prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Infectious disease', 'Selection detection', 'Phylogenetic sub/super tree construction', 'Protein super-secondary structure prediction', 'Virulence prediction', 'Sequence']"
32367046,In vitro capture and characterization of embryonic rosette-stage pluripotency between naive and primed states,"Following implantation, the naive pluripotent epiblast of the mouse blastocyst generates a rosette, undergoes lumenogenesis and forms the primed pluripotent egg cylinder, which is able to generate the embryonic tissues. How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency. The rosette is therefore a reversible pluripotent intermediate whereby control over both pluripotency progression and morphogenesis pivots from WNT to MEK signals.","['Animals', 'Blastocyst/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Germ Layers/metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Morphogenesis/physiology', 'Otx Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST results', 'BLAST sequence alignment type', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Keyword', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Our laboratory has been interested in the physical interactions, in nuclei of human pancreatic β cells, between the insulin (<i>INS)</i> gene and other genes that are involved in insulin metabolism. We have identified, using Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C), many physical contacts in a human pancreatic β cell line between the <i>INS</i> promoter on chromosome 11 and sites on most other chromosomes. Many of these contacts are associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci. To determine whether physical contact is correlated with an ability of the <i>INS</i> locus to affect expression of these genes, we knock down <i>INS</i> expression by targeting the promoter; 259 genes are either up or down-regulated. Of these, 46 make physical contact with <i>INS</i> We analyze a subset of the contacted genes and show that all are associated with acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27, a marker of actively expressed genes. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in revealing regulatory pathways, we identify from among the contacted sites the previously uncharacterized gene <i>SSTR5-AS1</i> and show that it plays an important role in controlling the effect of somatostatin-28 on insulin secretion.

Analysis from TCGA raised the possibility that hyperactive PPAR signaling, either due to PPAR gamma gene amplification or RXRA hot-spot mutation (S427F/Y) drives 20-25% of human bladder cancers. Here, we characterize mutant RXRA, demonstrating it induces enhancer/promoter activity in the context of RXRA/PPAR heterodimers in human bladder cancer cells. Structure-function studies indicate that the RXRA substitution allosterically regulates the PPAR AF2 domain via an aromatic interaction with the terminal tyrosine found in PPARs. In mouse urothelial organoids, PPAR agonism is sufficient to drive growth-factor-independent growth in the context of concurrent tumor suppressor loss. Similarly, mutant RXRA stimulates growth-factor-independent growth of <i>Trp53/Kdm6a</i> null bladder organoids.

Through micrococcal nuclease mapping, we show that fission yeast chromosome ends are assembled into distinct protected structures ('telosomes') encompassing the telomeric DNA repeats and over half a kilobase of subtelomeric DNA. Telosome formation depends on the conserved telomeric proteins Taz1 and Rap1, and surprisingly, RNA. Although yeast telomeres have long been thought to be free of histones, we show that this is not the case; telomere repeats contain histones. While telomeric histone H3 bears the heterochromatic lys9-methyl mark, we show that this mark is dispensable for telosome formation. Therefore, telomeric chromatin is organized at an architectural level, in which telomere-binding proteins and RNAs impose a unique nucleosome arrangement, and a second level, in which histone modifications are superimposed upon the higher order architecture.","['Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Heterochromatin/ultrastructure', 'Histone Code', 'Histones/physiology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/physiology', 'Nucleosomes/ultrastructure', 'RNA, Fungal/*physiology', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/*physiology', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*physiology']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Gene ID', 'CATH node ID', 'Genetic code', 'Histogram', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'protein', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"

Here we show that cohesin is required for the core transcriptional response of primary macrophages to microbial signals, and for inducible enhancer activity that underpins inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with a role for inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Critical care medicine', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein domains', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipoproteins']"

However, the conservation and divergence of 6mA distribution patterns and functions in plants remain elusive. Here we report high-quality 6mA methylomes at single-nucleotide resolution in rice based on substantially improved genome sequences of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare (Nip; Japonica) and 93-11 (Indica). Analysis of 6mA genomic distribution and its association with transcription suggest that 6mA distribution and function is rather conserved between rice and Arabidopsis. We found that 6mA levels are positively correlated with the expression of key stress-related genes, which may be responsible for the difference in stress tolerance between Nip and 93-11. Moreover, we showed that mutations in DDM1 cause defects in plant growth and decreased 6mA level. Our results reveal that 6mA is a conserved DNA modification that is positively associated with gene expression and contributes to key agronomic traits in plants.","['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genome, Plant/*genetics', 'Heat-Shock Response/genetics', 'Oryza/*genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics']","['DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Genome map', 'Plant biology', 'Genome alignment', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'Physiology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model accession']"

Proinflammatory and immunomodulatory events that drive development of K-ras mutant LUAD are poorly understood. Here, we develop a lung epithelial specific K-ras mutant/Stat3 conditional knockout (LR/Stat3<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>) mouse model. Epithelial Stat3 deletion results in intriguing sex-associated discrepancies; K-ras mutant tumors are decreased in female LR/Stat3<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice whereas tumor burdens are increased in males. RNA-sequencing and tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis demonstrate increased anti-tumor immune responses following Stat3 deletion in females and, conversely, elevated pro-tumor immune pathways in males. While IL-6 blockade in male LR/Stat3<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice reduces lung tumorigenesis, inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling in female mice augments K-ras mutant oncogenesis and reprograms lung TME toward a pro-tumor phenotype.

Mouse crypts develop postnatally and are the architectural unit of the stem cell niche, yet the pathways that drive their formation are not known. Here, we combine transcriptomic, quantitative morphometric, and genetic analyses to identify mechanisms of crypt development. We uncover the upregulation of a contractility gene network at the earliest stage of crypt formation, which drives myosin II-dependent apical constriction and invagination of the crypt progenitor cells. Subsequently, hinges form, compartmentalizing crypts from villi. Hinges contain basally constricted cells, and this cell shape change was inhibited by increased hemidesmosomal adhesion in Rac1 null mice. Loss of hinges resulted in reduced villar spacing, revealing an unexpected role for crypts in tissue architecture and physiology. These studies provide a framework for studying crypt morphogenesis and identify essential regulators of niche formation.","['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation/*physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Integrins/genetics/metabolism', 'Intestines/*cytology/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Morphogenesis/*physiology', 'Myosin Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Transcriptome', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'GO concept ID (cellular component)', 'Comparison', 'Article comparison', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Multiomics', 'Integrated gene prediction', 'Ion counting', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction']"
30089854,Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Encodes Cardiac Transcriptional Reprogramming in Human Ischemic Heart Failure [DNA Methylation],"Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is the clinical endpoint of coronary heart disease and a leading cause of heart failure. Despite growing demands to develop personalized approaches to treat ICM, progress is limited by inadequate knowledge of its pathogenesis. Since epigenetics has been implicated in the development of other chronic diseases, the current study was designed to determine whether transcriptional and/or epigenetic changes are sufficient to distinguish ICM from other etiologies of heart failure. Specifically, we hypothesize that genome-wide DNA methylation encodes transcriptional reprogramming in ICM. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on human ischemic left ventricular tissue obtained from patients with end-stage heart failure, which enriched known targets of the polycomb methyltransferase EZH2 compared to non-ischemic hearts. Combined RNA sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed a robust gene expression pattern consistent with suppression of oxidative metabolism, induced anaerobic glycolysis, and altered cellular remodeling. Lastly, KLF15 was identified as a putative upstream regulator of metabolic gene expression that was itself regulated by EZH2 in a SET domain-dependent manner. Our observations therefore define a novel role of DNA methylation in the metabolic reprogramming of ICM. Furthermore, we identify EZH2 as an epigenetic regulator of KLF15 along with DNA hypermethylation, and we propose a novel mechanism through which coronary heart disease reprograms the expression of both intermediate enzymes and upstream regulators of cardiac metabolism such as KLF15.","['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human', 'Heart Failure/*genetics/metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Cardiovascular', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'protein', 'Gene family report', 'Protein sequence', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Article report', 'Article', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'MAT', 'Cardiology', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Compound name', 'Cardinality', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Recombination detection', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"

Of 4,759 regulated lncRNAs, function-oriented filters yield 359 tissue-specifically regulated and metabolically sensitive lncRNAs that are predicted by lncRNA-mRNA correlation analyses to function in diverse aspects of energy metabolism. Specific regulations of liver metabolically sensitive lncRNAs (lncLMS) by nutrients, metabolic hormones, and key transcription factors were further defined in primary hepatocytes. Combining genome-wide screens, bioinformatics function predictions, and cell-based analyses, we developed an integrative roadmap to identify lncRNA metabolic regulators.

36472361,"Analysis of leaves of wild-type and rice COI mutants treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Results provide the role of rice COI on response to jasmonic acid.
Expression profiling in wild-type and COI mutatns leaves treated with or without 0.5 mM methy jasmonate was analyzed using one-color method with three biological replicates.","Jasmonic acid (JA) regulates plant growth, development and stress responses. Coronatine insensitive 1 (COI1) and jasmonate zinc-finger inflorescence meristem-domain (JAZ) proteins form a receptor complex for jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine, a biologically active form of JA. Three COIs (OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b and OsCOI2) are encoded in the rice genome. In the present study, we generated mutants for each rice COI gene using genome editing to reveal the physiological functions of the three rice COIs. The oscoi2 mutants, but not the oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants, exhibited severely low fertility, indicating the crucial role of OsCOI2 in rice fertility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional changes after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment were moderate in the leaves of oscoi2 mutants compared to those in the wild type or oscoi1a and oscoi1b mutants. MeJA-induced chlorophyll degradation and accumulation of antimicrobial secondary metabolites were suppressed in oscoi2 mutants. These results indicate that OsCOI2 plays a central role in JA response in rice leaves. In contrast, the assessment of growth inhibition upon exogenous application of JA to seedlings of each mutant revealed that rice COIs are redundantly involved in shoot growth, whereas OsCOI2 plays a primary role in root growth. In addition, a co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that OsJAZ2 and OsJAZ5 containing divergent Jas motifs physically interacted only with OsCOI2, whereas OsJAZ4 with a canonical Jas motif interacts with all three rice COIs. The present study demonstrated the functional diversity of rice COIs, thereby providing clues to the mechanisms regulating the various physiological functions of JA.","['*Arabidopsis Proteins/metabolism', '*Arabidopsis/genetics', '*Oryza/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Editing', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology/metabolism', 'Oxylipins/pharmacology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell cycle', 'Editing', 'Sequence editing', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'PHYLIP format']"

We show that PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy, in contrast to PD-1 monotherapy, substantially changes the differentiation program of the PD-1<sup>+</sup>TCF1<sup>+</sup> stem-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and results in the generation of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that resemble highly functional effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seen after an acute viral infection.

Our results show that the PD-1<sup>+</sup>TCF1<sup>+</sup> stem-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, also referred to as precursors of exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, are not fate-locked into the exhaustion program and their differentiation trajectory can be changed by IL-2 signals.

Refer to individual Series","In addition to KIT and PDGFRA mutations, sequential accumulation of other genetic events is involved in the development and progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Until recently, the significance of these other alterations has not been thoroughly investigated. We report the first study that integrates gene expression profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number analyses in GIST. Fresh tissue specimens from 25 patients with GIST were collected, and gene expression profiling and high-resolution genomic copy number analyses were performed, using Affymetrix U133Plus and SNP array 6.0. We found that all 21 mutant GIST patients showed both macroscopic cytogenetic alterations and cryptic microdeletions or amplifications, whereas 75% (three of four) of wild-type patients with GIST did not show genomic imbalances. The most frequently observed chromosomal alterations in patients with mutant GIST included 14q complete or partial deletion (17 of 25), 1p deletion (14 of 25) and 22q deletion (10 of 25). Genetic targets of the chromosomal aberrations were selected by integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression data. We detected the involvement of known oncogenes and tumor suppressors including KRAS in chr 12p amplification and KIF1B, PPM1A, NF2 in chr 1p, 14q and 22p deletions, respectively. The genomic segment most frequently altered in mutated samples was the 14q23.1 region, which contains potentially novel tumor suppressors, including DAAM1, RTN1 and DACT1. siRNA-mediated RTN1 downregulation showed evidence for the potential role in GIST pathogenesis.

33472891,Gene expression profile of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with BRCA1 pseudogene (BRCA1P1) knockout (KO),"Innate immune defense mechanisms play a pivotal role in antitumor responses. Recent evidence suggests that antiviral innate immunity is regulated not only by exogenous non-self-RNA but also by host-derived pseudogene RNAs. A growing body of evidence also indicates a biological role for pseudogenes as gene expression regulators or immune modulators. Here, we report an important role for <i>BRCA1P1</i>, the pseudogene of the <i>BRCA1</i> tumor-suppressor gene, in regulating innate immune defense mechanisms in breast cancer cells. <i>BRCA1P1</i> expresses a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in breast cancer cells through divergent transcription. Expression of lncRNA-<i>BRCA1P1</i> is increased in breast tumors compared with normal breast tissues. Depletion of <i>BRCA1P1</i> induces an antiviral defense-like program, including the expression of antiviral genes in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, <i>BRCA1P1</i>-deficient cancer cells mimic virus-infected cells by stimulating cytokines and inducing cell apoptosis. Accordingly, depletion of <i>BRCA1P1</i> increases host innate immune responses and restricts virus replication. In converse, overexpression of <i>BRCA1P1</i> reduces cytokine expression in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, lncRNA-<i>BRCA1P1</i> is localized in the nucleus, binds to the NF-κB subunit RelA, and negatively regulates antiviral gene expression. Finally, in a xenograft mouse model of breast cancer, depletion of <i>BRCA1P1</i> stimulates cytokine expression and local immunity, and suppresses tumor growth. Our results suggest an important role for <i>BRCA1P1</i> in innate immune defense mechanisms and antitumor responses. This mechanism of antiviral immunity regulated by a host-derived pseudogene RNA may guide the development of novel therapies targeting immune responses in breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies a novel mechanism of innate immunity driven by a host pseudogene RNA that inhibits innate immune defense mechanisms and antitumor responses through regulation of antiviral gene expression.","['Animals', 'Breast/pathology/surgery', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*genetics/immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Host Microbial Interactions/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Mastectomy', 'Mice', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Pseudogenes/*physiology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Respirovirus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Sendai virus/immunology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics', 'Tumor Escape/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BEAST', 'Yeast', 'rast', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell cycle', 'nucleotide', 'Cell type accession', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'Protein interactions', 'Microbial collection', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Anatomy', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Locus ID (PseudoCAP)', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA', 'Infectious disease', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Cytoscape input file format', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
30778188,Diversity of cytosine methylation across the fungi tree of life,"The generation of thousands of fungal genomes is leading to a better understanding of genes and genomic organization within the kingdom. However, the epigenome, which includes DNA and chromatin modifications, remains poorly investigated in fungi. Large comparative studies in animals and plants have deepened our understanding of epigenomic variation, particularly of the modified base 5-methylcytosine (5mC), but taxonomic sampling of disparate groups is needed to develop unifying explanations for 5mC variation. Here, we utilize the largest phylogenetic resolution of 5mC methyltransferases (5mC MTases) and genome evolution to better understand levels and patterns of 5mC across fungi. We show that extant 5mC MTase genotypes are descendent from ancestral maintenance and de novo genotypes, whereas the 5mC MTases DIM-2 and RID are more recently derived, and that 5mC levels are correlated with 5mC MTase genotype and transposon content. Our survey also revealed that fungi lack canonical gene-body methylation, which distinguishes fungal epigenomes from certain insect and plant species. However, some fungal species possess independently derived clusters of contiguous 5mC encompassing many genes.

We asked whether TGF-β1 controls the cell cycle status of HSCs in vitro to enhance the reconstitution activity. To examine the effect of TGF-β1 on the HSC function, we used an in vitro culture system in which single HSCs divide with the retention of their short- and long-term reconstitution ability. Extensive single-cell analyses showed that, regardless of its concentration, TGF-β1 slowed down the cell cycle progression of HSCs but consequently suppressed their self-renewal potential. Cycling HSCs were not able to go back to quiescence with TGF-β1. This study revealed a negative role of TGF-β1 in the regulation of the HSC number and reconstitution activity.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
20123709,Mycoplasma gallisepticum str. R(high) whole genome sequencing project,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a significant respiratory and reproductive pathogen of domestic poultry. While the complete genomic sequence of the virulent, low-passage M. gallisepticum strain R (R(low)) has been reported, genomic determinants responsible for differences in virulence and host range remain to be completely identified. Here, we utilize genome sequencing and microarray-based comparative genomic data to identify these genomic determinants of virulence and to elucidate genomic variability among strains of M. gallisepticum. Analysis of the high-passage, attenuated derivative of R(low), R(high), indicated that relatively few total genomic changes (64 loci) occurred, yet they are potentially responsible for the observed attenuation of this strain. In addition to previously characterized mutations in cytadherence-related proteins, changes included those in coding sequences of genes involved in sugar metabolism. Analyses of the genome of the M. gallisepticum vaccine strain F revealed numerous differences relative to strain R, including a highly divergent complement of vlhA surface lipoprotein genes, and at least 16 genes absent or significantly fragmented relative to strain R. Notably, an R(low) isogenic mutant in one of these genes (MGA_1107) caused significantly fewer severe tracheal lesions in the natural host compared to virulent M. gallisepticum R(low). Comparative genomic hybridizations indicated few genetic loci commonly affected in F and vaccine strains ts-11 and 6/85, which would correlate with proteins affecting strain R virulence. Together, these data provide novel insights into inter- and intrastrain M. gallisepticum genomic variability and the genetic basis of M. gallisepticum virulence.","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*veterinary', 'Mycoplasma gallisepticum/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Poultry Diseases/*microbiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Virulence Factors/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Comparative genomics', 'Protein modelling', 'Genome comparison', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Genetic variation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Infectious disease', 'Protein interactions', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Disease ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Virulence prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Virus identifier']"
29907599,JAK1/2 inhibitor therapy-associated lymphomas in myelofibrosis arising from a pre-existing B-cell clone,"Inhibition of Janus-kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) is a mainstay to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Sporadic observations reported the co-incidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas during treatment of MPN with JAK1/2 inhibitors. We assessed 626 patients with MPN, including 69 with myelofibrosis receiving JAK1/2 inhibitors for lymphoma development. B-cell lymphomas evolved in 4 (5.8%) of 69 patients receiving JAK1/2 inhibition compared with 2 (0.36%) of 557 with conventional treatment (16-fold increased risk). A similar 15-fold increase was observed in an independent cohort of 929 patients with MPN. Considering primary myelofibrosis only (N = 216), 3 lymphomas were observed in 31 inhibitor-treated patients (9.7%) vs 1 (0.54%) of 185 control patients. Lymphomas were of aggressive B-cell type, extranodal, or leukemic with high MYC expression in the absence of <i>JAK2</i> V617F or other MPN-associated mutations. Median time from initiation of inhibitor therapy to lymphoma diagnosis was 25 months. Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were already detected in the bone marrow during myelofibrosis in 16.3% of patients. Lymphomas occurring during JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment were preceded by a preexisting B-cell clone in all 3 patients tested. Sequencing verified clonal identity in 2 patients. The effects of JAK1/2 inhibition were mirrored in <i>Stat1</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice: 16 of 24 mice developed a spontaneous myeloid hyperplasia with the concomitant presence of aberrant B cells. Transplantations of bone marrow from diseased mice unmasked the outgrowth of a malignant B-cell clone evolving into aggressive B-cell leukemia-lymphoma. We conclude that JAK/STAT1 pathway inhibition in myelofibrosis is associated with an elevated frequency of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Detection of a preexisting B-cell clone may identify individuals at risk.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Retrospective Studies']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Kinase name', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gramene primary identifier', 'InterPro accession', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Protein data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum', 'Protein active sites']"

Thus, identification of epigenetic modifiers essential for oncogenic transcriptional programs is a key to designing effective therapeutics for this deadly disease. Here we report that Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) is highly expressed in GBM and correlated with poor prognosis. The silencing or inactivation of PRMT2 inhibits GBM cell growth and glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal in vitro, and suppresses orthotopic tumor growth, accompanied with significant deregulation of genes mainly associated with cell cycle progression and pathways in cancer. Mechanistically PRMT2 is responsible for H3R8 asymmetric methylation (H3R8me2a), whose enrichment at promoters and enhancers is closely correlated with known active histone marks and is required for the maintenance of target gene expression. Together, this study demonstrates that PRMT2 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for oncogenic gene expression programs in GBM pathogenesis and provides a rationale for PRMT2 targeting in aggressive gliomas.","['Arginine/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', '*Oncogenes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Data mining', 'Sequence merging', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein data', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

However, whether neutrophils can intrinsically titrate their immune response remains unknown. Here we conditionally deleted the Spi1 gene, which encodes the myeloid transcription factor PU.1, from neutrophils of mice undergoing fungal infection and then performed comprehensive epigenomic profiling. We found that as well as providing the transcriptional prerequisite for eradicating pathogens, the predominant function of PU.1 was to restrain the neutrophil defense by broadly inhibiting the accessibility of enhancers via the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1. Such epigenetic modifications impeded the immunostimulatory AP-1 transcription factor JUNB from entering chromatin and activating its targets. Thus, neutrophils rely on a PU.1-installed inhibitor program to safeguard their epigenome from undergoing uncontrolled activation, protecting the host against an exorbitant innate immune response.","['Animals', 'Candida albicans/immunology/physiology', 'Candidiasis/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'Disease Resistance/genetics/immunology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*immunology', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcriptome/genetics/immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease report', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Active site prediction', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
21392141,Buchnera aphidicola LL01 genome sequencing project,"The pervasive influence of resident microorganisms on the phenotype of their hosts is exemplified by the intracellular bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, which provides its aphid partner with essential amino acids (EAAs). We investigated variation in the dietary requirement for EAAs among four pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) clones. Buchnera-derived nitrogen contributed to the synthesis of all EAAs for which aphid clones required a dietary supply, and to none of the EAAs for which all four clones had no dietary requirement, suggesting that low total dietary nitrogen may select for reduced synthesis of certain EAAs in some aphid clones. The sequenced Buchnera genomes showed that the EAA nutritional phenotype (i.e. the profile of dietary EAAs required by the aphid) cannot be attributed to sequence variation of Buchnera genes coding EAA biosynthetic enzymes. Metabolic modelling by flux balance analysis demonstrated that EAA output from Buchnera can be determined precisely by the flux of host metabolic precursors to Buchnera. Specifically, the four EAA nutritional phenotypes could be reproduced by metabolic models with unique profiles of host inputs, dominated by variation in supply of aspartate, homocysteine and glutamate. This suggests that the nutritional phenotype of the symbiosis is determined principally by host metabolism and transporter genes that regulate nutrient supply to Buchnera. Intraspecific variation in the nutritional phenotype of symbioses is expected to mediate partitioning of plant resources among aphid genotypes, potentially promoting the genetic subdivision of aphid populations. In this way, microbial symbioses may play an important role in the evolutionary diversification of phytophagous insects.","['Amino Acids, Essential/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Aphids/*metabolism/*microbiology', 'Bacteria/*genetics/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Buchnera/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Symbiosis/genetics/*physiology']","['Amino acid identifier', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Lipids', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Generation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"
30046000,Effects of Hnf4a deletion in the nephron lineage during kidney development,"Different nephron tubule segments perform distinct physiological functions, collectively acting as a blood filtration unit. Dysfunction of the proximal tubule segment can lead to Fanconi renotubular syndrome (FRTS), with major symptoms such as excess excretion of water, glucose, and phosphate in the urine. It has been shown that a mutation in HNF4A is associated with FRTS in humans and that Hnf4a is expressed specifically in proximal tubules in adult rat nephrons. However, little is known about the role of Hnf4a in nephrogenesis. Here, we found that Hnf4a is expressed in both presumptive and differentiated proximal tubules in the developing mouse kidney. We show that Hnf4a is required for the formation of differentiated proximal tubules but is dispensable for the formation of presumptive proximal tubules. Furthermore, we show that loss of Hnf4a decreased the expression of proximal tubule-specific genes. Adult Hnf4a mutant mice presented with FRTS-like symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, glycosuria, and phosphaturia. Analysis of the adult Hnf4a mutant kidney also showed proximal tubule dysgenesis and nephrocalcinosis.

Here we studied the selective resilience of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ∼80% of RGCs within 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 46 RGC types in adult retina. We then tracked their survival after ONC; characterized transcriptomic, physiological, and morphological changes that preceded degeneration; and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, using loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo, we showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury and demonstrates that differential gene expression can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention.","['Animals', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nerve Crush', 'Nerve Regeneration/*genetics', 'Neuroprotection/*genetics', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/*physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Selection detection', 'Protein feature detection']"
31932738,"We employed RNA sequecing to profile large RNAs (mRNAs and lincRNAs) packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) from WT cells and cells deficient for the LC3 conjugation machinery
EVs from wild-type, ATG7-/- and ATG12-/- HEK293T cells and corresponding cell samples were collected after 24h of serum starvation. Total RNA from wild-type, ATG7-/- and ATG12-/- HEK293T EVs and cells was isolated and used for the preparation of uniquely barcoded large RNA sequencing libraries (n=3). Results of single-end 50 base pair sequencing on two separate lanes of a HiSeq4000 for these samples revealed negligible differences in the large RNA profiles of EVs from ATG7-/- and ATG12-/- cells relative to EVs from wild-type cells. These results suggest that large RNAs are packaged into EVs via mechanisms independent of the LC3 conjugation machinery.","Traditionally viewed as an autodigestive pathway, autophagy also facilitates cellular secretion; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that components of the autophagy machinery specify secretion within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Using a proximity-dependent biotinylation proteomics strategy, we identify 200 putative targets of LC3-dependent secretion. This secretome consists of a highly interconnected network enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and EV cargoes. Proteomic and RNA profiling of EVs identifies diverse RBPs and small non-coding RNAs requiring the LC3-conjugation machinery for packaging and secretion. Focusing on two RBPs, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) and scaffold-attachment factor B (SAFB), we demonstrate that these proteins interact with LC3 and are secreted within EVs enriched with lipidated LC3. Furthermore, their secretion requires the LC3-conjugation machinery, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and LC3-dependent recruitment of factor associated with nSMase2 activity (FAN). Hence, the LC3-conjugation pathway controls EV cargo loading and secretion.","['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/deficiency/genetics', 'Animals', 'Autophagosomes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Autophagy/*genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/deficiency/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Biotinylation', 'Extracellular Vesicles/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'RNA, Small Untranslated/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/genetics/metabolism']","['Protein report', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Ribosomes', 'Chromosomes', 'protein', 'Protein topology', 'Image metadata', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'PolyA signal detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Data retrieval', 'Feature extraction', 'Relation extraction', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'nucleotide', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'S/MAR prediction', 'Matrix/scaffold attachment sites', 'Matrix', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Rate of association', 'Matrix format', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'raw', 'Raw sequence', 'Raw image', 'RNA-Seq', 'DNA translation', 'RNA', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Phosphorylation sites']"

19210792,"A casual look at the behavior and function of animals and plants clearly shows that many physiological processes are periodic and tied to cyclical changes in a day.  As suggested by the persistence of some rhythms in the absence of external cues, organisms are able to anticipate changes in the daily environment with an internal oscillator know as the circadian clock.  Transcription is an important mechanism in maintaining these oscillations.  Here we explore, using whole genome tiling arrays, the extent of rhythmic expression patterns genome wide, with an unbiased analysis of coding and noncoding regions of the Arabidopsis genome.  As in previous studies, we detected a circadian rhythm for approximately 25% of the protein coding genes in the genome.  With an unbiased interrogation of the genome, extensive rhythmic introns were detected predominantly in phase with adjacent rhythmic exons creating a transcript that if translated would be expected to produce a truncated protein.  In some cases such as the MYB transcription factor PHOSPATE STARVATION RESPONSE1, an intron was found to exhibit a circadian rhythm while the remainder of the transcript was otherwise arrhythmic.  In addition to several known non-coding transcripts including miRNA, trans-acting siRNA, and snoRNA, greater than one thousand intergenic regions were detected as circadian clock regulated, many of which have no predicted function, either coding or non-coding.  Nearly 7% of the protein coding genes produced rhythmic antisense transcripts, often for genes whose sense strand was not similarly rhythmic. This study revealed widespread circadian clock regulation of the Arabidopsis genome extending well beyond the protein coding transcripts measured to date.  This suggests a greater level of structural and temporal dynamics than previously known.
Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana accession Col-0 were grown on MS media (supplemented with 2% D-glucose and solidified with 1% agar) 7 days in 12 h light:12 h dark cycles under white fluorescent bulbs at 100 mmol m-2 s-1 before release to constant light and temperature. Samples were collected every 4 h beginning at the time of lights on, ZT0.  Single perfect matches, without a 2nd partial match of >18/25 bp were selected giving a total of 1,683,620 unique features.  These were mapped to annotated mRNAs as intron, exon, inter-genic region, or flanking probes which span an annotated boundary. Hybridization efficiencies of oligonucleotide probes on tiling arrays vary considerably and some probes tend to be unresponsive.  Thus, to avoid spurious decrease of signal in the spectral analysis from poorly responsive probes, we filtered out probes which are lowly expressed (mean < 3) and furthermore show very little variation (standard deviation < 0.25) across the time series leaving a total of 1,609,258 features between both the forward and reverse strand arrays.  The twelve measurements for each probes were standardized and Fourier analysis was used to evaluate the RNA expression pattern over the two-day time course.  To exploit redundancy of features we grouped all probes for the same exon based on the TAIR7 genome annotation, or applied 200 bp windows centered on each intronic or intergenic probe position while stopping at exon boundaries.  We then computed the 24-h spectral power F24 from the average of the standardized probes within a group. To assess the significance of these F24 scores, we built empirical null distributions that take into account the number of probes (weight) that went into the calculation of the spectral power. The family of null distributions was calibrated from the distribution of scores of all probes annotated as intergenic. We parametrized these distributions as exponential functions which gave excellent fits. The p-values for all features were then computed from the fitted distributions.  The labeling method which used oligo dT for first strand amplification of the RNA produces a 3’ biased probes; therefore, any annotation unit with at least two features satisfying p < 0.005 was considered circadian regulated.

The Salmonella Type III Secretion System encoded at Pathogenicity Island I (SPI-1) translocates the Salmonella effector proteins SipA, SopA, SopB, SopD, and SopE2 into the host epithelial cell cytoplasm. These five effector proteins act in concert to induce fluid secretion and transcription of C-X-C chemokines, which serve to recruit PMNs to the intestine. While the individual molecular interactions of these Salmonella proteins with cultured host cells have been extensively characterized, their combined role in the generation of fluid secretion and inflammation is less well understood.  A bovine ligated ileal loop model was used in conjunction with a custom bovine microarray to determine intestinal response to acute S. Typhimurium infection in the calf.  Gene expression responses to both wild type S. Typhimurium a delta sipA, sopABDE2 mutant were measured at seven times during the initial 12 hours of infection.   Microarray analysis confirmed increased expression of genes encoding proteins previously associated with immune response to Salmonella spp. infection.  Gene expression changes were mapped to molecular interaction pathways and changes in expression of mechanistic genes, which are defined as perturbed genes identified by Bayesian genetic network modeling, were strongly involved in the mechanisms of the host immune response.  In addition to correctly identifying known effects of wild type S. Typhimurium on host (bovine) gene expression, Bayesian genetic network modeling identified novel effects of S. Typhimurium on several molecular interaction pathways.  Novel effects impacted gene regulation in the following pathways: adipocytokine signaling, insulin signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, axon guidance, gap junction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, long-term depression, long-term potentiation,  melanogenesis, and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity.  Known effects were observed in the following pathways: regulation of actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), MAPK signaling, calcium signaling, Jak-STAT signaling, leukocyte transendothelial migration, adherens junction, tight junction, and ECM-receptor interactions, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and antigen processing and presentation.  Quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify the expression of some of these mechanistic genes.
Microarrays were used to examine the transcriptional profiles of bovine intestinal epithelia infected with wild type Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (control and wild type or delta sipA sopABDE2 mutant infected) across seven time points (15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours).  Experiments were performed in quadruplicate (bovine ligated ileal loops surgeries were performed with four calves), generateing a total of 84 arrays.","Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium (S.

While individual molecular interactions of the effectors with cultured host cells have been characterized, their combined role in intestinal fluid secretion and inflammation is less understood. We hypothesized that comparison of the bovine intestinal mucosal response to wild type Salmonella and a SipA, SopABDE2 effector mutant relative to uninfected bovine ileum would reveal heretofore unidentified diarrhea-associated host cellular pathways. To determine the coordinated effects of these virulence factors, a bovine ligated ileal loop model was used to measure responses to wild type S. Typhimurium (WT) and a ΔsipA, sopABDE2 mutant (MUT) across 12 hours of infection using a bovine microarray. Data were analyzed using standard microarray analysis and a dynamic bayesian network modeling approach (DBN). Both analytical methods confirmed increased expression of immune response genes to Salmonella infection and novel gene expression. Gene expression changes mapped to 219 molecular interaction pathways and 1620 gene ontology groups.

Here, we identified the lysosomal endoribonuclease RNase T2 as a non-redundant upstream component of TLR8-dependent RNA recognition. RNase T2 activity is required for rendering complex single-stranded, exogenous RNA molecules detectable for TLR8. This is due to RNase T2's preferential cleavage of single-stranded RNA molecules between purine and uridine residues, which critically contributes to the supply of catabolic uridine and the generation of purine-2',3'-cyclophosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides. Thus-generated molecules constitute agonistic ligands for the first and second binding pocket of TLR8.

31239516,KLF4 as a rheostat of osteolysis and osteogenesis in prostate tumors in the bone,"We previously showed that KLF4, a gene highly expressed in murine prostate stem cells, blocks the progression of indolent intraepithelial prostatic lesions into aggressive and rapidly growing tumors. Here, we show that the anti-tumorigenic effect of KLF4 extends to PC3 human prostate cancer cells growing in the bone. We compared KLF4 null cells with cells transduced with a DOX-inducible KLF4 expression system, and find KLF4 function inhibits PC3 growth in monolayer and soft agar cultures. Furthermore, KLF4 null cells proliferate rapidly, forming large, invasive, and osteolytic tumors when injected into mouse femurs, whereas KLF4 re-expression immediately after their intra-femoral inoculation blocks tumor development and preserves a normal bone architecture. KLF4 re-expression in established KLF4 null bone tumors inhibits their osteolytic effects, preventing bone fractures and inducing an osteogenic response with new bone formation. In addition to these profound biological changes, KLF4 also induces a transcriptional shift from an osteolytic program in KLF4 null cells to an osteogenic program. Importantly, bioinformatic analysis shows that genes regulated by KLF4 overlap significantly with those expressed in metastatic prostate cancer patients and in three individual cohorts with bone metastases, strengthening the clinical relevance of the findings in our xenograft model.","['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osteolysis/*physiopathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Heterogen annotation', 'R script', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Analysis', 'Protein cleavage sites and proteolysis', 'Protein analysis']"
30802596,Stewartia ovata isolate:ovata Genome sequencing and assembly,"Phylogenetic analyses using diverse datasets can yield conflicting inference of evolutionary history. Phylogenetic conflicts observed in both animal and plant systems have often been explained by two competing (but not mutually exclusive) hypotheses, i.e., hybridization vs. incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The likelihood of either process contributing to phylogenetic conflict in a given group is context-dependent, involving attributes of life history, distribution, and phylogeny, among others. Here we explore phylogenetic conflict in Stewartia s.l., a genus with ca. 20 species of trees and shrubs from the tea family (Theaceae) disjunctly distributed between eastern Asia (EAS) and eastern North America (ENA). We use both restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and complete plastome sequence data to reconstruct the phylogeny of the group using concatenation and coalescence approaches. Our results indicate strong conflicts between the topologies reconstructed using nuclear and plastid data. Four-taxon D-statistic (ABBA-BABA) tests detected prevailing signals of introgression. Bayesian Analysis of Macro-evolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) inferred that species diversification occurred in the middle to late Miocene. Ancestral range reconstructions indicated co-distribution of ancestral species (represented by internal nodes) for both the Hartia clade (in southern China) and the EAS Stewartia s.s. clade (Japan Archipelago and the Yangtze Valley of China). The latter clade experienced multiple events of dispersal and vicariance during its diversification history. Ancient introgressive hybridization following species diversification in the mid- to late-Miocene likely caused diverging histories in the nuclear and plastid genomes, leading to phylogenetic conflict in Stewartia s.l. Our study indicates that species diversification driven by both the intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon since the late Miocene and reduced risks of extinction due to frequent dispersal possibly via East China Sea Land Bridge impacted the anomalous species richness between EAS and ENA.

Although this capacity was recognized long ago, our mechanistic understanding of the establishment, maintenance, and erasure of cellular identities in plants remains limited. Here, we develop a cell-type-specific reprogramming system that can be probed at the genome-wide scale for alterations in gene expression and histone modifications. We show that relationships among H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and gene expression in single cell types mirror trends from complex tissue, and that H3K27me3 dynamics regulate guard cell identity. Further, upon initiation of reprogramming, guard cells induce H3K27me3-mediated repression of a regulator of wound-induced callus formation, suggesting that cells in intact tissues may have mechanisms to sense and resist inappropriate dedifferentiation. The matched ChIP-sequencing (seq) and RNA-seq datasets created for this analysis also serve as a resource enabling inquiries into the dynamic and global-scale distribution of histone modifications in single cell types in plants.","['Arabidopsis/*cytology/metabolism', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Plant Stomata/metabolism', '*Transcriptome']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Histogram', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
32231311,"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) pioneer transcription factors Myod1 and Ascl1 are biochemically related but produce fundamentally different outcomes when expressed in fibroblasts: Myod1 produces muscle cells and Ascl1 induces neurons. Here, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms explaining the differential activity. Surprisingly, we found a large overlap in the overall binding patterns of Ascl1 and Myod1 in fibroblasts, with both transcription factors accessing both neuronal and myogenic targets. We also observed similar changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation.  Yet, Myod1 predominantly induced a muscle program and Ascl1 a neuronal program. We found that differences in binding affinity at key targets resulted in largely distinct reprogramming outcomes. Accordingly, exchanging Myod1’s C-terminal protein-protein interacting domain and DNA-binding basic domain with those of Ascl1 induces an Ascl1-like binding and converts Myod1 into a pro-neuronal factor. Finally, we found that co-expression of Myod1 with the transcriptional repressor Myt1l inhibits induction of the muscle program and yields functional neuronal cells. Our findings are compatible with the notion that pioneer factor activity is associated with high-affinity protein-DNA and suggest that promiscuous binding of pioneer factors can induce unspecific lineage features which need to be kept in check by co-factor interactions.
FLAG ChIP-seq was performed 48hr post-dox induction on: mESC+rtTA (control), mESC+flagAscl1, mESC+flagMyod1.","The on-target pioneer factors Ascl1 and Myod1 are sequence-related but induce two developmentally unrelated lineages-that is, neuronal and muscle identities, respectively. It is unclear how these two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors mediate such fundamentally different outcomes. The chromatin binding of Ascl1 and Myod1 was surprisingly similar in fibroblasts, yet their transcriptional outputs were drastically different. We found that quantitative binding differences explained differential chromatin remodelling and gene activation. Although strong Ascl1 binding was exclusively associated with bHLH motifs, strong Myod1-binding sites were co-enriched with non-bHLH motifs, possibly explaining why Ascl1 is less context dependent. Finally, we observed that promiscuous binding of Myod1 to neuronal targets results in neuronal reprogramming when the muscle program is inhibited by Myt1l. Our findings suggest that chromatin access of on-target pioneer factors is primarily driven by the protein-DNA interaction, unlike ordinary context-dependent transcription factors, and that promiscuous transcription factor binding requires specific silencing mechanisms to ensure lineage fidelity.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MyoD Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Software engineering', 'Workflow format', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Proteins', 'Biobank', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

30332632,RNA sequencing of genetically engineered mouse model lung tumors and normal mouse lung.,"The major types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma-have distinct immune microenvironments. We developed a genetic model of squamous NSCLC on the basis of overexpression of the transcription factor Sox2, which specifies lung basal cell fate, and loss of the tumor suppressor Lkb1 (SL mice). SL tumors recapitulated gene-expression and immune-infiltrate features of human squamous NSCLC; such features included enrichment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and decreased expression of NKX2-1, a transcriptional regulator that specifies alveolar cell fate. In Kras-driven adenocarcinomas, mis-expression of Sox2 or loss of Nkx2-1 led to TAN recruitment. TAN recruitment involved SOX2-mediated production of the chemokine CXCL5. Deletion of Nkx2-1 in SL mice (SNL) revealed that NKX2-1 suppresses SOX2-driven squamous tumorigenesis by repressing adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation. Depletion of TANs in SNL mice reduced squamous tumors, suggesting that TANs foster squamous cell fate. Thus, lineage-defining transcription factors determine the tumor immune microenvironment, which in turn might impact the nature of the tumor.","['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/*immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid map', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways']"

In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation.

30402543,Multiple modes of PRC2 inhibition elicit global chromatin alterations in H3K27M pediatric glioma,"A methionine substitution at lysine-27 on histone H3 variants (H3K27M) characterizes ~80% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) and inhibits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in a dominant-negative fashion. Yet, the mechanisms for this inhibition and abnormal epigenomic landscape have not been resolved. Using quantitative proteomics, we discovered that robust PRC2 inhibition requires levels of H3K27M greatly exceeding those of PRC2, seen in DIPG. While PRC2 inhibition requires interaction with H3K27M, we found that this interaction on chromatin is transient, with PRC2 largely being released from H3K27M. Unexpectedly, inhibition persisted even after PRC2 dissociated from H3K27M-containing chromatin, suggesting a lasting impact on PRC2. Furthermore, allosterically activated PRC2 is particularly sensitive to H3K27M, leading to the failure to spread H3K27me from PRC2 recruitment sites and consequently abrogating PRC2's ability to establish H3K27me2-3 repressive chromatin domains. In turn, levels of polycomb antagonists such as H3K36me2 are elevated, suggesting a more global, downstream effect on the epigenome. Together, these findings reveal the conditions required for H3K27M-mediated PRC2 inhibition and reconcile seemingly paradoxical effects of H3K27M on PRC2 recruitment and activity.","['Animals', 'Brain Stem Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Glioma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report']"
30445039,Sensory Food Perception Rapidly Primes Postprandial ER-Homeostasis through Melanorcortin-Dependent Control of Liver mTOR Activation,"Adaptation of liver to the postprandial state requires coordinated regulation of protein synthesis and folding aligned with changes in lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception. Collectively, our experiments unravel that sensory food perception coordinately primes postprandial liver ER adaption through a melanocortin-SNA-mTOR-Xbp1s axis.

20736300,"Adult human fibroblasts derived from the dermis of 4 mm punch biopsies taken from the lower backs of 15 healthy subjects of 3 different phototypes (types I, III and VI). This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Hamburg. Subjects with type I skin were #4, 12, 15, 19 and 26; subjects with type III skin were # 6, 9, 13, 14 and 23, and subjects with type VI skin were # 7, 8, 16, 17 and 28. The fibroblasts were cultured from the biopsies and were grown in monolayer culture in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% L-glutamine plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Fibroblasts were subcultured using routine methods and were used at passages 3 to 6.
Oligo-cDNA microarray hybridization was performed according to the National Cancer Institute in-house protocol, as detailed previously (Yamaguchi et al., 2008). Briefly, total RNAs were prepared from cultured fibroblasts using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality (purity and integrity) and quantity of each total RNA preparation was measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). A universal human reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a control. cDNA samples generated from RNA samples and purified before the coupling reaction were labeled with Cy3 (for fibroblast samples) or Cy5 (for reference RNA) mono-reactive dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and were hybridized simultaneously on an oligo-DNA chip (Hs-OperonV3.0-v1p24, p27, p31) overnight at 42°C. Two fluorescent intensities of the oligo-DNA chip were scanned using a microarray scanner (GenePix 4000B; Axon Instruments Inc., Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Differential gene expression was profiled using Genepix Pro 5.0 software and was analyzed by Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).","Interactions between melanocytes and neighboring cells in the skin are important in regulating skin color in humans. We recently demonstrated that the less pigmented and thicker skin on the palms and soles is regulated by underlying fibroblasts in those areas, specifically via a secreted factor (DKK1) that modulates Wnt signaling. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dermal fibroblasts regulate the constitutive skin color of individuals ranging from very light to very dark. We used microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns in fibroblasts derived from lighter skin types compared to darker skin types, with a focus on secreted proteins. We identified a number of genes that differ dramatically in expression and, among the expressed proteins, neuregulin-1, which is secreted by fibroblasts derived from dark skin, effectively increases the pigmentation of melanocytes in tissue culture and in an artificial skin model and regulates their growth, suggesting that it is one of the major factors determining human skin color.","['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanocytes/*metabolism', 'Neuregulin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Skin/*metabolism', '*Skin Pigmentation']","['Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'ELAND format', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Sequence masking', 'Laboratory animal science']"

In this study, in silico analyses of the lysine histone demethylases (KDMs) involved in diverse biological processes and diseases revealed that PHD finger protein 8 (PHF8, KDM7B) was significantly associated with poor clinical outcome in HER2-negative GC. The depletion of PHF8 significantly reduced cancer progression in GC cells and in mouse xenografts. PHF8 regulated genes involved in cell migration/motility based on a microarray analysis. Of note, PHF8 interacted with c-Jun on the promoter of <i>PRKCA</i> which encodes PKCα. The depletion of PHF8 or PKCα greatly up-regulated PTEN expression, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of a PKCα expression vector or an active Src. These suggest that PTEN destabilization occurs mainly via the PKCα-Src axis. GC cells treated with midostaurin or bosutinib significantly suppressed migration in vitro and in zebrafish models. Immunohistochemical analyses of PHF8, PKCα, and PTEN showed a positive correlation between PHF8 and PKCα but negative correlations between PHF8 and PTEN and between PKCα and PTEN. Moreover, high PHF8-PKCα expression was significantly correlated with worse prognosis. Together, our results suggest that the PKCα-Src-PTEN pathway regulated by PHF8/c-Jun is a potential prognostic/therapeutic target in HER2-negative advanced GC.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'Kinase name', 'Protein chain (C-alpha atoms)', 'Proteins', 'Protein data', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
33211671,"Herein, we used C. acnes as a model to elucidate the antimicrobial machinery of the TH17 subset. We generated C. acnes-specific antimicrobial TH17 clones (AMTH17) with varying antimicrobial activity against C. acnes, to enable us to study mechanisms by which TH17 cells kill bacteria. We show that C. acnes-induced AMTH17 clones represent a subset of CD4+ TEM and TEMRA cells. RNA-seq analysis of AMTH17 indicate transcripts encoding antimicrobial molecules such as GNLY, GZMB, PRF1 and histone H2B, whose expression correlates with killing activity. Additionally, we validated that AMTH17-mediated killing is a general mechanism that can target C. acnes and other bacterial species. Scanning electron microscopy reveal that AMTH17s can release T cell extracellular traps composed of lysine and arginine-rich histones such as H2B and H4 that entangle C. acnes. This study identifies a functionally distinct subpopulation of TH17 cells with an ability to secrete antimicrobial proteins and form extracellular T cell traps to capture and kill bacteria.
Fifteen AMTH17 and five n-AMTH17 clones (control) generated from six healthy donors were stimulated with α-CD3/α-CD28 (BD) in T cell media.","TH17 cell subpopulations have been defined that contribute to inflammation and homeostasis, yet the characteristics of TH17 cells that contribute to host defense against infection are not clear. To elucidate the antimicrobial machinery of the TH17 subset, we studied the response to Cutibacterium acnes, a skin commensal that is resistant to IL-26, the only known TH17-secreted protein with direct antimicrobial activity. We generated C. acnes-specific antimicrobial TH17 clones (AMTH17) with varying antimicrobial activity against C. acnes, which we correlated by RNA sequencing to the expression of transcripts encoding proteins that contribute to antimicrobial activity. Additionally, we validated that AMTH17-mediated killing of C. acnes and bacterial pathogens was dependent on the secretion of granulysin, granzyme B, perforin, and histone H2B. We found that AMTH17 cells can release fibrous structures composed of DNA decorated with histone H2B that entangle C. acnes that we call T cell extracellular traps (TETs). Within acne lesions, H2B and IL-17 colocalized in CD4+ T cells, in proximity to TETs in the extracellular space composed of DNA decorated with H2B.

Two snoRNA classes, formerly distinguished by their structure and ribonucleoprotein composition, act as guide RNA to target RNA such as ribosomal RNA, and thereby introduce specific modifications. We have studied the 5'end processing of individually transcribed snoRNA in S. cerevisiae to define their role in snoRNA biogenesis and functionality. Here we show that pre-snoRNA processing by the endonuclease Rnt1 occurs co-transcriptionally with removal of the m<sup>7</sup>G cap facilitating the formation of box C/D snoRNA. Failure of this process causes aberrant 3'end processing and mislocalization of snoRNA to the cytoplasm. Consequently, Rnt1-dependent 5'end processing of box C/D snoRNA is critical for snoRNA-dependent methylation of ribosomal RNA.

28701729,Effect of RNA integrity on miRNA expression profiles by microarrays and Detection of miRNA signals in compromised RNA samples,"Although microRNAs are supposed to be stable in-vivo, degradation processes potentially blur our knowledge on the small oligonucleotides. We set to quantify the effect of degradation on microRNAs in mouse to identify causes for distorted microRNAs patterns. In liver, we found 298, 99 and 8 microRNAs whose expression significantly correlated to RNA integrity, storage time at room temperature and storage time at 4 °C, respectively. Expression levels of 226 microRNAs significantly differed between liver samples with high RNA integrity compared to liver samples with low RNA integrity by more than two-fold. Especially the 157 microRNAs with increased expression in tissue samples with low RNA integrity were most recently added to miRBase. Testing potentially confounding sources, e.g. in-vitro degraded RNA depleted of small RNAs, we detected signals for 350 microRNAs, suggesting cross-hybridization of fragmented RNAs. Therefore, we conclude that especially microRNAs added in the latest miRBase versions might be artefacts due to RNA degradation. The results facilitate differentiation between degradation-resilient microRNAs, degradation-sensitive microRNAs, and likely erroneously annotated microRNAs. The latter were largely identified by NGS but not experimentally validated and can severely bias microRNA biomarker research and impact the value of microRNAs as diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic tools.","['Animals', '*Computational Biology/methods', '*Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/isolation & purification/standards', '*Molecular Sequence Annotation/standards']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid structure data', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation track']"

Analysis of in-gradient distributions and subsequent tag-based protein capture identified interactions of the exoribonuclease Cbf1/YhaM with sRNAs that control bacterial competence for DNA uptake.

Our 3D structure of the eIF4A3/CWC22/CWC27 complex is compatible with the Bact spliceosome structure but not with that of the C complex, where a CWC27 loop would clash with the EJC core subunit Y14. A CWC27/CWC22 building block might thus form an intermediate landing platform for eIF4A3 onto the Bact complex prior to its conversion into C complex. Knock-down of either CWC27 or CWC22 in immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells affects numerous common genes, indicating that these proteins cooperate, targeting the same pathways. As the most up-regulated genes encode factors involved in inflammation, our findings suggest a possible link to the retinal degeneration associated with CWC27 deficiencies.","['Cell Line', 'Cyclophilins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes/*chemistry/metabolism']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Eukaryotes', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Unicellular eukaryotes', 'Exons', 'Exome sequencing', 'ASTD ID (exon)', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'R markdown', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Splice sites', 'Splice site prediction', 'Ribosomes']"

Although cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse event associated with several KIs, the reasons remain poorly understood and its prediction remains challenging. Here, we perform transcriptomic profiling of human heart-derived primary cardiomyocyte cell lines treated with a panel of 26 FDA-approved KIs and classify their effects on subcellular pathways and processes. Individual cardiotoxicity patient reports for these KIs, obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, are used to compute relative risk scores. These are then combined with cell line-derived transcriptomic datasets through elastic net regression analysis to identify a gene signature that can predict risk of cardiotoxicity. We also identify relationships between cardiotoxicity risk and structural/binding profiles of individual KIs. We conclude that acute transcriptomic changes in cell-based assays combined with drug substructures are predictive of KI-induced cardiotoxicity risk, and that they can be informative for future drug discovery.

We have serendipitously found that non-haematopoietic DNGR-1 lineage traced cells residing in the ependymal cell layer of the central nervous system display the two cardinal properties of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. However, whether these properties were a feature of all DNGR-1-traced cells or were confined to a particular subset of these is unclear. To address the potential heterogeneity of DNGR-1-traced ependymal cells and caractherise their putative stem cell compartment we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of DNGR-1-traced cells isolated from uninjured spinal cords.
DNGR-1 lineage traced cells pooled from a spinal cords dissected from DNGR-1 lineage tracer mice were FACS sorted and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing","Cells with latent stem ability can contribute to mammalian tissue regeneration after damage. Whether the central nervous system (CNS) harbors such cells remains controversial. Here, we report that DNGR-1 lineage tracing in mice identifies an ependymal cell subset, wherein resides latent regenerative potential. We demonstrate that DNGR-1-lineage-traced ependymal cells arise early in embryogenesis (E11.5) and subsequently spread across the lining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled compartments to form a contiguous sheet from the brain to the end of the spinal cord. In the steady state, these DNGR-1-traced cells are quiescent, committed to their ependymal cell fate, and do not contribute to neuronal or glial lineages. However, trans-differentiation can be induced in adult mice by CNS injury or in vitro by culture with suitable factors.

2-colour microarray desgin using 9 spotted oligonucleotide microarrays printed at the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre. Total RNA from Ecdysone treated KC167 cells were compared to Total RNA from an EtOH (the solvent for ecdysone) control sample pool.","During heat shock (HS) and other stresses, HS gene transcription in eukaryotes is up-regulated by the transcription factor heat shock factor (HSF). While the identities of the major HS genes have been known for more than 30 years, it has been suspected that HSF binds to numerous other genes and potentially regulates their transcription. In this study, we have used a chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) approach to identify 434 regions in the Drosophila genome that are bound by HSF. We have also performed a transcript analysis of heat shocked Kc167 cells and third instar larvae and compared them to HSF binding sites. The heat-induced transcription profiles were quite different between cells and larvae and surprisingly only about 10% of the genes associated with HSF binding sites show changed transcription. There were also genes that showed changes in transcript levels that did not appear to correlate with HSF binding sites. Analysis of the locations of the HSF binding sites revealed that 57% were contained within genes with approximately 2/3rds of these sites being in introns. We also found that the insulator protein, BEAF, has enriched binding prior to HS to promoters of genes that are bound by HSF upon HS but that are not transcriptionally induced during HS. When the genes associated with HSF binding sites in promoters were analyzed for gene ontology terms, categories such as stress response and transferase activity were enriched whereas analysis of genes having HSF binding sites in introns identified those categories plus ones related to developmental processes and reproduction. These results suggest that Drosophila HSF may be regulating many genes besides the known HS genes and that some of these genes may be regulated during non-stress conditions.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Drosophila Proteins/*chemistry', 'Drosophila melanogaster/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Insect', 'Genome', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Response/*genetics', 'Hot Temperature', 'Introns', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'Introns', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Protein interactions', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

We go on to show that Spen, recruited through the Xist A-repeat, plays a central role, being critical for silencing of all except a subset of weakly expressed genes. Polycomb, recruited through the Xist B/C-repeat, also plays a key role, favouring silencing of genes with pre-existing H3K27me3 chromatin.

Thus understanding mechanisms by which immunocompetent cells such as testicular macrophages (TM) respond to infection and how bacterial pathogens manipulate defense pathways is of great relevance.

UPEC-dependent NFAT activation was confirmed in cultured TM and in TM using an in vivo infection model. Elevated expression of NFATC2-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines was found in TM (IL-4, IL-13) and PM (IL-3, IL-4, IL-13). NFATC2 is activated by a rapid influx of calcium caused by the UPEC pore forming toxin alpha-hemolysin. Mutant analysis identified alpha-hemolysin as the main virulent factor responsible for UPEC-dependant suppression of IL-6 and TNF-a cytokine release from PM. Alpha-hemolysin caused differential activation of MAP kinase and AP-1 signaling pathways in TM and PM leading to differential expression profiles of key pro-inflammatory cytokines in PM (IL-1a, IL-1b and IL-6 downregulated) and TM (IL-1b and IL-6 upregulated).

In this study, we first profiled the expression of small RNAs in type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids by deep sequencing. We then focused on the computational analysis of the potential piRNAs generated in the present study as well as other published sets. piRNAs mapping to retrotransposons, mRNAs, and intergenic regions had different length distributions and were differentially regulated in spermatogenesis. piRNA-generating mRNAs (PRMRs), whose expression positively correlated with their piRNA products, constituted one-third of the protein-coding genes and were evolutionarily conserved and enriched with splicing isoforms and antisense transcripts. PRMRs with piRNAs preferentially mapped to CDSs and 3' UTRs partitioned into three clusters differentially expressed during spermatogenesis and enriched with unique sets of functional annotation terms related to housekeeping activities as well as spermatogenesis-specific processes. Intergenic piRNAs were divided into 2992 clusters probably representing novel transcriptional units that have not been reported. The transcripts of a large number of genes involved in spermatogenesis are the precursors of piRNAs, and these genes are intricately regulated by alternative splicing and antisense transcripts. piRNAs, whose regulatory role in gene expression awaits to be identified, are clearly products of a novel regulatory process that needs to be defined.","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spermatids/metabolism', 'Spermatocytes/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Spermatogonia/metabolism', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Lipids', 'Nucleic acids', 'Ensembl ID', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

21368835,"MSL (Male-specific lethal) complex increases transcription on the single X chromosome of Drosophila males in order to equalize expression of X-linked genes between males (XY) and females (XX). The increase in transcript levels correlates with MSL- dependent acetylation of histone H4 at K16 within the bodies of active genes, but identification of the transcriptional step affected has not been possible. In this study, we use global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to examine the specific effect of MSL complex on RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) on a genome-wide level. Results indicate that MSL complex enhances transcription by facilitating the progression of RNAP II across the bodies of active X-linked genes. Improving transcriptional output downstream of typical gene-specific control may explain how dosage compensation can be imposed on the diverse set of genes along an entire chromosome.
Global Run-On Sequencing (GRO-Seq) reads, i.e., RNA-Seq of nascent RNA transcripts, from D. Melanogaster SL2 cells.  Two biological replicates of cells treated with control GFP RNAi and cells treated with MSL2 RNAi were analyzed.","The evolution of sex chromosomes has resulted in numerous species in which females inherit two X chromosomes but males have a single X, thus requiring dosage compensation. MSL (Male-specific lethal) complex increases transcription on the single X chromosome of Drosophila males to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes. The biochemical mechanisms used for dosage compensation must function over a wide dynamic range of transcription levels and differential expression patterns. It has been proposed that the MSL complex regulates transcriptional elongation to control dosage compensation, a model subsequently supported by mapping of the MSL complex and MSL-dependent histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation to the bodies of X-linked genes in males, with a bias towards 3' ends. However, experimental analysis of MSL function at the mechanistic level has been challenging owing to the small magnitude of the chromosome-wide effect and the lack of an in vitro system for biochemical analysis. Here we use global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to examine the specific effect of the MSL complex on RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) on a genome-wide level.

20168330,"The consitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signalling cascade is reponsible for the majority of meyoproliferative disorders in humans, a disease that is also conserved in Drosophila. A gain-of-function mutation in the Drosophila JAK kinase leads to blood cell (haemocyte) overproliferation which eventually is manifested as black melanotic tumors. Haemocyte-like Drosophila Kc167 cells were used to identify downstream target genes of the JAK/STAT pathway which may be responsible for tumour generation and progression.
Kc167 cells were activated with the principal JAK/STAT pathway ligand Unpaired (UPD) in a time course manner. To this end, for each transcript profiling condition and time point, biological duplicates were activated with UPD or Mock conditioned media for 30 min, and total RNA was extracted 2, 4 or 10h after initial addition of conditioned media. 12 samples were used for hybridization to the arrays.","Although many signal transduction pathways have been implicated in the development of human disease, the identification of pathway targets and the biological processes that mediate disease progression remains challenging. One such disease-related pathway is the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade whose constitutive misactivation by the JAK2 V617F mutation underlies most human myeloproliferative disorders. Here, we use transcript profiling of Drosophila haemocyte-like cells to identify JAK/STAT target genes, combined with an in vivo model for JAK-induced blood cell overproliferation, to identify the main effectors required for haematopoietic tumour development. The identified human homologues of the Drosophila effectors were tested for potential V617F-mediated transcriptional regulation in human HeLa cells and compared with small interfering RNA-derived data, quantify their role in regulating the proliferation of cancer-derived cell lines.

However, DNA methylation profiles have not been compared on a large scale between prostate tumor and normal prostate, and the mechanisms behind these alterations are unknown. In this study, we quantitatively profiled 95 primary prostate tumors and 86 healthy prostate tissue samples for their DNA methylation levels at 26,333 CpGs representing 14,104 gene promoters by using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 platform. A 2-class Significance Analysis of this dataset revealed 5,912 CpG sites with increased DNA methylation and 2,151 CpG sites with decreased DNA methylation in tumors (FDR < 0.8%). Prediction Analysis of this dataset identified 87 CpGs that are the most predictive diagnostic methylation biomarkers of prostate cancer. By integrating available clinical follow-up data, we also identified 69 prognostic DNA methylation alterations that correlate with biochemical recurrence of the tumor. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors.

The goal of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism. Based on an initial interrogation of the transcriptomes of unstimulated and TNF-α and IFN-γ-stimulated primary lung fibroblasts and the lung fibroblast cell line, MRC5, we show here that among Fas-signaling pathway molecules, Fas expression was increased ~6-fold in an NF-κB and p38mapk-dependent fashion.  Prevention of the increase in Fas expression using Fas siRNAs blocked the ability of TNF-α and IFN-γ to sensitize fibroblasts to Fas ligation induced-apoptosis; while enforced adenovirus-mediated Fas overexpression was sufficient to overcome basal resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Examination of lung tissues from IPF patients revealed low to absent staining of Fas in fibroblastic cells of fibroblast foci. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased expression of Fas is necessary and sufficient to overcome the resistance of lung fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis. They also suggest that approaches aimed at increasing Fas expression by lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may be therapeutically relevant.

In this study, we examined the requirement for DGAT enzymes in TG synthesis and LDs in differentiated adipocytes with genetic deletions of DGAT1 and DGAT2. Adipocytes with a single deletion of either enzyme were capable of TG synthesis and LD formation. In contrast, adipocytes with deletions of both DGATs were severely lacking in TG and did not have LDs, indicating that DGAT1 and DGAT2 account for nearly all TG synthesis in adipocytes and appear to be required for LD formation during adipogenesis. DGAT enzymes were not absolutely required for LD formation in mammalian cells, however; macrophages deficient in both DGAT enzymes were able to form LDs when incubated with cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Although adipocytes lacking both DGATs had no TG or LDs, they were fully differentiated by multiple criteria.

20615957,"We tested and measured the strength of heterospecific interactions between microRNAs and their targets by carrying out transgenic experiments across Drosophila species, by over-expressing the miR310s cluster of D. melanogaster (Dm310s) and D. pseudoobscura (Dp310s) in D. melanogaster. A knockout line, referred to as Dm310s (−), was also included for comparison. The whole-genome expression (WGE) of the Dp310s and Dm310s transgenic lines were compared on two platforms of both Affymetrix tiling array and DGRC cDNA array. The WGE of knockout line was assayed on only Affymetrix tiling array. In the Dm310s lines, overexpression was more common than underexpression among misregulated genes while the pattern appeared to be reversed in the Dm310s(−) line. The number of genes significantly misexpressed under the influence of Dp310s is 3-10 times greater than under Dm310s.  Importantly, the numbers of predicted targets are similar between them.  Expression analysis of the predicted target genes suggests that miRNAs may sometimes function to buffer fluctuations in the transcriptome output.  After the buffering function has evolved, heterospecific combinations may cause adverse effects.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
The three data sets are all parts of the same overall study, in which we over-expressed the Dm310s and Dp310s in D. melanogaster, and analyzed the transcriptional consequences by using microarrays.

Under this assumption, miRNAs and targets from different species may interact adversely, resulting in reduced fitness. However, the strength of the adverse interactions may not be detectable because even outright deletions of miRNAs often manifest only subtle fitness effects.

Flies overexpressing the heterospecific Dp310s are only one-third as viable as those overexpressing the conspecific Dm310s. The viability effect is easily detectable in comparison to the effect of the deletion of miR310s. The number of genes significantly misexpressed under the influence of Dp310s is 3-10 times greater than under Dm310s. Importantly, the numbers of predicted targets are similar between them. Expression analysis of the predicted target genes suggests that miRNAs may sometimes function to buffer fluctuations in the transcriptome output. After the buffering function has evolved, heterospecific combinations may cause adverse effects.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Drosophila/*classification/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Insect/*genetics', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Genome/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Species Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transformation, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Protein modification ID', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic code', 'Genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Read mapping', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Phylogenetic tree format', 'Genetic mapping']"

Refer to individual Series","Microbial challenges, such as widespread bacterial infection in sepsis, induce endotoxin tolerance, a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequent infections. The participation of DNA methylation in this process is poorly known. In this study, we perform integrated analysis of DNA methylation and transcriptional changes following <i>in vitro</i> exposure to gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, together with analysis of <i>ex vivo</i> monocytes from septic patients. We identify TET2-mediated demethylation and transcriptional activation of inflammation-related genes that is specific to toll-like receptor stimulation. Changes also involve phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5, elements of the JAK2 pathway. JAK2 pathway inhibition impairs the activation of tolerized genes on the first encounter with lipopolysaccharide. We then confirm the implication of the JAK2-STAT pathway in the aberrant DNA methylome of patients with sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria. Finally, JAK2 inhibition in monocytes partially recapitulates the expression changes produced in the immunosuppressive cellular state acquired by monocytes from gram-negative sepsis, as described by single cell-RNA-sequencing. Our study evidences both the crucial role the JAK2-STAT pathway in epigenetic regulation and initial response of the tolerized genes to gram-negative bacterial endotoxins and provides a pharmacological target to prevent exacerbated responses.","['Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation/genetics/immunology', 'Endotoxin Tolerance/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'Endotoxins/toxicity', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/*immunology', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Male', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*microbiology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Sepsis/*genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/immunology']","['Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Toxin name', 'Toxin structure', 'Toxin accession', 'Toxins and targets', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Protein interactions', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'Kinase name', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'MAT', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Sequence analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
34551299,"DNA replication timing and 3D chromatin organisation are associated with epigenomic changes across large domains during human differentiation and cancer progression. However, it is unclear if epigenome changes, in particular cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation, is a consequence or cause of changes observed in higher order genome architecture. Here, we compare replication timing profiles and three dimensional (3D) genome organisation, using Hi-C and single cell Repli-Seq in the DNMT1 and DNMT3B DNA methyltransferases double knockout hypomethylated DKO1 colorectal cancer cell line and its parental HCT116 cell line. We find that the hypomethylated cells show a profound loss of replication timing precision, gain of single cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of chromatin conformation integrity. Discrete regions, that undergo a large change in replication timing in the hypomethylated cells, are associated with a loss of allelic replication timing and shrinking of late replicating Partially Methylated Domain (PMD) boundaries. In contrast, conservation of replication timing after DNA methylation depletion at PMDs is associated with the formation of new H3K9me3/H3K4me3 bivalent domains which may serve to prevent ectopic transcription and maintain cell viability. Together our results show that a loss of global methylation, a common hallmark of cancer, directly impacts on the precision of replication timing and contribute to deregulation of the 3D chromatin architecture.
Repli-Seq, single cell Repli-Seq, Hi-C, WGBS and Nanopore sequencing was conducted in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell line and the same cell line with knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B (DKO1) (Rhee et al. 2002).","DNA replication timing and three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are associated with distinct epigenome patterns across large domains. However, whether alterations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, affects higher-order levels of genome architecture is still unclear. Here, using Repli-Seq, single-cell Repli-Seq, and Hi-C, we show that genome-wide methylation loss is associated with both concordant loss of replication timing precision and deregulation of 3D genome organization. Notably, we find distinct disruption in 3D genome compartmentalization, striking gains in cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of allelic replication timing in cancer hypomethylation models, potentially through the gene deregulation of DNA replication and genome organization pathways. Finally, we identify ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains from across large hypomethylated domains, where late replication is maintained, which we purport serves to protect against catastrophic genome reorganization and aberrant gene transcription. Our results highlight a potential role for the methylome in the maintenance of 3D genome regulation.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Replication Timing/*physiology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', '*Genome, Human', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Database', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"

Refer to individual Series","The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which conveys epithelial (E) carcinoma cells to quasi-mesenchymal (qM) states, enables them to metastasize and acquire resistance to certain treatments. Murine tumors composed of qM mammary carcinoma cells assemble an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and develop resistance to anti-CTLA4 immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, unlike their E counterparts. Importantly, minority populations of qM cells within a tumor can cross-protect their more E neighbors from immune attack. The underlying mechanisms of immunosuppression and cross-protection have been unclear. We demonstrate that abrogation of qM carcinoma cell-derived factors (CD73, CSF1, or SPP1) prevents the assembly of an immunosuppressive TME and sensitizes otherwise refractory qM tumors partially or completely to anti-CTLA4 ICB. Most strikingly, mixed tumors in which minority populations of carcinoma cells no longer express CD73 are now sensitized to anti-CTLA4 ICB. Finally, loss of CD73 also enhances the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 ICB during the process of metastatic colonization. SIGNIFICANCE: Minority populations of qM carcinoma cells, which likely reside in human breast carcinomas, can cross-protect their E neighbors from immune attack. Understanding the mechanisms by which qM carcinoma cells resist antitumor immune attack can help identify signaling channels that can be interrupted to potentiate the efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995</i>.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Transition matrix', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Gene expression', 'Expression data', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Tumor annotation']"

C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups and fed a normal diet, high-fat diet, or high-fat + 0.05% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>) UR diet for 16 weeks. Oligonucleotide microarray profiling revealed that UR is an effective regulator of the liver transcriptome, and canonical pathways associated with the ""circadian rhythm"" and ""extracellular matrix (ECM)⁻receptor interactions"" were effectively regulated by UR in the liver. UR altered the expression of various clock and clock-controlled genes (CCGs), which may be linked to the improvement of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis via lipid metabolism control and detoxification enhancement. UR reduced excessive reactive oxygen species production, adipokine/cytokine dysregulation, and ECM accumulation in the liver, which also contributed to improve hepatic lipotoxicity and fibrosis. Moreover, UR improved pancreatic islet dysfunction, and suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby reducing obesity-associated insulin resistance. Therapeutic approaches targeting hepatic circadian clock and CCGs using UR may ameliorate the deleterious effects of diet-induced obesity and associated complications such as hepatic fibrosis.","['Adipokines/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Circadian Clocks', 'Circadian Rhythm/*drug effects', 'Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects', 'Fatty Liver/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Gluconeogenesis/drug effects', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Islets of Langerhans/drug effects', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Fate map', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Histogram', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Plant biology', 'Data retrieval', 'Feature extraction', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation']"

To reveal its druggable vulnerabilities, we perform kinase-focused RNAi screens and uncover that SMARCA4-deficient SCCOHT cells are highly sensitive to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). SMARCA4 loss causes profound downregulation of cyclin D1, which limits CDK4/6 kinase activity in SCCOHT cells and leads to in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibitors. SCCOHT patient tumors are deficient in cyclin D1 yet retain the retinoblastoma-proficient/p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-deficient profile associated with positive responses to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Thus, our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors, approved for a breast cancer subtype addicted to CDK4/6 activation, could be repurposed to treat SCCOHT. Moreover, our study suggests a novel paradigm whereby critically low oncogene levels, caused by loss of a driver tumor suppressor, may also be exploited therapeutically.","['Aminopyridines/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin D1/*deficiency/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Helical net', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'Workflows', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Kinase name', 'pure', 'pure protein', 'pure rna', 'Python script', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"

We inferred phylogenetic placement of Endogonaceae and estimated the ages of Endogonaceae and Endogonales with expanded taxon sampling. Endogonaceae have large genomes with high repeat content, low diversity of PCWDEs, but without elevated SSP/secretome ratios.

Conditional ablation of PU.1 de-repressed the pDC transcriptional signature in cDCs. The combination of genome-wide mapping of PU.1 binding and gene expression analysis revealed a key role for PU.1 in maintaining cDC identity through the induction of the transcriptional regulator DC-SCRIPT.

Refer to individual Series","The tRNA pool determines the efficiency, throughput, and accuracy of translation. Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA (transfer RNA) supply and mRNA (messenger RNA) demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet dynamic changes may also occur during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less well characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering their antigen receptor. We observed a global signature of switch in demand for codons at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation, the response of the tRNA pool relaxed back to the basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, wybutosine and ms<sup>2</sup>t6A, are reduced dramatically during T cell activation. These modifications occur in the anticodon loops of two tRNAs that decode ""slippery codons,"" which are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase the potential for proteome-wide frameshifting during T cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with an HIV gag-pol frameshifting site reporter.

Single cell profiles were derived from the dorsal skin of young control, young YAP/TAZ knockout and old wild-type mice","Ageing is intimately connected to the induction of cell senescence<sup>1,2</sup>, but why this is so remains poorly understood. A key challenge is the identification of pathways that normally suppress senescence, are lost during ageing and are functionally relevant to oppose ageing<sup>3</sup>. Here we connected the structural and functional decline of ageing tissues to attenuated function of the master effectors of cellular mechanosignalling YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ activity declines during physiological ageing in stromal cells, and mimicking such decline through genetic inactivation of YAP/TAZ in these cells leads to accelerated ageing. Conversely, sustaining YAP function rejuvenates old cells and opposes the emergence of ageing-related traits associated with either physiological ageing or accelerated ageing triggered by a mechano-defective extracellular matrix. Ageing traits induced by inactivation of YAP/TAZ are preceded by induction of tissue senescence. This occurs because YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction suppresses cGAS-STING signalling, to the extent that inhibition of STING prevents tissue senescence and premature ageing-related tissue degeneration after YAP/TAZ inactivation. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ-mediated control of cGAS-STING signalling relies on the unexpected role of YAP/TAZ in preserving nuclear envelope integrity, at least in part through direct transcriptional regulation of lamin B1 and ACTR2, the latter of which is involved in building the peri-nuclear actin cap. The findings demonstrate that declining YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction drives ageing by unleashing cGAS-STING signalling, a pillar of innate immunity. Thus, sustaining YAP/TAZ mechanosignalling or inhibiting STING may represent promising approaches for limiting senescence-associated inflammation and improving healthy ageing.","['Actin-Related Protein 2/metabolism', '*Aging/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Healthy Aging', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lamin Type B/metabolism', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular/genetics', '*Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', '*Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stromal Cells/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*YAP-Signaling Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']","['protein', 'Protein report', 'Protein data', 'Imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Medical imaging', 'Sequence', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Gene expression matrix', 'Biomedical science', 'Medical informatics', 'Paediatrics', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'DNA transduction map', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'pure nucleotide', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Proteins', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein signature']"

Our cohort consists of scRNA-seq data from treatment-naïve and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (post-NACT) pairs from 11 homogeneously treated HGSOC patients. After quality control, we obtained 51,786 cells, including 8,806 malignant epithelial (tumor), 8,045 stromal and 34,935 immune cells.

To characterize chemotherapy resistance processes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, we prospectively collected tissue samples before and after chemotherapy and analyzed their transcriptomic profiles at a single-cell resolution. After removing patient-specific signals by a novel analysis approach, PRIMUS, we found a consistent increase in stress-associated cell state during chemotherapy, which was validated by RNA in situ hybridization and bulk RNA sequencing. The stress-associated state exists before chemotherapy, is subclonally enriched during the treatment, and associates with poor progression-free survival. Co-occurrence with an inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblast subtype in tumors implies that chemotherapy is associated with stress response in both cancer cells and stroma, driving a paracrine feed-forward loop. In summary, we have found a resistant state that integrates stromal signaling and subclonal evolution and offers targets to overcome chemotherapy resistance.","['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Exome Sequencing']","['Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Exome sequencing', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Ability to preserve and maintain the in vivo gene expression status ex vivo is essential for gene expression profiling and biomarker discovery from clinical sample material.  We  compared transcriptional profiles obtained from samples collected using two established peripheral blood RNA collection systems, TEMPUS™ and PAXgene™. We demonstrated that TEMPUS™ and PAXgene™ systems can be used in combination with RiboAmp® mRNA amplification without a need for a separate globin reduction step. However, use of samples collected through different blood collection methods in the same experiment should be avoided.
Two PAXgene and two TEMPUS blood RNA tubes were collected from three healthy volunteers (2 female and 1 male), in addition, pooled total RNA from PBMC of 41 normal blood donors was analyzed.","Peripheral whole blood is relatively easily obtained for monitoring gene expression for biomarker discovery using transcriptomic platforms such as genome-wide microarrays. However, whole blood provides challenges caused by sensitivity for ex vivo incubation and overrepresentation of globin mRNAs. We compared the performance of 2 commercial whole blood preservation methods, TEMPUS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and PAXgene (PreAnalytiX, Qiagen BD, Valencia, CA), using 2 RNA amplification protocols and high-density microarrays. Performance of commercial globin mRNA reduction protocol also was studied.

Affymetrix globin reduction protocol was applied for total RNA samples. Samples amplified with RiboAmp were hybridized on Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) and subjected to statistical analyses. RiboAmp mRNA amplification did not notably amplify globin mRNA that is overrepresented in RNA isolated by both TEMPUS and PAXgene preservation. Enzymatic depletion of globin transcript reduced the quality of total RNA and is thus not recommendable. Microarray analysis showed acceptable correlation within and between the RNA preservation methods, but altogether 443 transcripts were differentially expressed between RNA samples preserved in TEMPUS and PAXgene tubes. We demonstrated that the 2 tested blood RNA-preservation methods combined with RiboAmp mRNA amplification may be used for microarray experiments without the need for a prior globin RNA reduction. However, because genes involved in immune cell functions and gene regulatory pathways were differentially expressed as a result of the technical bias between the preservation methods, they should not be used in the same analytic setting.","['Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Preservation/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome, Human', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'RNA/*blood/*genetics', 'RNA Stability/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Translational Research, Biomedical']","['Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Sequence alignment analysis (conservation)', 'Sequence alignment report (site conservation)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Global alignment', 'Proteins', 'Protein globularity', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acid classification', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Medicine', 'Translational medicine', 'DNA translation']"

We combined laser-assisted microdissection (LAM), linear amplification starting from <1 ng of total RNA, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). As a model we used the central cell of the Arabidopsis thaliana female gametophyte, one of the female gametes harbored in the reproductive organs of the flower. We estimated the number of expressed genes to be more than twice the number reported previously in a study using LAM and ATH1 microarrays, and identified several classes of genes that were systematically underrepresented in the transcriptome measured with the ATH1 microarray. Among them are many genes that are likely to be important for developmental processes and specific cellular functions. In addition, we identified several intergenic regions, which are likely to be transcribed, and describe a considerable fraction of reads mapping to introns and regions flanking annotated loci, which may represent alternative transcript isoforms.

16731695,"The maize spikelet contains two florets, each of which contains three anthers.  Morphologically, the anthers in the upper and lower florets proceed through the same developmental program. To test for global differences in gene expression between these anthers and to identify genes that are coordinately regulated during development, RNA isolated from upper and lower floret anthers at six developmental stages was used to hybridize cDNA microarrays.  Approximately 9% of the tested genes exhibited statistically significant differences in gene expression between anthers in the upper and lower florets.  This suggests that several basic biological processes are differentially regulated between upper and lower floret anthers, including photosynthesis, translation, and metabolism.  To identify genes that are coordinately regulated during anther development, cluster analyses were performed.  A variety of patterns of gene expression were observed.  Five genes involved in programmed cell death were up-regulated at the time the tapetum begins to degenerate (i.e., the early microspore stage).  This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that tapetal degeneration occurs via programmed cell death.  In addition, many genes involved in protein synthesis exhibited differential expression patterns during anther development. Each microarray slide was scanned multiple times.  This approach led to the identification an additional 30 to 40% of statistically significant differences in gene expression as compared to a single-scan strategy.Keywords: time course

To determine how metazoan DNA replication can be repressed, we examined regions selectively under-replicated in Drosophila polytene salivary glands, and found they are transcriptionally silent and enriched for the repressive H3K27me3 mark. In the first genome-wide analysis of binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in a differentiated metazoan tissue, we find that ORC binding is dramatically reduced within these large domains, suggesting reduced initiation as one mechanism leading to under-replication. Inhibition of replication fork progression by the chromatin protein SUUR is an additional repression mechanism to reduce copy number. Although repressive histone marks are removed when SUUR is mutated and copy number restored, neither transcription nor ORC binding is reinstated. Tethering of the SUUR protein to a specific site is insufficient to block replication, however.

Computed","We studied the physiological response to glucose limitation in batch and steady-state (chemostat) cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by following global patterns of gene expression. Glucose-limited batch cultures of yeast go through two sequential exponential growth phases, beginning with a largely fermentative phase, followed by an essentially completely aerobic use of residual glucose and evolved ethanol. Judging from the patterns of gene expression, the state of the cells growing at steady state in glucose-limited chemostats corresponds most closely with the state of cells in batch cultures just before they undergo this ""diauxic shift."" Essentially the same pattern was found between chemostats having a fivefold difference in steady-state growth rate (the lower rate approximating that of the second phase respiratory growth rate in batch cultures). Although in both cases the cells in the chemostat consumed most of the glucose, in neither case did they seem to be metabolizing it primarily through respiration. Although there was some indication of a modest oxidative stress response, the chemostat cultures did not exhibit the massive environmental stress response associated with starvation that also is observed, at least in part, during the diauxic shift in batch cultures. We conclude that despite the theoretical possibility of a switch to fully aerobic metabolism of glucose in the chemostat under conditions of glucose scarcity, homeostatic mechanisms are able to carry out metabolic adjustment as if fermentation of the glucose is the preferred option until the glucose is entirely depleted. These results suggest that some aspect of actual starvation, possibly a component of the stress response, may be required for triggering the metabolic remodeling associated with the diauxic shift.","['Aerobiosis', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Ethanol/metabolism', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Homeostasis', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/biosynthesis']","['Microbiology', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Documentation and help', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Fungi', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'Analysis', 'Epistasis', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Kinetic model', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Chromosomes', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession']"

There are also considerable safety concerns for hPSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth. Here we present a novel floor plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor plate precursors are derived from hPSCs in days following exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signaling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive in vitro molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of hPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in PD animal models in three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-OHDA-lesioned mouse and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behavior and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into Parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models tested indicate considerable promise for the development of cell based therapies in PD.

We measured mRNA abundance and protein production through yeast sporulation and found strong temporal control for most genes, achieved through both mRNA levels and translational regulation. Monitoring the timing of protein production revealed novel factors involved in recombination and helped to illuminate the molecular basis of the broad restructuring of meiotic cells. We also found a strong increase in noncanonical translation at short open reading frames (sORFs) on unannnotated transcripts and upstream regions of known transcripts (uORFs). Ribosome occupancy at near-cognate uORFs was associated with more efficient ORF translation; while some AUG uORFs, often on regulated leader extensions, acted comptetitively. This work reveals a pervasive role for meiotic translational control and great complexity in genomic coding.

22388088,"The first bona fide PTP proto-oncogene was the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by PTPN11), an ubiquitously expressed PTP that transduces mitogenic, pro-survival, cell fate and/or pro-migratory signals from numerous growth factor-, cytokine- and extracellular matrix receptors. In malignancies, SHP2 is hyperactivated either downstream of oncoproteins or by mutations.We provide analysis of a primary triple-negative breast tumor grown as xenografts in the presence or absence of SHP2 for 30 days.
A primary triple-negative breast tumor (BT8) was transduced with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector expressing a CTRL miR or SHP2 miR1 or SHP2 miR2. Cells from each group were injected in imuunodeficient mice and after tumor development, the knockdown of SHP2 was induced for 30 days in vivo. At day 30, tumors were dissected and RNA isolated for gene expression analysis.","New cancer therapies are likely to arise from an in-depth understanding of the signaling networks influencing tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. We show a fundamental role for Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) in these processes in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockdown of SHP2 eradicated breast tumor-initiating cells in xenograft models, and SHP2 depletion also prevented invasion in three-dimensional cultures and in a transductal invasion assay in vivo. Notably, SHP2 knockdown in established breast tumors blocked their growth and reduced metastasis. Mechanistically, SHP2 activated stemness-associated transcription factors, including v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which resulted in the repression of let-7 microRNA and the expression of a set of 'SHP2 signature' genes. We found these genes to be simultaneously activated in a large subset of human primary breast tumors that are associated with invasive behavior and poor prognosis. These results provide new insights into the signaling cascades influencing tumor-initiating cells as well as a rationale for targeting SHP2 in breast cancer.","['Animals', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Computational Biology', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1', 'src Homology Domains/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'JASPAR format', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Sequence similarity', 'Protein globularity', 'Molecular similarity score', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Cytometry', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'GEN', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein alignment', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Molecule name', 'Molecule report', 'Type', 'Protein signature type', 'Map type', 'Protein data', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Cell culture collection', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zinc finger prediction', 'Gene finding', 'Gene prediction', 'Gene family report', 'Homology modelling']"

Less is known about possible functions of RNAi in the nucleus. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, RNAi is crucial to establish and maintain centromeric heterochromatin and functions to repress genome activity by a chromatin silencing mechanism referred to as cotranscriptional gene silencing (CTGS). Mechanistic details and the physiological relevance of CTGS are unknown. Here we show that RNAi components interact with chromatin at nuclear pores to keep stress response genes in check. We demonstrate that RNAi-mediated CTGS represses stress-inducible genes by degrading mRNAs under noninduced conditions. Under chronic heat stress conditions, a Dicer thermoswitch deports Dicer to the cytoplasm, thereby disrupting CTGS and enabling expression of genes implicated in the acquisition of thermotolerance. Taken together, our work highlights a role for nuclear pores and the stress response transcription factor Atf1 in coordinating the interplay between the RNAi machinery and the S. pombe genome and uncovers a novel mode of RNAi regulation in response to an environmental cue.","['Activating Transcription Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoribonucleases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Pore/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', '*RNA Interference', 'Schizosaccharomyces/genetics/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Stress, Physiological']","['Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Nucleic acid structure report', 'Nucleic acid structure', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Proteins', 'Lipoproteins', 'Promoter ID', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Protein report', 'Protein report format', 'protein', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"

ChIP-seq for Pol II in various Drosophila embryos","Paused RNA polymerase (Pol II) is a pervasive feature of Drosophila embryos and mammalian stem cells, but its role in development is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that a spectrum of paused Pol II determines the ""time to synchrony""-the time required to achieve coordinated gene expression across the cells of a tissue. To determine whether synchronous patterns of gene activation are significant in development, we manipulated the timing of snail expression, which controls the coordinated invagination of ∼1,000 mesoderm cells during gastrulation. Replacement of the strongly paused snail promoter with moderately paused or nonpaused promoters causes stochastic activation of snail expression and increased variability of mesoderm invagination. Computational modeling of the dorsal-ventral patterning network recapitulates these variable and bistable gastrulation profiles and emphasizes the importance of timing of gene activation in development. We conclude that paused Pol II and transcriptional synchrony are essential for coordinating cell behavior during morphogenesis.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*embryology/enzymology/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/*metabolism', 'Gastrulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'Calculation', 'Simulation', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Morphology parameter', 'NeuroMorpho ID', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
22751462,"Using data from high-density genomic profiling arrays, we describe the profiles of somatic copy-number aberrations (SCNAs) in 486 adenocarcinomas across all three major digestive organs, including 296 gastric and esophageal cancers. This analysis revealed that although patterns of broad, chromosome arm-level alterations are similar across the three types of adenocarcinoma, focal genomic amplifications are substantially more prevalent in gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma. A statistical analysis identified 64 regions of significantly recurrent amplification and deletion, including those shared across these tumors and those uniquely significant in adenocarcinomas from a single organ.  Among significantly amplified genes are those encoding therapeutically targetable kinases such as ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, EGFR, and MET, events noted in 14% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and 37% of gastric/esophageal tumors suggesting that analysis of genomic amplification will be a critical source of biomarkers to guide therapies in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.  While many of the other significant loci of amplifications implicate genes recognized to play roles in gastrointestinal and other cancers, other loci point to regions that may harbor novel genes contributing to these cancers.  One such event is a recurrent focal deletion present in 15% of esophageal adenocarcinomas, which we narrow to a single likely target, the Runt transcription factor subunit RUNX1. Indeed, reintroduction of RUNX1 into a cell model with this deletion inhibited anchorage-independent growth. Overall, these results demonstrate genomic features common to these tumors and identify key differences that reflect distinctive biology and potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from 87 cancer DNAs derived from primary tumor tissues, as well as from DNA obtained from 1,480 normal DNA samples.Signal intensities were normalized to raw copy number estimates using the tangent normalization method, as described in Beroukhim et al., In Press and Mermel et al., In preparation. The 250K Sty data from this submission were combined with data for 128 colon adenocarcinomas (Firestein et al, Nature 2008) and segmented using GLAD. These segmented data were then combined with segmented SNP 6.0 data for 62 colon, 97 gastric and 112 esophageal adenocarcinomas using common markers to anchor the segments.  Data analysis across samples was performed using this GISTIC 2.0 algorithm (Mermel C et al, Genome Biology 2011).","A more detailed understanding of the somatic genetic events that drive gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas is necessary to improve diagnosis and therapy.

21629720,Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis SB3432 genome sequencing,"Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the upper airways caused by the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, but its diagnosis remains difficult. As a consequence, and despite available antibiotherapy, some patients evolve advanced stages that can lead to disfiguration, severe respiratory impairment and death by anoxia. Because identification of the etiologic agent is crucial for the definitive diagnosis of the disease, the aim of this study was to develop two simple PCR assays. We took advantage of the fact that all Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis isolates are (i) of capsular serotype K3; and (ii) belong to a single clone with diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The complete sequence of the genomic region comprising the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) gene cluster was determined. Putative functions of the 21 genes identified were consistent with the structure of the K3 antigen.

B lymphoid-specific Kap1 knockout mice displayed reduced numbers of mature B cells, lower steady-state levels of antibodies and accelerated rates of decay of neutralizing antibodies following viral immunization. Transcriptome analyses of Kap1-deleted B splenocytes revealed an upregulation of PTEN, the enzymatic counter-actor of PIK3 signaling, and of genes encoding DNA damage response factors, cell-cycle regulators and chemokine receptors. ChIP/seq studies established that KAP1 bound at or close to a number of these genes, and controlled chromatin status at their promoters. Genome-wide, KAP1-binding sites avoided active B cell-specific enhancers and were enriched in repressive histone marks, further supporting a role for this molecule in gene silencing in vivo. Likely responsible for tethering KAP1 to at least some of these targets, a discrete subset of KRAB-ZFPs is enriched in B lymphocytes.

A unigene set was assembled and annotated, and differential digital gene expression was assessed from the different time-point and genotype representations of the reads within assembled contigs. As a complementary approach, we conducted microarray-based hybridization profiling using the cotton Affymetrix gene chip and labeled cDNAs from fibers at 11 dpa and for the same two genotypes and compared differentially expressed genes identified by the two platforms. The 454 unigenes were also mined for the presence of microsatellite repeats and SNPs that will be useful markers for mapping and marker-assisted selection in cotton improvement.-Total RNA was extracted from 11 dpa-old fibers from the two genotypes, Guazuncho 2 (Gossypium hirsutum) and VH8-4602 (G. barbadense), and included two replicates of each. RNA was checked for quality and quantity using an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, http://www.home.agilent.com) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The RNA was sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd.

The two major cultivated species, G. hirsutum (Gh) and G. barbadense (Gb), are allotetraploids with contrasting fiber quality properties. To better understand the molecular basis for their fiber differences, EST pyrosequencing was used to document the fiber transcriptomes at two key development stages, 10 days post anthesis (dpa), representing the peak of fiber elongation, and 22 dpa, representing the transition to secondary cell wall synthesis. The 617,000 high quality reads (89% of the total 692,000 reads) from 4 libraries were assembled into 46,072 unigenes, comprising 38,297 contigs and 7,775 singletons. Functional annotation of the unigenes together with comparative digital gene expression (DGE) revealed a diverse set of functions and processes that were partly linked to specific fiber stages. Globally, 2,770 contigs (7%) showed differential expression (>2-fold) between 10 and 22 dpa (irrespective of genotype), with 70% more highly expressed at 10 dpa, while 2,248 (6%) were differentially expressed between the genotypes (irrespective of stage). The most significant genes with differential DGE at 10 dpa included expansins and lipid transfer proteins (higher in Gb), while at 22 dpa tubulins, cellulose, and sucrose synthases showed higher expression in Gb. DGE was compared with expression data of 10 dpa-old fibers from Affymetrix microarrays. Among 543 contigs showing differential expression on both platforms, 74% were consistent in being either over-expressed in Gh (242 genes) or in Gb (161 genes). Furthermore, the unigene set served to identify 339 new SSRs and close to 21,000 inter-genotypic SNPs. Subsets of 88 SSRs and 48 SNPs were validated through mapping and added 65 new loci to a RIL genetic map.

Refer to individual Series","Methylation of H3K79 is associated with chromatin at expressed genes, though it is unclear if this histone modification is required for transcription of all genes. Recent studies suggest that Wnt-responsive genes depend particularly on H3K79 methylation, which is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DOT1L. Human leukemias carrying MLL gene rearrangements show DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation and aberrant expression of leukemogenic genes. DOT1L inhibitors reverse these effects, but their clinical use is potentially limited by toxicity in Wnt-dependent tissues such as intestinal epithelium. Genome-wide positioning of the H3K79me2 mark in Lgr5(+) mouse intestinal stem cells and mature intestinal villus epithelium correlated with expression levels of all transcripts and not with Wnt-responsive genes per se. Selective Dot1l disruption in Lgr5(+) stem cells or in whole intestinal epithelium eliminated H3K79me2 from the respective compartments, allowing genetic evaluation of DOT1L requirements. The absence of methylated H3K79 did not impair health, intestinal homeostasis, or expression of Wnt target genes in crypt epithelium for up to 4 months, despite increased crypt cell apoptosis. Global transcript profiles in Dot1l-null cells were barely altered. Thus, H3K79 methylation is not essential for transcription of Wnt-responsive or other intestinal genes, and intestinal toxicity is not imperative when DOT1L is rendered inactive in vivo.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Enterocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Histogram', ""Ensembl ID ('Ciona intestinalis')"", 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Keyword', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping']"

We generated gene expression data from 4 tumor tissues from a mouse Ctnnb1 knockout model (Ctnnb1 flox(ex3)/+) and 4 normal liver tissues from control wild-type mice.","Aberrant β-catenin activation contributes to a third or more of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but β-catenin activation alone is not sufficient to induce liver cancer in mice. Differentiated hepatocytes proliferate upon acute activation of either β-catenin or the nuclear xenobiotic receptor CAR. These responses are strictly limited and are tightly linked, since β-catenin is activated in nearly all of the CAR-dependent tumours generated by the tumour promoter phenobarbital. Here, we show that full activation of β-catenin in the liver induces senescence and growth arrest, which is overcome by combined CAR activation, resulting in uncontrolled hepatocyte proliferation, hepatomegaly and rapid lethality despite maintenance of normal liver function. Combining CAR activation with limited β-catenin activation induces tumorigenesis, and the tumours share a conserved gene expression signature with β-catenin-positive human HCC. These results reveal an unexpected route for hepatocyte proliferation and define a murine model of hepatocarcinogenesis with direct relevance to human HCC.","['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Liver/*growth & development/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'QSAR descriptor (constitutional)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Tumor annotation', 'Beta diversity data']"

First, we used traditional wax stripping to synchronize growth cycles in all dorsal pelage hair follicles.

By studying regeneration of hair follicles in response to patterned hair plucking, we demonstrate that organ-level quorum sensing allows coordinated responses to skin injury. Plucking hair at different densities leads to a regeneration of up to five times more neighboring, unplucked resting hairs, indicating activation of a collective decision-making process. Through data modeling, the range of the quorum signal was estimated to be on the order of 1 mm, greater than expected for a diffusible molecular cue. Molecular and genetic analysis uncovered a two-step mechanism, where release of CCL2 from injured hairs leads to recruitment of TNF-α-secreting macrophages, which accumulate and signal to both plucked and unplucked follicles. By coupling immune response with regeneration, this mechanism allows skin to respond predictively to distress, disregarding mild injury, while meeting stronger injury with full-scale cooperative activation of stem cells.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Hair Follicle/*cytology/physiology', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Regeneration', 'Skin/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell line report', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Article format', 'pair', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence masking', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Tumor annotation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

The purpose of this study was thus to determine the consequences of a single injection of METH (10) mg/kg) on the biochemical and transcriptional effects of a second challenge injection of the drug (2.5 mg/kg) given one month later. Towards that end, we measured monoamine levels and gene expression by microarray and quantitative PCR analyses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of 4 groups of rats: saline-pretreated and saline-challenged (SS); saline-pretreated and METH-challenged (SM); METH-pretreated and saline-challenged (MS); and METH-pretreated and METH-challenged (MM). The rats were euthanized 2 hours after the acute challenge injection and NAc samples were harvested. The acute METH challenge caused increases in NAc DA and HVA levels in both the SM and MM groups. Microarray analyses revealed that an injection of METH (2.5 mg/kg) produced acute changes (1.8-fold; p < 0.01) in the expression of 418 (358 up-, 60 downregulated) genes including several immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Arc, c-fos, and fosB in the SM group. Several neuropeptides including Cart, Crf (Crh), and vasopressin were upregulated in that group.  Injection of the higher dose of METH (10 mg/kg) did not influence monoamine levels but caused changes in 510 (345 up-, 165 downregulated) transcripts measured one month later (MS group). This list included Cart and Crf but not any IEGs. The MM group showed changes in 774 (572 up-, 202 downregulated) genes that also included vasopressin, Cart, and Crf whose expression was enhanced by the second METH injection.  Quantitative PCR confirmed the METH-induced changes in the expression of the neuropeptides. We also confirmed the METH-induced potentiation of Crf expression in the METH-pretreated group.  These observations suggest that a single injection of a moderate dose of METH can produce long-lasting changes in gene expression in the rodent NAc. The long-term increases in Crf expression also suggest that a single injection of a moderate METH dose can cause prolonged dysregulation in the endogenous stress system in the rat brain.
24 samples.  SS (4), SM (6), MS (7), MM (7)","Methamphetamine (METH) addiction is a biopsychosocial disorder that is accompanied by multiple relapses even after prolonged abstinence, suggesting the possibilities of long-lasting maladaptive epigenetic changes in the brain. Here, we show that METH administration produced time-dependent increases in the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh/Crf), arginine vasopressin (Avp), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide (Cartpt) mRNAs in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that METH increased the abundance of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) at the promoter of Cartpt but not at Avp or Crh DNA sequences. In contrast, METH produced DNA hypomethylation at sites near the Crh transcription start site (TSS) and at intragenic Avp sequences. METH also increased DNA hydroxymethylation at the Crh TSS and at intragenic Avp sites. In addition, METH increased the protein expression of ten-eleven-translocation enzymes that catalyze DNA hydroxymethylation. Importantly, METH increased TET1 binding at the Crh promoter and increased TET3 binding at Avp intragenic regions. We further tested the role of TET enzymes in METH-induced changes in gene expression by using the TET inhibitor, 1,5-isoquinolinediol (IQD), and found that IQD blocked METH-induced increases in Crh and Avp mRNA expression. Together, these results indicate that METH produced changes in neuropeptide transcription by both activation of the cAMP/CREB pathway and stimulation of TET-dependent DNA hydroxymethylation. These results provide molecular evidence for epigenetic controls of METH-induced changes in the expression of neuropeptides.","['Animals', 'Arginine Vasopressin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Methamphetamine/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleus Accumbens/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'DNA methylation', 'DNA translation', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'MAT', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Sequence accession (nucleic acid)', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Mice or rats']"

To address the role of clonal evolution in relapsed NPM1 mutated (NPM1mut) AML, we applied high-resolution genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling to detect copy number alterations (CNA) and uniparental disomies (UPD) and performed comprehensive gene mutation screening in 53 paired bone marrow/peripheral blood samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse. At diagnosis, 15 aberrations (CNAs, n=10; UPDs, n=5) were identified in 13 patients (25%), whereas at relapse 56 genomic alterations (CNAs, n=46; UPDs, n=10) were detected in 29 patients (55%) indicating an increase in genomic complexity. Recurrent aberrations acquired at relapse included deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes [ETV6 (n=3), TP53 (n=2), NF1 (n=2), WT1 (n=3), FHIT (n=2)] and homozygous FLT3 mutations acquired via UPD13q (n=7). DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3Amut) showed the highest stability (97%). Persistence of DNMT3Amut in 5 patients who lost NPM1mut at relapse suggests that DNMT3Amut may precede NPM1mut in AML pathogenesis. Of note, all relapse samples shared at least one genetic aberration with the matched primary AML sample implying common ancestral clones. In conclusion, our study reveals novel insights into clonal evolution in NPM1mut AML.
Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from diagnosis, remission and relapse of 53 NPM1 mutated AML patient were analyzed on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array.

Here, we report that IGF2BP3 promoted the invasiveness and metastasis of pancreatic cancers through locally translated IGF2BP3-bound transcripts.

We show evidence that IGF2BP3 and IGF2BP3-bound transcripts are localized in cytoplasmic RNA granules that accumulate in membrane protrusions of pancreatic cancer cells. Specific IGF2BP3-bound transcripts-ARF6 and ARHGEF4-that are preferentially translated in membrane protrusions induce further formation of membrane protrusions; consequently, IGF2BP3 promotes cell invasiveness and tumor metastasis.

In this study, we examined the genome-wide mRNA expression spectrum of UTUC aiming to characterize the molecular basis of this cancer, and identify potential prognostic markers and thus facilitate the clinical practices.Experimental Design: we compared the whole mRNA expression spectrum of cancer and matched normal tissues in 10 patients with UTUC using massively parallel sequencing, thereafter the protein levels and prognostic roles of ALDH2, CCNE1 and SMAD3 were evaluated under an independent validation set comprising of 104 patients.Results: mRNA down-regulation of ALDH2 and up-regulation of SMAD3 and CCNE1 in UTUC were revealed by expression profiling. And low protein expression of ALDH2 was associated with an adverse outcome for patients (p < 0.0001). Whereas high CCNE1 and SMAD3 were associated with adverse clinical outcome (p < 0.0001). And multivariate analysis revealed that all these three molecular markers were independent prognostic predictors. Besides, compared to the pathological TNM classification, All ALDH2, CCNE1 and SMAD3 were more competent in identifying patient subgroup with high mortality risk, and the molecular markers were able to predict the survival difference in the patients of T2 and T3 subgroup (p < 0.001), which could not be achieved by TNM staging.Conclusions: This is the ﬁrst prospective study that characterizes genome-wide mRNA expression profile of UTUC.

Enzymatic dissociation, a cornerstone of large-scale hPSC culture systems, has been reported to be deleterious, but the extent and the timeline of the genomic alterations induced by this passaging technique are still unclear. We prospectively monitored three hESC lines that were initially derived and cultured on human feeders and passaged mechanically before switching to enzymatic single-cell passaging. We show that karyotype abnormalities and copy number variations are not restricted to long-term culture, but can occur very rapidly, within five passages after switching hESCs to enzymatic dissociation. Subchromosomal abnormalities preceded or accompanied karyotype abnormalities and were associated with increased occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks. Our results indicate that enzymatic single-cell passaging can be highly deleterious to the hPSC genome, even when used only for a limited period of time.

To analyze the genes regulated by OtpR under acid stress, we performed RNA-seq whole transcriptome analysis of 16 MΔotpR and 16 M. In total, 501 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 390 down-regulated and 111 up-regulated genes.

Notably, OtpR regulated many Brucella virulence factors essential for B. melitensis intracellular survival. For instance, the virB operon encoding type IV secretion system was significantly down-regulated, and 36 known transcriptional regulators (e.g., vjbR and blxR) were differentially expressed in 16 MΔotpR. Selected RNA-seq results were experimentally confirmed by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR.

To minimize the effects of random biological variation, humeri from different preparations were pooled (approximately 75 wildtype and 60 Runx2-/- for each of the two biological replicates).","Runx2 is an essential factor for skeletogenesis and heterozygous loss causes cleidocranial dysplasia in humans and a corresponding phenotype in the mouse. Homozygous Runx2-deficient mice lack hypertrophic cartilage and bone. We compared the expression profiles of E14.5 wildtype and Runx2(-/-) murine embryonal humeri to identify new transcripts potentially involved in cartilage and bone development. Seventy-one differentially expressed genes were identified by two independent oligonucleotide-microarray hybridizations and quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated an enrichment of the differentially regulated genes in annotations to terms such as extracellular, skeletal development, and ossification. In situ hybridization on E15.5 limb sections was performed for all 71 differentially regulated genes. For 54 genes conclusive in situ hybridization results were obtained and all of them showed skeletal expression. Co-expression with Runx2 was demonstrated for 44 genes. While 41 of the 71 differentially expressed genes have a known role in bone and cartilage, we identified 21 known genes that have not yet been implicated in skeletal development and 9 entirely new transcripts.

Such ESC-derived adipocytes mimic the gene-expression profile of subcutaneous isolated adipocytes in vivo remarkably well, much closer than 3T3-L1 derived ones.

We genetically labeled satellite cells in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to follow their fate during the progression of the disease. We observed that a fraction of satellite cells had a reduced myogenic potential and showed enhanced expression of profibrotic genes compared to age-matched controls. By combining in vitro and in vivo results, we found that expression of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) was induced in response to elevated canonical Wnt signaling in dystrophic muscles and that the resulting increase in TGFβ activity affected the behavior of satellite cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of the TGFβ pathway in vivo reduced the fibrogenic characteristics of satellite cells. These studies shed new light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for stem cell dysfunction in dystrophic muscle and may contribute to the development of more effective and specific therapeutic approaches for the prevention of muscle fibrosis.","['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle Development', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Prosite accession number', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'MAT', 'Annotation track', 'Mice or rats', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'Microsatellites', 'Selection detection', 'Transcription', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping']"
26372730,Genome-wide analysis of p53 transcriptional programs in B cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress in vivo [RNA-Seq],"The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates the cellular response to DNA damage. Here we provide an integrated analysis of p53 genomic occupancy and p53-dependent gene regulation in the splenic B and non-B cell compartments of mice exposed to whole-body ionizing radiation, providing insight into general principles of p53 activity in vivo. In unstressed conditions, p53 bound few genomic targets; induction of p53 by ionizing radiation increased the number of p53 bound sites, leading to highly overlapping profiles in the different cell types. Comparison of these profiles with chromatin features in unstressed B cells revealed that, upon activation, p53 localized at active promoters, distal enhancers, and a smaller set of unmarked distal regions. At promoters, recognition of the canonical p53 motif as well as binding strength were associated with p53-dependent transcriptional activation, but not repression, indicating that the latter was most likely indirect. p53-activated targets constituted the core of a cell type-independent response, superimposed onto a cell type-specific program. Core response genes included most of the known p53-regulated genes, as well as many new ones. Our data represent a unique characterization of the p53-regulated response to ionizing radiation in vivo.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Phenotype name', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'protein', 'Tumor annotation', 'Protein expression', 'Whole gene prediction', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Whole genome methylation analysis']"
25475669,Expression data from WT Col-0 and the pdx1.3 ko mutant of Arabidopsis,"Vitamin B(6) (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) is an essential cofactor of many metabolic enzymes. Plants biosynthesize the vitamin de novo employing two enzymes, pyridoxine synthase1 (PDX1) and PDX2. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), there are two catalytically active paralogs of PDX1 (PDX1.1 and PDX1.3) producing the vitamin at comparable rates. Since single mutants are viable but the pdx1.1 pdx1.3 double mutant is lethal, the corresponding enzymes seem redundant. However, the single mutants exhibit substantial phenotypic differences, particularly at the level of root development, with pdx1.3 being more impaired than pdx1.1. Here, we investigate the differential regulation of PDX1.1 and PDX1.3 by identifying factors involved in their disparate phenotypes. Swapped-promoter experiments clarify the presence of distinct regulatory elements in the upstream regions of both genes. Exogenous sucrose (Suc) triggers impaired ethylene production in both mutants but is more severe in pdx1.3 than in pdx1.1. Interestingly, Suc specifically represses PDX1.1 expression, accounting for the stronger vitamin B6 deficit in pdx1.3 compared with pdx1.1. Surprisingly, Suc enhances auxin levels in pdx1.1, whereas the levels are diminished in pdx1.3. In the case of pdx1.3, the previously reported reduced meristem activity combined with the impaired ethylene and auxin levels manifest the specific root developmental defects. Moreover, it is the deficit in ethylene production and/or signaling that triggers this outcome. On the other hand, we hypothesize that it is the increased auxin content of pdx1.1 that is responsible for the root developmental defects observed therein. We conclude that PDX1.1 and PDX1.3 play partially nonredundant roles and are differentially regulated as manifested in disparate root growth impairment morphologies.","['Arabidopsis/*growth & development/metabolism/physiology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Indoleacetic Acids/metabolism', 'Nitrogenous Group Transferases/metabolism/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Growth Regulators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Plant Roots/*growth & development', 'Vitamin B 6/biosynthesis/*physiology']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Carbon cycle', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Carbohydrates', 'Epistasis', 'Nucleic acids', 'ACE', 'HET group name', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term']"
20662890,Synechococcus phage S-SSM7 genome sequencing project,"T4-like myoviruses are ubiquitous, and their genes are among the most abundant documented in ocean systems. Here we compare 26 T4-like genomes, including 10 from non-cyanobacterial myoviruses, and 16 from marine cyanobacterial myoviruses (cyanophages) isolated on diverse Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus hosts. A core genome of 38 virion construction and DNA replication genes was observed in all 26 genomes, with 32 and 25 additional genes shared among the non-cyanophage and cyanophage subsets, respectively. These hierarchical cores are highly syntenic across the genomes, and sampled to saturation. The 25 cyanophage core genes include six previously described genes with putative functions (psbA, mazG, phoH, hsp20, hli03, cobS), a hypothetical protein with a potential phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain, two virion structural genes, and 16 hypothetical genes. Beyond previously described cyanophage-encoded photosynthesis and phosphate stress genes, we observed core genes that may play a role in nitrogen metabolism during infection through modulation of 2-oxoglutarate. Patterns among non-core genes that may drive niche diversification revealed that phosphorus-related gene content reflects source waters rather than host strain used for isolation, and that carbon metabolism genes appear associated with putative mobile elements. As well, phages isolated on Synechococcus had higher genome-wide %G+C and often contained different gene subsets (e.g. petE, zwf, gnd, prnA, cpeT) than those isolated on Prochlorococcus. However, no clear diagnostic genes emerged to distinguish these phage groups, suggesting blurred boundaries possibly due to cross-infection. Finally, genome-wide comparisons of both diverse and closely related, co-isolated genomes provide a locus-to-locus variability metric that will prove valuable for interpreting metagenomic data sets.","['Bacteriophage T4/classification/*genetics', 'Base Composition', 'Cyanobacteria/*virology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Ketoglutaric Acids/*metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myoviridae/classification/*genetics', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Prochlorococcus/virology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*metabolism', 'Seawater/microbiology/*virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Synechococcus/virology', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Tail Proteins/genetics', 'Water Microbiology']","['Sequence composition report', 'Word composition', 'Protein sequence composition', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Nucleic acids', 'Metagenomics', 'Genomics', 'Metagenomic sequencing', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Compound identifier', 'Protein quaternary structure prediction', 'Compound name', 'Waters RAW', 'Freshwater biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biology']"
21844365,Cyanophage NATL1A-7 genome sequencing project,"Cyanophages infecting the marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus encode and express genes for the photosynthetic light reactions. Sequenced cyanophage genomes lack Calvin cycle genes, however, suggesting that photosynthetic energy harvested via phage proteins is not used for carbon fixation. We report here that cyanophages carry and express a Calvin cycle inhibitor, CP12, whose host homologue directs carbon flux from the Calvin cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Phage CP12 was coexpressed with phage genes involved in the light reactions, deoxynucleotide biosynthesis, and the PPP, including a transaldolase gene that is the most prevalent PPP gene in cyanophages. Phage transaldolase was purified to homogeneity from several strains and shown to be functional in vitro, suggesting that it might facilitate increased flux through this key reaction in the host PPP, augmenting production of NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate. Kinetic measurements of phage and host transaldolases revealed that the phage enzymes have k(cat)/K(m) values only approximately one third of the corresponding host enzymes. The lower efficiency of phage transaldolase may be a tradeoff for other selective advantages such as reduced gene size: we show that more than half of host-like cyanophage genes are significantly shorter than their host homologues. Consistent with decreased Calvin cycle activity and increased PPP and light reaction activity under infection, the host NADPH/NADP ratio increased two-fold in infected cells. We propose that phage-augmented NADPH production fuels deoxynucleotide biosynthesis for phage replication, and that the selection pressures molding phage genomes involve fitness advantages conferred through mobilization of host energy stores.","['Bacteriophages/enzymology/*genetics', 'Carbon/*metabolism', 'Cyanobacteria/enzymology/*metabolism/virology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transaldolase/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate accession', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Sequence features', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Kinetic model', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

To identify such enzymes, we have sequenced the genome of the polycaprolactone-degrading bacterium Moritella sp. JT01, isolated from sediment samples from Japan Trench (6957 m depth), using a Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (12.1 million paired-end reads) and CLC Genomics Workbench (version 6.5.1) for the assembly, resulting in a 4.83-Mb genome (42 scaffolds). The genome was annotated using Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST), Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (PHYRE2), and BLAST2Go, revealing 4439 protein coding sequences and 101 RNAs. Gene products with industrial relevance, such as lipases (three) and esterases (four), were identified and are related to bacterium's ability to degrade polycaprolactone. The annotation revealed proteins related to deep-sea survival, such as cold-shock proteins (six) and desaturases (three). The presence of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters suggests that this bacterium could produce nonribosomal peptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and bacteriocins. To demonstrate the potential of this genome, a lipase was cloned an introduced into Escherichia coli. The lipase was purified and characterized, showing activity over a wide temperature range (over 50% at 20-60 °C) and pH range (over 80% at pH 6.3 to 9). This enzyme has tolerance to the surfactant action of sodium dodecyl sulfate and shows 30% increased activity when subjected to a working pressure of 200 MPa.

17785507,Comparison of rapidly vs. slowly dividing CD8 T cells during acute homeostatic proliferation,"The host responds to lymphopenic environments by acute homeostatic proliferation, which is a cytokine- and endogenous peptide-driven expansion of lymphocytes that restores the numbers and diversity of T cells. It is unknown how these homeostatically proliferating (HP) cells are ultimately controlled. Using a system where lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-immune C57BL/6 splenocytes were transferred into lymphopenic T cell-deficient hosts and allowed to reconstitute the environment, we defined the following three populations of T cells: slowly dividing Ly6C+ cells, which contained bona fide virus-specific memory cells, and more rapidly dividing Ly6C- cells segregating into programmed death (PD)-1+ and PD-1- fractions. The PD-1+ HP cell population, which peaked in frequency at day 21, was dysfunctional in that it failed to produce interferon gamma or tumor necrosis factor alpha on T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, had down-regulated expression of interleukin (IL)-7Ralpha, IL-15Rbeta, and Bcl-2, and reacted with Annexin V, which is indicative of a preapoptotic state. The PD-1+ HP cells, in contrast to other HP cell fractions, displayed highly skewed TCR repertoires, which is indicative of oligoclonal expansion; these skewed repertoires and the PD-1+ population disappeared by day 70 from the host, presumably because of apoptosis. These results suggest that PD-1 may play a negative regulatory role to control rapidly proliferating and potentially pathogenic autoreactive CD8+ T cells during homeostatic reconstitution of lymphopenic environments.","['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Homeostasis/*immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Toxin annotation', 'Indexing', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulatory network analysis', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Epistasis', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Active site prediction', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Reaction data', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'R script', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"

In this study we surveyed natural genomic variation in cytosine methylation among Arabidopsis thaliana wild accessions Columbia (Col) and Vancouver (Van) by comparing hybridization intensity difference between genomic DNA digested with either methylation-sensitive (HpaII) or -insensitive (MspI) restriction enzyme. Single Feature Polymorphisms (SFPs) were assayed on a full set of 1,683,620 unique features of Arabidopsis Tiling Array 1.0F (Affymetrix), while constitutive and polymorphic CG methylation were assayed on a subset of 54,519 features, which contain a 5'CCGG3' restriction site. 138,552 SFPs (1% FDR) were identified across enzyme treatments, which preferentially accumulated in pericentromeric regions. Our study also demonstrates that at least 8% of all analyzed CCGG sites were constitutively methylated across the two strains, while about 10% of all analyzed CCGG sites were differentially methylated between the two strains. Within euchromatin arms, both constitutive and polymorphic CG methylation accumulated in central regions of genes but under-represented toward the 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequences. Nevertheless, polymorphic methylation occurred much more frequently in gene ends than constitutive methylation. Inheritance of methylation polymorphisms in reciprocal F1 hybrids was predominantly additive, with F1 plants generally showing levels of methylation intermediate between the parents. By comparing gene expression profiles, using matched tissue samples, we found that magnitude of methylation polymorphism immediately upstream or downstream of the gene was inversely correlated with the degree of expression variation for that gene. In contrast, methylation polymorphism within genic region showed weak positive correlation with expression variation. Our results demonstrated extensive genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms between Arabidopsis accessions and suggested a possible relationship between natural CG methylation variation and gene expression variation.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Plant/chemistry/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome, Plant', 'Genomics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Plant biology', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Epistasis', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Genome map', 'Genome alignment', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Phenomics', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'Polymorphism report format', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Here, we defined Bcl6 target genes in Tfh cells by analyzing genome-wide Bcl6 occupancy together with transcriptome profiling. With consensus sequences being different from those in Th9, B cells, and macrophages, Bcl6 binding in Tfh cell was closely associated with a decrease in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Importantly, Bcl6 promoted Tfh cell differentiation through antagonizing IL-7R (CD127)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 axis; deletion of the Bcl6 gene in T cells resulted in enhanced IL-7R-STAT5 signaling and substantial expansion of CD127(hi) non-Tfh cells.

Previously, expensive and labor-intensive BAC-based techniques were used to sequence the Y for a handful of mammalian species. Here, we present a much faster and more affordable strategy for sequencing and assembling mammalian Y Chromosomes of sufficient quality for most comparative genomics analyses and for conservation genetics applications. The strategy combines flow sorting, short- and long-read genome and transcriptome sequencing, and droplet digital PCR with novel and existing computational methods. It can be used to reconstruct sex chromosomes in a heterogametic sex of any species. We applied our strategy to produce a draft of the gorilla Y sequence. The resulting assembly allowed us to refine gene content, evaluate copy number of ampliconic gene families, locate species-specific palindromes, examine the repetitive element content, and produce sequence alignments with human and chimpanzee Y Chromosomes. Our results inform the evolution of the hominine (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) Y Chromosomes.

The Gene Master Regulators (GMRs) were defined as genes whose highly controlled expression by the homeostatic mechanisms commands the cell phenotype by modulating major functional pathways through expression correlation with their genes. The Gene Commanding Height (GCH), a measure that combines the expression control and expression correlation with all other genes, is used to establish the gene hierarchy in each cell phenotype. We developed the experimental protocol, the mathematical algorithm and the computer software to identify the GMRs from transcriptomic data in surgically removed tumors, biopsies or blood from cancer patients. The GMR approach is illustrated with applications to our microarray data on human kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer samples, and on thyroid, prostate and blood cancer cell lines. We proved experimentally that each patient has his/her own GMRs, that cancer nuclei and surrounding normal tissue are governed by different GMRs, and that manipulating the expression has larger consequences for genes with higher GCH. Therefore, we launch the hypothesis that silencing the GMR may selectively kill the cancer cells from a tissue.","['Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Software', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Theoretical biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Mathematical modelling', 'Personalised medicine', 'Medicine', 'Pain medicine', 'Software engineering']"
26455392,EGFR Mutation Promotes Glioblastoma Through Epigenome and Transcription Factor Network Remodeling,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification and mutations are the most common oncogenic events in glioblastoma (GBM), but the mechanisms by which they promote aggressive tumor growth are not well understood. Here, through integrated epigenome and transcriptome analyses of cell lines, genotyped clinical samples, and TCGA data, we show that EGFR mutations remodel the activated enhancer landscape of GBM, promoting tumorigenesis through a SOX9 and FOXG1-dependent transcriptional regulatory network in vitro and in vivo. The most common EGFR mutation, EGFRvIII, sensitizes GBM cells to the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 in a SOX9, FOXG1-dependent manner. These results identify the role of transcriptional/epigenetic remodeling in EGFR-dependent pathogenesis and suggest a mechanistic basis for epigenetic therapy.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Strain name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Structural transformation matrix', 'Format', 'Information extraction', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Plant biology', 'Transposon prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics', 'Molecules', 'SMILES string']"
27999094,The methylome of Alu repeats in colon cancer (CGH),"Cancer cells exhibit multiple epigenetic changes with prominent local DNA hypermethylation and widespread hypomethylation affecting large chromosomal domains. Epigenome studies often disregard the study of repeat elements owing to technical complexity and their undefined role in genome regulation. We have developed NSUMA (Next-generation Sequencing of UnMethylated Alu), a cost-effective approach allowing the unambiguous interrogation of DNA methylation in more than 130,000 individual Alu elements, the most abundant retrotransposon in the human genome. DNA methylation profiles of Alu repeats have been analyzed in colon cancers and normal tissues using NSUMA and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Normal cells show a low proportion of unmethylated Alu (1%-4%) that may increase up to 10-fold in cancer cells. In normal cells, unmethylated Alu elements tend to locate in the vicinity of functionally rich regions and display epigenetic features consistent with a direct impact on genome regulation. In cancer cells, Alu repeats are more resistant to hypomethylation than other retroelements. Genome segmentation based on high/low rates of Alu hypomethylation allows the identification of genomic compartments with differential genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features. Alu hypomethylated regions show low transcriptional activity, late DNA replication, and its extent is associated with higher chromosomal instability. Our analysis demonstrates that Alu retroelements contribute to define the epigenetic landscape of normal and cancer cells and provides a unique resource on the epigenetic dynamics of a principal, but largely unexplored, component of the primate genome.","['Alu Elements/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans']","['Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Human biology', 'Human disease']"

26744418,Targeted proteolysis of the histone H3 tail facilitates epigentic reporgramming during differentiation,"Although limited proteolysis of the histone H3 N-terminal tail (H3NT) is frequently observed during mammalian differentiation, the specific genomic sites targeted for H3NT proteolysis and the functional significance of H3NT cleavage remain largely unknown. Here we report the first method to identify and examine H3NT-cleaved regions in mammals, called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of acetylated chromatin (ChIPac). By applying ChIPac combined with deep sequencing (ChIPac-seq) to an established cell model of osteoclast differentiation, we discovered that H3NT proteolysis is selectively targeted near transcription start sites of a small group of genes and that most H3NT-cleaved genes displayed significant expression changes during osteoclastogenesis. We also discovered that the principal H3NT protease of osteoclastogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). In contrast to other known H3NT proteases, MMP-9 primarily cleaved H3K18-Q19 in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, our results support CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of H3K18 as a central regulator of MMP-9 H3NT protease activity both in vitro and at H3NT cleavage sites during osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, we found that abrogation of H3NT proteolysis impaired osteoclastogenic gene activation concomitant with defective osteoclast differentiation. Our collective results support the necessity of MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis in regulating gene pathways required for proficient osteoclastogenesis.","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Proteolysis']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Matrix', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein cleavage sites and proteolysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
17259616,Experimentally evolved Pseudomonas moraviensis R28-S raw sequence reads,"Broad-host-range (BHR) IncP-1 plasmids have the ability to transfer between and replicate in nearly all species of the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, but surprisingly few data are available on the stability of these plasmids in strains within their host range. Moreover, even though molecular interactions between the bacterial host and its plasmid(s) exist, no systematic study to date has compared the stability of the same plasmid among different hosts. The goal of this study was to examine whether the stability characteristics of an IncP-1 plasmid can be variable between strains within the host range of the plasmid. Therefore, 19 strains within the Alpha-, Beta- or Gammaproteobacteria carrying the IncP-1beta plasmid pB10 were serially propagated in non-selective medium and the fraction of segregants was monitored through replica-picking. Remarkably, a large variation in the stability of pB10 in different strains was found, even between strains within the same genus or species. Ten strains showed no detectable plasmid loss over about 200 generations, and in two strains plasmid-free clones were only sporadically observed. In contrast, three strains, Pseudomonas koreensis R28, Pseudomonas putida H2 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia P21, exhibited rapid plasmid loss within 80 generations. Parameter estimation after mathematical modelling of these stability data suggested high frequencies of segregation (about 0.04 per generation) or high plasmid cost (i.e. a relative fitness decrease in plasmid-bearing cells of about 15 and 40 %), which was confirmed experimentally. The models also suggested that plasmid reuptake by conjugation only played a significant role in plasmid stability in one of the three strains. Four of the 19 strains lost the plasmid very slowly over about 600 generations. The erratic decrease of the plasmid-containing fraction and simulation of the data with a new mathematical model suggested that plasmid cost was variable over time due to compensatory mutations. The findings of this study demonstrate that the ability of a so-called 'BHR' plasmid to persist in a bacterial population is influenced by strain-specific traits, and therefore observations made for one strain should not be generalized for the entire species or genus.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', '*Conjugation, Genetic', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Models, Biological', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Proteobacteria/*classification/*genetics/growth & development', 'Species Specificity']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcript report', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Plasmid map drawing', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"
15028702,Causes leptospirosis,"Leptospira species colonize a significant proportion of rodent populations worldwide and produce life-threatening infections in accidental hosts, including humans. Complete genome sequencing of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni and comparative analysis with the available Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai genome reveal that despite overall genetic similarity there are significant structural differences, including a large chromosomal inversion and extensive variation in the number and distribution of insertion sequence elements. Genome sequence analysis elucidates many of the novel aspects of leptospiral physiology relating to energy metabolism, oxygen tolerance, two-component signal transduction systems, and mechanisms of pathogenesis. A broad array of transcriptional regulation proteins and two new families of afimbrial adhesins which contribute to host tissue colonization in the early steps of infection were identified. Differences in genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide O side chains between the Copenhageni and Lai serovars were identified, offering an important starting point for the elucidation of the organism's complex polysaccharide surface antigens. Differences in adhesins and in lipopolysaccharide might be associated with the adaptation of serovars Copenhageni and Lai to different animal hosts. Hundreds of genes encoding surface-exposed lipoproteins and transmembrane outer membrane proteins were identified as candidates for development of vaccines for the prevention of leptospirosis.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Cricetinae', '*Genome, Bacterial', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leptospira interrogans/classification/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Leptospirosis/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serotyping', 'Virulence/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Rice', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Genotyping', 'Genotyping experiment', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
19882696,Dynamic cell culture in bubble-confined cell array,"Responding to the need of creating an accurate and controlled microenvironment surrounding the cell while meeting the requirements for biological processes or pharmacological screening tests, we aimed at designing and developing a microscaled culture system suitable for analyzing the synergic effects of extracellular matrix proteins and soluble environments on cell phenotype in a high-throughput fashion. We produced cell arrays deposing micrometer-scale protein islands on hydrogels using a robotic DNA microarrayer, constrained the culture media in a droplet-like volume and developed a suitable perfusion system. The droplet-confined cell arrays were used either with conventional culture methods (batch operating system) or with automated stable and constant perfusion (steady-state operating system). Mathematical modeling assisted the experimental design and assessed efficient mass transport and proper fluidodynamic regimes. Cells cultured on arrayed islands (500 mum diameter) maintained the correct phenotype both after static and perfused conditions, confirmed by immunostaining and gene expression analyses through total RNA extraction. The mathematical model, validated using a particle tracking experiment, predicted the constant value of velocities over the cell arrays (less than 10% variation) ensuring the same mass transport regime. BrdU analysis on an average of 96 cell spots for each experimental condition showed uniform expression inside each cell island and low variability in the data (average of 13%). Perfused arrays showed longer doubling times when compared with static cultures. In addition, perfused cultures showed a reduced variability in the collected data, allowing to detect statistically significant differences in cell behavior depending on the spotted ECM protein.","['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Equipment Design', 'Hydrogels/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/instrumentation/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Array Analysis/instrumentation/*methods']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Medicine', 'Design', 'Protein design', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
20371714,In vitro study of gene expression and response to chemotherapy across 50 human-melanoma derived cell lines,"In-transit metastatic melanoma, which typically presents as multifocal lesions, provides a unique setting to evaluate the utility of gene signatures for defining optimal regional therapeutic strategies and assessing the efficacy of treatment. The goal of this study was to determine whether a single multifocal lesion is representative of residual tumor burden in terms of gene expression signatures predictive of response to therapy. Using microarray-based gene expression profiling, we examined 55 in-transit melanoma lesions across 29 patients with multifocal disease. Principal component analysis, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, one-way ANOVA, binary regression analysis, and gene signatures predictive of oncogenic pathway activation were used to compare patterns of gene expression across all multifocal lesions from a patient. Patterns of gene expression were highly similar (P < 0.006; average r = 0.979) across pretreatment lesions from a single patient compared with the significantly different patterns observed across patients (P < 0.05). The findings presented in this study show that individual melanoma tumor nodules in patients with multifocal disease harbor similar patterns of gene expression and a single lesion can be used to predict response to chemotherapy, evaluate the activation status of oncogenic signaling pathways, and characterize other aspects of the biology of an individual patient's disease. These results will facilitate the use of gene expression profiling in melanoma regional therapy clinical trials to not only select optimal regional chemotherapeutic agents but to also allow for a more rational identification of candidates for specific targeted therapies and evaluation of their therapeutic efficacy.

We identified dozens of previously uncharacterized genes that affect these known attributes as well as 40 infectivity mutants without obvious defects in these traits. The latter mutants affect predicted regulatory factors, secreted proteins, and immune-related factors, and represent powerful tools for elucidating novel virulence mechanisms.

Integration of shotgun sequence assembly with genetic mapping enabled chromosome-scale reconstruction of the genome. More than 45,000 putative protein-coding genes were identified. Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second, older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution, tandem gene duplication, and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis, ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene.

10645958,"Consensus linkage map for East Lansing, Compton, and Wageningen chicken populations","A consensus linkage map has been developed in the chicken that combines all of the genotyping data from the three available chicken mapping populations. Genotyping data were contributed by the laboratories that have been using the East Lansing and Compton reference populations and from the Animal Breeding and Genetics Group of the Wageningen University using the Wageningen/Euribrid population. The resulting linkage map of the chicken genome contains 1889 loci. A framework map is presented that contains 480 loci ordered on 50 linkage groups. Framework loci are defined as loci whose order relative to one another is supported by odds greater then 3. The possible positions of the remaining 1409 loci are indicated relative to these framework loci. The total map spans 3800 cM, which is considerably larger than previous estimates for the chicken genome. Furthermore, although the physical size of the chicken genome is threefold smaller then that of mammals, its genetic map is comparable in size to that of most mammals. The map contains 350 markers within expressed sequences, 235 of which represent identified genes or sequences that have significant sequence identity to known genes. This improves the contribution of the chicken linkage map to comparative gene mapping considerably and clearly shows the conservation of large syntenic regions between the human and chicken genomes. The compact physical size of the chicken genome, combined with the large size of its genetic map and the observed degree of conserved synteny, makes the chicken a valuable model organism in the genomics as well as the postgenomics era.

19235764,"mRNA expression data in Δrsf1mutant during growth on, and transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source","Previous studies from this laboratory indicated that the product of the RSF1 gene of S. cerevisiae is present in both nucleus and mitochondria, and they suggested that Rsf1p acts as a transcriptional modulator. To investigate this latter question, we performed transcriptome profiling of an rsf1 mutant strain and its wild-type parent during a shift from glucose-based fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth to identify genes whose expression is regulated by Rsf1p. Loss of Rsf1p engendered a decrease in transcript levels from many genes encoding components of the electron transport chain and various other mitochondrially-localized products. The earlier studies further showed that rsf1 cells exhibit a growth defect on medium containing glycerol, but not ethanol, as sole carbon source. Importantly, transcriptome profiling of the rsf1 mutant during shift from glucose- to glycerol-based medium revealed that the product of this gene plays a major role in both orchestration of the transition to, and maintenance of, efficient growth on glycerol as sole carbon source. An increase in transcript levels from genes encoding products that function in the stress response, and an imbalance between expression of genes encoding glycerol anabolic and catabolic enzymes, was observed in the rsf1 mutant during steady-state growth on glycerol- but not ethanol-based medium; this suggests the presence of partially separate transcriptional regulatory systems for transition to respiratory growth on each of these two carbon sources. Genes whose expression is affected by loss of Rsf1p, which lacks a known DNA-binding motif, lack a common DNA sequence motif in their upstream regions. These and other data presented here strongly suggest that the transcriptional effects exerted by Rsf1p are mediated via interaction with other transcription factors.","['CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Fermentation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glycerol/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxygen Consumption/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism/physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors']","['Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Documentation and help', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'KEGG Glycan ID', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Generation', 'consensus', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription', 'Transcription factor accession']"
18385275,Array-CGH analysis of X chromosome of XLMR patient,"Recurrent submicroscopic genomic copy number changes are the result of nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Nonrecurrent aberrations, however, can result from different nonexclusive recombination-repair mechanisms. We previously described small microduplications at Xq28 containing MECP2 in four male patients with a severe neurological phenotype. Here, we report on the fine-mapping and breakpoint analysis of 16 unique microduplications. The size of the overlapping copy number changes varies between 0.3 and 2.3 Mb, and FISH analysis on three patients demonstrated a tandem orientation. Although eight of the 32 breakpoint regions coincide with low-copy repeats, none of the duplications are the result of NAHR. Bioinformatics analysis of the breakpoint regions demonstrated a 2.5-fold higher frequency of Alu interspersed repeats as compared with control regions, as well as a very high GC content (53%). Unexpectedly, we obtained the junction in only one patient by long-range PCR, which revealed nonhomologous end joining as the mechanism. Breakpoint analysis in two other patients by inverse PCR and subsequent array comparative genomic hybridization analysis demonstrated the presence of a second duplicated region more telomeric at Xq28, of which one copy was inserted in between the duplicated MECP2 regions. These data suggest a two-step mechanism in which part of Xq28 is first inserted near the MECP2 locus, followed by breakage-induced replication with strand invasion of the normal sister chromatid. Our results indicate that the mechanism by which copy number changes occur in regions with a complex genomic architecture can yield complex rearrangements.","['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Computational Biology', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', '*Gene Duplication', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Retardation, X-Linked/*genetics', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'pair', 'DNA', 'dna', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Gene classification', 'Gene ID', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Linked data format', 'JSON-LD', 'Protein binding sites', 'protein', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Recombination detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
27226174,"Differential gene expression in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum among crossbred beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes.","Small intestine mass and cellularity were previously associated with cattle feed efficiency. The small intestine is responsible for the digestion of nutrients and absorption of fatty acids, amino acids and carbohydrates, and it contributes to the overall feed efficiency of cattle. The objective of this study was to evaluate transcriptome differences among the small intestine from cattle with divergent gain and feed intake. Animals most divergent from the bivariate mean in each of the four phenotypic Cartesian quadrants for gain × intake were selected, and the transcriptomes of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were evaluated. Gene expression analyses were performed comparing high gain vs. low gain animals, high intake vs. low intake animals and each of the phenotypic quadrants to all other groups. Genes differentially expressed within the high gain-low intake and low gain-high intake groups of animals included those involved in immune function and inflammation in all small intestine sections. The high gain-high intake group differed from the high gain-low intake group by immune response genes in all sections of the small intestine. In all sections of small intestine, animals with low gain-low intake displayed greater abundance of heat-shock genes compared to other groups. Several over-represented pathways were identified. These include the antigen-processing/presentation pathway in high gain animals and PPAR signaling, starch/sucrose metabolism, retinol metabolism and melatonin degradation pathways in the high intake animals. Genes with functions in immune response, inflammation, stress response, influenza pathogenesis and melatonin degradation pathways may have a relationship with gain and intake in beef steers.","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Breeding', 'Cattle/*genetics', 'Duodenum/*metabolism', 'Eating/*genetics', 'Ileum/*metabolism', 'Jejunum/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Red Meat', '*Transcriptome', 'Weight Gain/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Tree dating', 'Formatting', 'Editing', 'Pileup', 'MAT', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Experimental measurement', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Protein fragment weight comparison']"

26568296,Intra-tumor Genetic Heterogeneity in Rectal Canger,"Colorectal cancer arises in part from the cumulative effects of multiple gene lesions. Recent studies in selected cancer types have revealed significant intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity and highlighted its potential role in disease progression and resistance to therapy. We hypothesized the existence of significant intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in rectal cancers involving variations in localized somatic mutations and copy number abnormalities. Two or three spatially disparate regions from each of six rectal tumors were dissected and subjected to the next-generation whole-exome DNA sequencing, Oncoscan SNP arrays, and targeted confirmatory sequencing and analysis. The resulting data were integrated to define subclones using SciClone. Mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) scores, mutant allele frequency correlation, and mutation percent concordance were calculated, and copy number analysis including measurement of correlation between samples was performed. Somatic mutations profiles in individual cancers were similar to prior studies, with some variants found in previously reported significantly mutated genes and many patient-specific mutations in each tumor. Significant intra-tumor heterogeneity was identified in the spatially disparate regions of individual cancers. All tumors had some heterogeneity but the degree of heterogeneity was quite variable in the samples studied. We found that 67-97% of exonic somatic mutations were shared among all regions of an individual's tumor. The SciClone computational method identified 2-8 shared and unshared subclones in the spatially disparate areas in each tumor. MATH scores ranged from 7 to 41. Allele frequency correlation scores ranged from R(2)=0.69-0.96. Measurements of correlation between samples for copy number changes varied from R(2)=0.74-0.93. All tumors had some heterogeneity, but the degree was highly variable in the samples studied. The occurrence of significant intra-tumor heterogeneity may allow selected tumors to have a genetic reservoir to draw from in their evolutionary response to therapy and other challenges.","['Aged', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage/genetics', 'Gene Frequency/*genetics', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Rectal Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'Rectum/chemistry']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Gene ID', 'Gene map', 'Gene name', 'Position frequency matrix', 'Phylogenetic gene frequencies data', 'Species frequency estimation', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetics', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection']"

Here, we show an alternative and previously unknown bivalent modified histone signature in lineage-committed mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes that pairs H3K4me3 with H3K9me3 to maintain adipogenic master regulatory genes (Cebpa and Pparg) expressed at low levels yet poised for activation when differentiation is required. We show lineage-specific gene-body DNA methylation recruits H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, which methylates H3K9 immediately downstream of transcription start sites marked with H3K4me3 to establish the bivalent domain. At the Cebpa locus, this prevents transcription factor C/EBPβ binding, histone acetylation, and further H3K4me3 deposition and is associated with pausing of RNA polymerase II, which limits Cebpa gene expression and adipogenesis.","['3T3 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']","['cel', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Proteins', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Histogram', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Protein structure analysis']"
27052102,82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 ChIP-seq after vehicle or amyloid-beta exposure,"The M-transcript of human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) produces an 82-kDa protein (82-kDa ChAT) that concentrates in nuclei of cholinergic neurons. We assessed the effects of acute exposure to oligomeric amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) on 82-kDa ChAT disposition in SH-SY5Y neural cells, finding that acute exposure to Aβ1-42 results in increased association of 82-kDa ChAT with chromatin and formation of 82-kDa ChAT aggregates in nuclei. When measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified that Aβ1-42-exposure increases 82-kDa ChAT association with gene promoters and introns. The Aβ1-42-induced 82-kDa ChAT aggregates co-localize with special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), which anchors DNA to scaffolding/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs). SATB1 had a similar genomic association as 82-kDa ChAT, with both proteins associating with synapse and cell stress genes. After Aβ1-42 -exposure, both SATB1 and 82-kDa ChAT are enriched at the same S/MAR on the APP gene, with 82-kDa ChAT expression attenuating an increase in an isoform-specific APP mRNA transcript. Finally, 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 have patterned genomic association at regions enriched with S/MAR binding motifs. These results demonstrate that 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 play critical roles in the response of neural cells to acute Aβ-exposure.","['Amyloid beta-Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Introns/drug effects', 'Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Matrix Attachment Regions/*drug effects', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects']","['Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Protein signal peptides', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Introns', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Matrix/scaffold attachment sites', 'Matrix', 'S/MAR prediction', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Peptide molecular weight hits', 'Amino acid index (molecular weight)', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters']"

In prokaryotes, sRNAs are often bound to the chaperone protein Hfq, which allows them to interact with their partner mRNA(s). We screened the genome of the zoonotic and human pathogen Brucella suis 1330 for the presence of this class of RNAs. We designed a coimmunoprecipitation strategy that relies on the use of Hfq as a bait to enrich the sample with sRNAs and eventually their target mRNAs. By deep sequencing analysis of the Hfq-bound transcripts, we identified a number of mRNAs and 33 sRNA candidates associated with Hfq. The expression of 10 sRNAs in the early stationary growth phase was experimentally confirmed by Northern blotting and/or reverse transcriptase PCR.","['Animals', 'Brucella suis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/physiology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Host Factor 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular charge', 'Molecular property', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Training material', 'DNA translation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
26642431,Murine chondrocytes: Control vs Ad-Epas1 infected,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), two common types of arthritis, affect the joints mainly by targeting the synovium and cartilage. Increasing evidence indicates that a significant network connects synovitis and cartilage destruction during the progression of arthritis. We recently demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α causes RA and OA by regulating the expression of catabolic factors in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) or chondrocytes. To address the reciprocal influences of HIF-2α on FLS and chondrocytes, we applied an in vitro co-culture system using a transwell apparatus. When co-cultured with HIF-2α-overexpressing chondrocytes, FLS exhibited increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory mediators, similar to the effects induced by tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α treatment of FLS. Moreover, chondrocytes co-cultured with HIF-2α-overexpressing FLS exhibited upregulation of Mmp3 and Mmp13, which is similar to the effects induced by interleukin (IL)-6 treatment of chondrocytes. We confirmed these differential HIF-2α-induced effects via distinct secretory mediators using Il6-knockout cells and a TNF-α-blocking antibody. The FLS-co-culture-induced gene expression changes in chondrocytes were significantly abrogated by IL-6 deficiency, whereas TNF-α neutralization blocked the alterations in gene expression associated with co-culture of FLS with chondrocytes. Our results further suggested that the observed changes might reflect the HIF-2α-induced upregulation of specific receptors for TNF-α (in FLS) and IL-6 (in chondrocytes). This study broadens our understanding of the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between the synovium and cartilage in the presence of HIF-2α, and may suggest potential new anti-arthritis therapies.","['Animals', 'Arthritis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoarthritis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Synovial Membrane/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Mitochondria', 'Laboratory techniques', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Tumor annotation', 'Regulatory RNA']"
18670397,Seawater isolate,"Alteromonas macleodii is a common marine heterotrophic gamma-proteobacterium. Isolates from this microbe cluster by molecular analysis into two major genotypic groups or ecotypes, one found in temperate latitudes in the upper water column and another that is for the most part found in the deep water column of the Mediterranean. Here, we describe the genome of one strain of the 'deep ecotype' (AltDE) isolated from 1000 m in the Eastern Mediterranean and compare this genome with that of the type strain ATCC 27126, a representative of the global 'surface' ecotype. The genomes are substantially different with DNA sequence similarity values that are borderline for microbes belonging to the same species, and a large differential gene content, mainly found in islands larger than 20 kbp, that also recruit poorly to the Global Ocean Sampling project (GOS). These genomic differences indicate that AltDE is probably better suited to microaerophilic conditions and for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds such as urea. These, together with other features, and the distribution of this genotypic group, indicate that this microbe colonizes relatively large particles that sink rapidly to meso and bathypelagic depths. The genome of ATCC 27126 on the other hand has more potential for regulation (two component systems) and degrades more sugars and amino acids, which is consistent with a more transient particle attachment, as would be expected for lineages specialized in colonizing smaller particulate organic matter with much slower sinking rates.

Genome-wide analysis revealed that binding of Ezh2 and menin, central members of the PcG and TrxG complexes, respectively, were reciprocally correlated. Moreover, we identified a developmental change in the positioning of Ezh2 and menin in differentiated T lymphocytes compared to embryonic stem cells. Ezh2-binding upstream and menin-binding downstream of the transcription start site was frequently found at genes with higher transcriptional levels, and Ezh2-binding downstream and menin-binding upstream was found at genes with lower expression in T lymphocytes. Interestingly, of the Ezh2 and menin cooccupied genes, those exhibiting occupancy at the same position displayed greatly enhanced sensitivity to loss of Ezh2. Finally, we also found that different combinations of Ezh2 and menin occupancy were associated with expression of specific functional gene groups important for T cell development. Therefore, spatial cooperative gene regulation by the PcG and TrxG complexes may represent a novel mechanism regulating the transcriptional identity of differentiated cells.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Genome', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', '*Transcriptional Activation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'protein', 'Gene family report', 'Exonic splicing enhancer prediction', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Sequence complexity report', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
26727110,Genetic code expansion in stable cell lines enables encoded chromatin modification,"Genetically encoded unnatural amino acids provide powerful strategies for modulating the molecular functions of proteins in mammalian cells. However, this approach has not been coupled to genome-wide measurements, because efficient incorporation of unnatural amino acids is limited to transient expression settings that lead to very heterogeneous expression. We demonstrate that stable integration of the Methanosarcina mazei pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA(Pyl)CUA pair (and its derivatives) into the mammalian genome enables efficient, homogeneous incorporation of unnatural amino acids into target proteins in diverse mammalian cells, and we reveal the distinct transcriptional responses of embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts to amber codon suppression. Genetically encoding N-ɛ-acetyl-lysine in place of six lysine residues in histone H3 enables deposition of pre-acetylated histones into cellular chromatin, via a pathway that is orthogonal to enzymatic modification.

27309046,Avian influenza at the human-animal interface in Bangladesh,"In 2011, avian influenza surveillance at the Bangladesh live bird markets (LBMs) showed complete replacement of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus of clade 2.2.2 (Qinghai-like H5N1 lineage) by the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. This clade, which continues to circulate in Bangladesh and neighboring countries, is an intra-and interclade reassortant; its HA, polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase (PA), and nonstructural (NS) genes come from subclade 2.3.2.1a; the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) comes from subclade 2.3.2.1c; and the NA, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and matrix (M) gene from clade 2.3.4.2. The H9N2 influenza viruses cocirculating in the Bangladesh LBMs are also reassortants, possessing five genes (NS, M, NP, PA, and PB1) from an HPAI H7N3 virus previously isolated in Pakistan. Despite frequent coinfection of chickens and ducks, reassortment between these H5N1 and H9N2 viruses has been rare. However, all such reassortants detected in 2011 through 2013 have carried seven genes from the local HPAI H5N1 lineage and the PB1 gene from the Bangladeshi H9N2 clade G1 Mideast, itself derived from HPAI H7N3 virus.

Our follow-up studies find that lower blood DICER1 expression is significantly associated with increased amygdala activation to fearful stimuli, a neural correlate for PTSD. Additionally, a genetic variant in the 3' un-translated region of DICER1, rs10144436, is significantly associated with DICER1 expression and with PTSD&Dep, and the latter is replicated in an independent cohort. Furthermore, genome-wide differential expression survey of miRNAs in blood in PTSD&Dep reveals miRNAs to be significantly downregulated in cases versus controls.

Both cell types underwent dramatic transcriptomic changes and the differences between them became greater with follicular growth. Although cumulus cells of both stages of follicular development are competent to undergo expansion in vitro, they were otherwise remarkably dissimilar with transcriptomic changes quantitatively equivalent to those of MGCs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that cumulus cells of small follicles were enriched in transcripts generally associated with catalytic components of metabolic processes while those from large follicles were involved in regulation of metabolism, cell differentiation, and adhesion. Upon contrasting cumulus cells versus MGCs, cumulus cells were enriched in transcripts associated with metabolism and cell proliferation while MGCs were enriched for transcripts involved in cell signaling and differentiation.
Cumulus cell-oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from the ovaries of 22-day-old B6SJLF1 mice that were either not stimulated with eCG or stimulated by IP injection of 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin 44 hours before obtaining the COCs. Only COCs completely enclosed by tightly packed cumulus oophorus were selected for analysis. Cumulus cells were stripped from oocytes by drawing them into a fine glass pipet with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the oocytes, which were discarded. At the same time as collection of COCs, clumps of healthy MGCs having a rusty rather than brown color, which would indicated a less than healthy phenotype, were collected. Both cumulus cells and MGCs were lysed and prepared for micro-array. The cumulus cells from 200 COCs and a roughly equivalent mass of MGCs were collected from three groups of five pooled mice.

25802278,"Wnt signaling is critical for normal skeletal development as well as whole-body metabolic function.  In this study, we described a previously unrecognized function for Wnt-Lrp5 signaling in the osteoblast that allows bone to acquire the resources necessary to fuel bone formation.  Mice lacking the Lrp5 co-receptor specifically in osteoblasts and osteocytes exhibit the expected reductions in postnatal bone mass and also develop peripheral adiposity with corresponding reductions in energy expenditure.  Conversely, mice expressing a high-bone mass mutant Lrp5 allele are leaner with reduced plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels.  In this context, Wnt-initiated signals downstream of Lrp5, but not Lrp6, regulate the expression of key enzymes required for fatty acid β-oxidation.  These results suggest that Wnt-Lrp5 signaling regulates basic cellular activities beyond those associated with fate-specification and differentiation in bone and that the skeleton influences global energy homeostasis via mechanisms independent of osteocalcin and glucose metabolism

Conversely, mice expressing a high bone mass mutant Lrp5 allele are leaner with reduced plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels. In this context, Wnt-initiated signals downstream of Lrp5, but not the closely related Lrp6 coreceptor, regulate the activation of β-catenin and thereby induce the expression of key enzymes required for fatty acid β-oxidation. These results suggest that Wnt-Lrp5 signaling regulates basic cellular activities beyond those associated with fate specification and differentiation in bone and that the skeleton influences global energy homeostasis via mechanisms independent of osteocalcin and glucose metabolism.","['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-5/*metabolism', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Backbone modelling', 'Clone ID', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Fate map', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Protein optical density', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Proteogenomics', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Beta diversity data']"
26428397,"High-resolution temporal transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves during infection by Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 and DC3000hrpA-thaliana
RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaves after mock-inoculation, infection with P. syringae DC3000 and infection with P. syringae DC3000hrpA-. 13 time points (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17.5 hours post inoculation) were sampled from each treatment and four biological replicates (a single leaf) were harvested at each time point for each treatment. This led to 156 biological samples (13 time points x 3 treatments x 4 biological replicates). Four technical replicates of each biological sample were generated (624). The microarrays were two-channel CATMA arrays and hence two samples are hybridized to each array resulting in 312 arrays used in the experiment. A “loop design” was developed to enable efficient extraction of information about sample comparisons. Half the arrays were used to directly compare samples at different time points within the same treatment, and half directly compared the same time point and adjacent time points between treatments. This design maximizes the power of data comparisons over time and between treatments.","Pathogens target phytohormone signalling pathways to promote disease. Plants deploy salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defences against biotrophs. Pathogens antagonize SA immunity by activating jasmonate signalling, for example Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 produces coronatine (COR), a jasmonic acid (JA) mimic. This study found unexpected dynamics between SA, JA and COR and co-operation between JAZ jasmonate repressor proteins during DC3000 infection. We used a systems-based approach involving targeted hormone profiling, high-temporal-resolution micro-array analysis, reverse genetics and mRNA-seq. Unexpectedly, foliar JA did not accumulate until late in the infection process and was higher in leaves challenged with COR-deficient P. syringae or in the more resistant JA receptor mutant coi1. JAZ regulation was complex and COR alone was insufficient to sustainably induce JAZs. JAZs contribute to early basal and subsequent secondary plant defence responses. We showed that JAZ5 and JAZ10 specifically co-operate to restrict COR cytotoxicity and pathogen growth through a complex transcriptional reprogramming that does not involve the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MYC2 and related MYC3 and MYC4 previously shown to restrict pathogen growth. mRNA-seq predicts compromised SA signalling in a jaz5/10 mutant and rapid suppression of JA-related components on bacterial infection.","['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Arabidopsis/drug effects/genetics/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclopentanes/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/drug effects', 'Indenes/pharmacology', 'Isoleucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Oxylipins/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Diseases/*microbiology', 'Plant Growth Regulators/metabolism', 'Pseudomonas syringae/drug effects/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Virulence/drug effects']","['Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Pathway ID (Panther)', 'Synthetic biology', 'Panther Pathways entry format', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Data index', 'Index format', 'Indexing', 'Isolation report', 'Medicine', 'Molecular medicine', 'PHYLIP format', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Regulatory affairs', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier', 'Sequence']"
29513759,"This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below:GSE56313 and GSE56314PurposeCurrent diagnostic tests for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma use the updated WHO criteria based on biologic, morphologic, and clinical heterogeneity. We propose a refined classification sys-tem based on subset-specific B-cell–associated gene signatures (BAGS) in the normal B-cell hierarchy, hypothesizing that it can provide new biologic insight and diagnostic and prognostic value.Patients and MethodsWe combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting, gene expression profiling, and statistical modeling to generate BAGS for naive, centrocyte, centroblast, memory, and plasmablast B cells from normal human tonsils. The impact of BAGS-assigned subtyping was analyzed using five clinical cohorts (treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP], n _ 270; treated with rituximab plus CHOP [R-CHOP], n _ 869) gathered across geo-graphic regions, time eras, and sampling methods. The analysis estimated subtype frequencies and drug-specific resistance and included a prognostic meta-analysis of patients treated with first-line R-CHOP therapy.ResultsSimilar BAGS subtype frequencies were assigned across 1,139 samples from five different co-horts. Among R-CHOP–treated patients, BAGS assignment was significantly associated with overall survival and progression-free survival within the germinal center B-cell–like subclass; the centrocyte subtype had a superior prognosis compared with the centroblast subtype. In agreement with the observed therapeutic outcome, centrocyte subtypes wereestimated as being less resistant than the centroblast subtype to doxorubicin and vincristine. The centroblast subtype had a complex genotype, whereas the centrocyte subtype had high TP53 mutation and insertion/deletion frequencies and expressed LMO2, CD58, and stromal-1–signature and major histocompatibility complex class II–signature genes, which are known to have a positive impact on prognosis.ConclusionFurther development of a diagnostic platform using BAGS-assigned subtypes may allow pathogenetic studies to improve disease management.
Refer to individual Series","Diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involves blood cell counts, immunophenotyping, IgVH mutation status, and cytogenetic analyses. We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proof of Concept Study', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time-to-Treatment']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'DNA testing', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Feature selection', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Cell cycle', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'GO concept ID', 'EMAP concept ID', 'GO concept name', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum', 'Protein active sites', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'Retention time prediction']"
22128806,Isolation of Novel Multipotent Neural Crest-Derived Stem Cells from Adult Human Inferior Turbinate,"Adult human neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) are of extraordinary high plasticity and promising candidates for the use in regenerative medicine. Here we describe for the first time a novel neural crest-derived stem cell population within the respiratory epithelium of human adult inferior turbinate. In contrast to superior and middle turbinates, high amounts of source material could be isolated from human inferior turbinates. Using minimally-invasive surgery methods isolation is efficient even in older patients. Within their endogenous niche, inferior turbinate stem cells (ITSCs) expressed high levels of nestin, p75(NTR), and S100. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-p75 antibodies displayed that ITSCs are of glial origin and closely related to nonmyelinating Schwann cells. Cultivated ITSCs were positive for nestin and S100 and the neural crest markers Slug and SOX10. Whole genome microarray analysis showed pronounced differences to human ES cells in respect to pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, LIN28, and NANOG, whereas expression of WDR5, KLF4, and c-MYC was nearly similar. ITSCs were able to differentiate into cells with neuro-ectodermal and mesodermal phenotype. Additionally ITSCs are able to survive and perform neural crest typical chain migration in vivo when transplanted into chicken embryos. However ITSCs do not form teratomas in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Finally, we developed a separation strategy based on magnetic cell sorting of p75(NTR) positive ITSCs that formed larger neurospheres and proliferated faster than p75(NTR) negative ITSCs. Taken together our study describes a novel, readily accessible source of multipotent human NCSCs for potential cell-replacement therapy.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neural Crest/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Turbinates/*cytology/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Multiple sequence alignment', 'Multiple structure alignment', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'Restriction site creation', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Structural data', 'Structure clustering', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'PCR experiment', 'Reverse complement', 'Reaction ID', 'Cell line report', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Sequence coordinates']"
21847092,An Extended dsRBD with a Novel Zinc-Binding Motif Mediates Nuclear Retention of Fission Yeast Dicer,"Dicer proteins function in RNA interference (RNAi) pathways by generating small RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we report the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dicer (Dcr1). The structure reveals an unusual double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) fold embedding a novel zinc-binding motif that is conserved among dicers in yeast. Although the C-terminal domain of Dcr1 still binds nucleic acids, this property is dispensable for proper functioning of Dcr1. In contrast, disruption of zinc coordination renders Dcr1 mainly cytoplasmic and leads to remarkable changes in gene expression and loss of heterochromatin assembly. In summary, our results reveal novel insights into the mechanism of nuclear retention of Dcr1 and raise the possibility that this new class of dsRBDs might generally function in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and not substrate binding. The C-terminal domain of Dcr1 constitutes a novel regulatory module that might represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention with fungal diseases.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Endoribonucleases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*enzymology', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc/metabolism']","['Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Protein secondary structure', 'Protein secondary structure comparison', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA structure', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Zinc finger prediction', 'ZIP format']"
22199357,Cytoplasmic MTDH associates with mRNAs,"Overexpression of metadherin (MTDH) has been documented in many solid tumors and is implicated in metastasis and chemoresistance. MTDH has been detected at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and the function of MTDH in these locales remains under investigation. In the nucleus, MTDH acts as a transcription co-factor to induce expression of chemoresistance-associated genes. However, MTDH is predominantly cytoplasmic in prostate tumors, and this localization correlates with poor prognosis. Herein, we used endometrial cancer cells as a model system to define a new role for MTDH in the cytoplasm. First, MTDH was primarily localized to the cytoplasm in endometrial cancer cells, and the N-terminal region of MTDH was required to maintain cytoplasmic localization. Next, we identified novel binding partners for cytoplasmic MTDH, including RNA-binding proteins and components of the RNA-induced silencing complex. Nucleic acids were required for the association of MTDH with these cytoplasmic proteins. Furthermore, MTDH interacted with and regulated protein expression of multiple mRNAs, such as PDCD10 and KDM6A. Depletion of cytoplasmic MTDH was associated with increased stress granule formation, reduced survival in response to chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF1120, Rad51 nuclear accumulation, and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M. Finally, in vivo tumor formation was abrogated with knockdown of cytoplasmic MTDH. Taken together, our data identify a novel function for cytoplasmic MTDH as an RNA-binding protein. Our findings implicate cytoplasmic MTDH in cell survival and broad drug resistance via association with RNA and RNA-binding proteins.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Female', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Stress, Physiological/*physiology']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network analysis', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Molecules', 'Small molecules', 'Molecule accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug name', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Sequence', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"
22529359,Oxidative and electrophilic stress conditions and the sor1 mutant,"Acclimation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells to low levels of singlet oxygen, produced either by photoreactive chemicals or high light treatment, induces a specific genetic response that strongly increases the tolerance of the algae to subsequent exposure to normally lethal singlet oxygen-producing conditions. The genetic response includes the increased expression of various oxidative stress response and detoxification genes, like the glutathione peroxidase homologous gene GPXH/GPX5 and the σ-class glutathione-S-transferase gene GSTS1. To identify components involved in the signal transduction and activation of the singlet oxygen-mediated response, a mutant selection was performed. This selection led to the isolation of the singlet oxygen resistant 1 (sor1) mutant, which is more tolerant to singlet oxygen-producing chemicals and shows a constitutively higher expression of GPXH and GSTS1. Map-based cloning revealed that the SOR1 gene encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, which controls its own expression and the expression of a large number of oxidative stress response and detoxification genes. In the promoter region of many of these genes, a highly conserved 8-bp palindromic sequence element was found to be enriched. This element was essential for GSTS1 induction by increased levels of lipophilic reactive electrophile species (RES), suggesting that it functions as an electrophile response element (ERE). Furthermore, GSTS1 overexpression in sor1 requires the ERE, although it is unknown whether it occurs through direct binding of SOR1 to the ERE. RES can be formed after singlet oxygen-induced lipid peroxidation, indicating that RES-stimulated and SOR1-mediated responses of detoxification genes are part of the singlet oxygen-induced acclimation process in C. reinhardtii.","['Acclimatization/*genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, Plant/*genetics/physiology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidative Stress/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Singlet Oxygen/*metabolism']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular mass', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Protein ID (PeroxiBase)', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Single-Cell Sequencing', 'GEN', 'Single particle analysis']"
22445337,Transcriptional architecture of the primate neocortex,"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was used to characterize the molecular underpinnings of neocortical organization in rhesus macaque, including cortical areal specialization and laminar cell-type diversity. Microarray analysis of individual cortical layers across sensorimotor and association cortices identified robust and specific molecular signatures for individual cortical layers and areas, prominently involving genes associated with specialized neuronal function. Overall, transcriptome-based relationships were related to spatial proximity, being strongest between neighboring cortical areas and between proximal layers. Primary visual cortex (V1) displayed the most distinctive gene expression compared to other cortical regions in rhesus and human, both in the specialized layer 4 as well as other layers. Laminar patterns were more similar between macaque and human compared to mouse, as was the unique V1 profile that was not observed in mouse. These data provide a unique resource detailing neocortical transcription patterns in a nonhuman primate with great similarity in gene expression to human.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta/*anatomy & histology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microdissection', 'Neocortex/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Pathways/physiology', 'Neurons', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/*physiology']","['Genetic variation analysis', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Analysis', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', ""Ensembl ID ('Macaca mulatta')"", 'MAT', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Selection detection', 'Microbial collection', 'latex', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank', 'Pathway or network', 'Pathway ID (WikiPathways)', 'Signaling pathways', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Essential dynamics', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

22250091,Synergism between curdlan and GM-CSF in mouse dendritic cells,"A simultaneous engagement of different pathogen recognition receptors provides a tailor-made adaptive immunity for an efficient defense against distinct pathogens. For example, cross-talk of TLR and C-type lectin signaling effectively shapes distinct gene expression patterns by integrating the signals at the level of NF-κB. In this study, we extend this principle to a strong synergism between the dectin-1 agonist curdlan and an inflammatory growth factor, GM-CSF. Both together act in synergy in inducing a strong inflammatory signature that converts immature dendritic cells (DCs) to potent effector DCs. A variety of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-12p70), costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD70), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL12, CCL17), as well as receptors and molecules involved in fugal recognition and immunity such as Mincle, dectin-1, dectin-2, and pentraxin 3 are strongly upregulated in DC treated simultaneously with curdlan and GM-CSF. The synergistic effect of both stimuli resulted in strong IκBα phosphorylation, its rapid degradation, and enhanced nuclear translocation of all NF-κB subunits. We further identified MAPK ERK as one possible integration site of both signals, because its phosphorylation was clearly augmented when curdlan was coapplied with GM-CSF. Our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory activity of curdlan requires an additional signal provided by GM-CSF to successfully initiate a robust β-glucan-specific cytokine and chemokine response. The integration of both signals clearly prime and tailor a more effective innate and adaptive response against invading microbes and fungi.","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology/pharmacology', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', '*Immunologic Factors', 'Lectins, C-Type/agonists/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'beta-Glucans/*immunology/pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Cheminformatics', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Drug metabolism', 'Drug name', 'Drug report', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Beta diversity data']"
22624980,miR-34a is downregulated in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum treated sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma patients with poor prognosis.,"For the purpose of analyzing mechanisms related to the cis-diamminedichloroplatinum resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we analyzed RPMI2650 and its derived previously established cis-diamminedichloroplatinum resistant cell line RPMI2650CR. To identify resistant phenotype-related microRNAs, we compared microRNA expressions between RPMI2650CR and RPMI2650 by microarray. One of the microRNAs as downregulated, miR-34a, was further investigated. Decreased expression of miR-34a in RPMI2650CR was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but introduction of the miR-34a precursor into RPMI2650CR or the inhibitor of miR-34a into RPMI2650 did not change cis-diamminedichloroplatinum sensitivities. However, 24 patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas treated with intra-arterial infusion of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum showed a significant association between decreased expression of miR-34a and poor disease specific survival (P = 0.0015), poor disease free survival (P = 0.0019), and poor local control rates (P = 0.017) (median follow-up period: 53 months). Furthermore, multivariate analyses demonstrated significant associations between miR-34a expression and the hazard ratios of disease free survival at 0.005 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.29, P = 0.011) and local control rate at 0.008 (95% CI 0.00-0.44, P = 0.019), although other parameters such as age, gender, treatment method, T and N stages did not show any similar association. These results strongly suggest that miR-34a expression can be an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma who are undergoing treatment with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Plant biology', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis']"
22195968,The little elongation complex (LEC) regulates small nuclear RNA transcription,"Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) participates in the super elongation complex (SEC) with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) CTD kinase P-TEFb. SEC is a key regulator in the expression of HOX genes in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-based hematological malignancies, in the control of induced gene expression early in development, and in immediate early gene transcription. Here, we identify an SEC-like complex in Drosophila, as well as a distinct ELL-containing complex that lacks P-TEFb and other components of SEC named the ""little elongation complex"" (LEC). LEC subunits are highly enriched at RNA Pol II-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and the loss of LEC results in decreased snRNA expression in both flies and mammals. The specialization of the SEC and LEC complexes for mRNA and snRNA-containing genes, respectively, suggests the presence of specific classes of elongation factors for each class of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II.","['Animals', 'Drosophila', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'protein', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA-Seq', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
22067385,Expression data from macrophage maturation and polarization c-Myc in alternative macrophage activation experiments,"In response to microenvironmental signals, macrophages undergo different activation, including the ""classic"" proinflammatory phenotype (also called M1), the ""alternative"" activation induced by the IL-4/IL-13 trigger, and the related but distinct heterogeneous M2 polarization associated with the anti-inflammatory profile. The latter is induced by several stimuli, including IL-10 and TGF-β. Macrophage-polarized activation has profound effects on immune and inflammatory responses and in tumor biology, but information on the underlying molecular pathways is scarce. In the present study, we report that alternative polarization of macrophages requires the transcription factor c-MYC. In macrophages, IL-4 and different stimuli sustaining M2-like polarization induce c-MYC expression and its translocation to the nucleus. c-MYC controls the induction of a subset (45%) of genes associated with alternative activation. ChIP assays indicate that c-MYC directly regulates some genes associated with alternative activation, including SCARB1, ALOX15, and MRC1, whereas others, including CD209, are indirectly regulated by c-MYC. c-MYC up-regulates the IL-4 signaling mediators signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ, is also expressed in tumor-associated macrophages, and its inhibition blocks the expression of protumoral genes including VEGF, MMP9, HIF-1α, and TGF-β. We conclude that c-MYC is a key player in alternative macrophage activation, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target in pathologies related to these cells, including tumors.","['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Colon/metabolism/pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PPAR gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']","['Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Color', 'Ecology', 'Oncology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Gamma diversity data', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

The CD34(+)CD38(-) cells, isolated from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), were shown to be enriched leukemic stem cells (LSC). We isolated the CD34(+)CD38(-) cell fraction from AML and compared their gene expression profiles to the CD34(+)CD38(+) cell fraction, using microarrays. We found 409 genes that were at least twofold over- or underexpressed between the two cell populations. These include underexpression of DNA repair, signal transduction and cell cycle genes, consistent with the relative quiescence of stem cells, and chromosomal aberrations and mutations of leukemic cells. Comparison of the LSC expression data to that of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) revealed that 34% of the modulated genes are shared by both LSC and HSC, supporting the suggestion that the LSC originated within the HSC progenitors. We focused on the Notch pathway since Jagged-2, a Notch ligand was found to be overexpressed in the LSC samples. We show that DAPT, an inhibitor of gamma-secretase, a protease that is involved in Jagged and Notch signaling, inhibits LSC growth in colony formation assays.

19417177,"Neurotoxicogenomic investigations to assess mechanisms of action of the munitions constituents RDX and 2,6-DNT in Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) (part 6 of 10)","Munitions constituents (MCs) including hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and TNT derivatives are recognized to elicit aberrant neuromuscular responses in many species. The onset of seizures resulting in death was observed in the avian model Northern bobwhite after oral dosing with RDX beginning at 8 mg/kg/day in subacute (14 days) exposures, whereas affective doses of the TNT derivative, 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), caused gastrointestinal impacts, lethargy, and emaciation in subacute and subchronic (60 days) exposures. To assess and contrast the potential neurotoxicogenomic effects of these MCs, a Northern bobwhite microarray was developed consisting of 4119 complementary DNA (cDNA) features enriched for differentially-expressed brain transcripts from exposures to RDX and 2,6-DNT. RDX affected hundreds of genes in brain tissue, whereas 2,6-DNT affected few (<or= 17), indicating that 2,6-DNT exposure had relatively little impact on the brain in comparison to RDX. Birds exhibiting RDX-induced seizures accumulated over 20x more RDX in brain tissues in comparison to non-seizing birds even within a common dose. In parallel, expression patterns were unrelated among seizing and non-seizing birds exposed to equivalent RDX doses. In birds experiencing seizures, genes related to neuronal electrophysiology and signal transduction were significantly affected. Comparative toxicology revealed strong similarity in acute exposure effects between RDX and the organochlorine insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) regarding both molecular mechanisms and putative mode of action. In a manner similar to DDT, we hypothesize that RDX elicits seizures by inhibition of neuronal cell repolarization postaction potential leading to heightened neuronal excitability and seizures facilitated by multiple molecular mechanisms.","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colinus/*physiology', 'Computational Biology', 'DDT/toxicity', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dinitrobenzenes/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Explosive Agents/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Insecticides/toxicity', 'Male', 'Neurotoxins/*toxicity', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Triazines/*toxicity']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Mapping', 'Genus name', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'DNA', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'MAT', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Genetics', 'Phylogenetics', 'Toxicology']"
20859253,Hen1 analysis in zebrafish,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are germ line-specific small RNA molecules that have a function in genome defence and germ cell development. They associate with a specific class of Argonaute proteins, named Piwi, and function through an RNA interference-like mechanism. piRNAs carry a 2'-O-methyl modification at their 3' end, which is added by the Hen1 enzyme. We show that zebrafish hen1 is specifically expressed in germ cells and is essential for maintaining a female germ line, whereas it is dispensable in the testis. Hen1 protein localizes to nuage through its C-terminal domain, but is not required for nuage formation. In hen1 mutant testes, piRNAs become uridylated and adenylated. Uridylation frequency is highest on retro-transposon-derived piRNAs and is accompanied by decreased piRNA levels and mild derepression of transposon transcripts. Altogether, our data suggest the existence of a uridylation-mediated 3'-5' exonuclease activity acting on piRNAs in zebrafish germ cells, which is counteracted by nuage-bound Hen1 protein. This system discriminates between piRNA targets and is required for ovary development and fully efficient transposon silencing.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oocytes/*cytology/metabolism', ""RNA 3' End Processing/physiology"", 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroelements', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Testis/cytology/metabolism', 'Uridine/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Sequence', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Northern blot report', 'Northern blot image', 'Northern blot experiment', 'Embryo report', 'Embryology', 'Mammals', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'MAT', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence processing', 'Data handling', 'Map data processing', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA-Seq', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Protein subcellular localisation', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'URI', 'URI format', 'Fish', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains']"
22930738,Expression data from sleep deprivation experiment in mouse hippocampus,"Sleep deprivation is a common problem of considerable health and economic impact in today's society. Sleep loss is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive functions such as memory and has a high comorbidity with many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the molecular basis of the effect of sleep deprivation in the brain. In this study, we combined genome-wide and traditional molecular biological approaches to determine the cellular and molecular impacts of sleep deprivation in the mouse hippocampus, a brain area crucial for many forms of memory. Microarray analysis examining the effects of 5 h of sleep deprivation on gene expression in the mouse hippocampus found 533 genes with altered expression. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that a prominent effect of sleep deprivation was to downregulate translation, potentially mediated through components of the insulin signaling pathway such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of protein synthesis. Consistent with this analysis, sleep deprivation reduced levels of total and phosphorylated mTOR, and levels returned to baseline after 2.5 h of recovery sleep. Our findings represent the first genome-wide analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation on the mouse hippocampus, and they suggest that the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation may be mediated by reductions in protein synthesis via downregulation of mTOR. Because protein synthesis and mTOR activation are required for long-term memory formation, our study improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the memory impairments induced by sleep deprivation.","['Animals', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genomics', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Deprivation/*genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Time Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Deposition', 'Kinase name', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
22308401,Activated YAP1 stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation,"Heart growth is tightly controlled so that the heart reaches a predetermined size. Fetal heart growth occurs through cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas postnatal heart growth involves primarily physiological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The Hippo kinase cascade is an important regulator of organ growth. A major target of this kinase cascade is YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator that is inactivated by Hippo kinase activity. Here, we used both genetic gain and loss of Yap1 function to investigate its role in regulating proliferative and physiologic hypertrophic heart growth. Fetal Yap1 inactivation caused marked, lethal myocardial hypoplasia and decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas fetal activation of YAP1 stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation. Enhanced proliferation was particularly dramatic in trabecular cardiomyocytes that normally exit from the cell cycle. Remarkably, YAP1 activation was sufficient to stimulate proliferation of postnatal cardiomyocytes, both in culture and in the intact heart. A dominant negative peptide that blocked YAP1 binding to TEAD transcription factors inhibited YAP1 proliferative activity, indicating that this activity requires YAP1-TEAD interaction. Although Yap1 was a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation, it did not influence physiological hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes, because postnatal Yap1 gain or loss of function did not significantly alter cardiomyocyte size. These studies demonstrate that Yap1 is a crucial regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation, cardiac morphogenesis, and myocardial trabeculation. Activation of Yap1 in postnatal cardiomyocytes may be a useful strategy to stimulate cardiomyocyte expansion in therapeutic myocardial regeneration.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/*metabolism', 'Genes, cdc', 'Heart/*growth & development', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serine-Threonine Kinase 3', '*Signal Transduction', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Gene regulatory network analysis', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Cardiology', 'Cardinality', 'mega', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Kinase name', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Proteins', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein signature']"
22693456,GLD-1 mRNA regulation,"Translational repression is often accompanied by mRNA degradation. In contrast, many mRNAs in germ cells and neurons are ""stored"" in the cytoplasm in a repressed but stable form. Unlike repression, the stabilization of these mRNAs is surprisingly little understood. A key player in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell development is the STAR domain protein GLD-1. By genome-wide analysis of mRNA regulation in the germ line, we observed that GLD-1 has a widespread role in repressing translation but, importantly, also in stabilizing a sub-population of its mRNA targets. Additionally, these mRNAs appear to be stabilized by the DDX6-like RNA helicase CGH-1, which is a conserved component of germ granules and processing bodies. Because many GLD-1 and CGH-1 stabilized mRNAs encode factors important for the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), our findings suggest that the regulation by GLD-1 and CGH-1 serves two purposes. Firstly, GLD-1-dependent repression prevents precocious translation of OET-promoting mRNAs. Secondly, GLD-1- and CGH-1-dependent stabilization ensures that these mRNAs are sufficiently abundant for robust translation when activated during OET. In the absence of this protective mechanism, the accumulation of OET-promoting mRNAs, and consequently the oocyte-to-embryo transition, might be compromised.","['Animals', '*Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/growth & development', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/genetics/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Germ Cells/growth & development/metabolism', 'Oocytes/growth & development/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Stability', '*RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger, Stored/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'protein', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'cel', 'Keyword', 'CellML', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'pure nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna']"
20978140,Coeevolution of a transcriptional network by compensatory trans and cis mutations,"Transcriptional networks have been shown to evolve very rapidly, prompting questions as to how such changes arise and are tolerated. Recent comparisons of transcriptional networks across species have implicated variations in the cis-acting DNA sequences near genes as the main cause of divergence. What is less clear is how these changes interact with trans-acting changes occurring elsewhere in the genetic circuit. Here, we report the discovery of a system of compensatory trans and cis mutations in the yeast AP-1 transcriptional network that allows for conserved transcriptional regulation despite continued genetic change. We pinpoint a single species, the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata, in which a trans mutation has occurred very recently in a single AP-1 family member, distinguishing it from its Saccharomyces ortholog. Comparison of chromatin immunoprecipitation profiles between Candida and Saccharomyces shows that, despite their different DNA-binding domains, the AP-1 orthologs regulate a conserved block of genes. This conservation is enabled by concomitant changes in the cis-regulatory motifs upstream of each gene. Thus, both trans and cis mutations have perturbed the yeast AP-1 regulatory system in such a way as to compensate for one another. This demonstrates an example of ""coevolution"" between a DNA-binding transcription factor and its cis-regulatory site, reminiscent of the coevolution of protein binding partners.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Candida glabrata/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*genetics/metabolism']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database name', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Microarray image', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Apart from these general tasks, topo II participates in more specialized functions. In mammals, topo IIα interacts with specific RNA polymerases and chromatin-remodeling complexes, whereas topo IIβ regulates developmental genes in conjunction with chromatin remodeling and heterochromatin transitions. Here we show that in budding yeast, topo II regulates the expression of specific gene subsets. To uncover this, we carried out a genomic transcription run-on shortly after the thermal inactivation of topo II. We identified a modest number of genes not involved in the general stress response but strictly dependent on topo II. These genes present distinctive functional and structural traits in comparison with the genome average. Yeast topo II is a positive regulator of genes with well-defined promoter architecture that associates to chromatin remodeling complexes; it is a negative regulator of genes extremely hypo-acetylated with complex promoters and undefined nucleosome positioning, many of which are involved in polyamine transport. These findings indicate that yeast topo II operates on singular chromatin architectures to activate or repress DNA transcription and that this activity produces functional responses to ensure chromatin stability.","['Chromatin/*chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA, Fungal/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleosomes/chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

In this study, we used microarrays for the first joint profiling and analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs expression in brain cortex from AD and age-matched control subjects. These data provided the unique opportunity to study the relationship between miRNA and mRNA expression in normal and AD brains. Using a non-parametric analysis, we showed that the levels of many miRNAs can be either positively or negatively correlated with those of their target mRNAs. Comparative analysis with independent cancer datasets showed that such miRNA-mRNA expression correlations are not static, but rather context-dependent. Subsequently, we identified a large set of miRNA-mRNA associations that are changed in AD versus control, highlighting AD-specific changes in the miRNA regulatory system. Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between the levels of miRNAs and those of their targets in the brain.

Four of the five Wilms cell lines had a stable normal karyotype for at least 25 passages, and four lines showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11p due to mitotic recombination in 11p11. Gene expression profiling revealed that the WT cell lines are highly similar to human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and FACS analysis demonstrated the expression of MSC-specific surface proteins CD105, CD90 and CD73. The stem cell like nature of the WT cells is further supported by their adipogenic, chondrogenic, osteogenic and myogenic differentiation potentials. By generating multipotent mesenchymal precursors from paraxial mesoderm (PAM) in tissue culture using embryonal stem cells, gene expression profiles of PAM and MSCs were described. Using these published gene sets, we found coexpression of a large number of genes in WT cell lines, PAM and MSCs. Lineage plasticity is indicated by the simultaneous expression of genes from the mesendodermal and neuroectodermal lineages. We conclude that WTs with WT1 mutations have specific traits of PAM, which is the source of kidney stromal cells.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*cytology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Cytometry', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Protein geometry data', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Genotyping', 'Genotyping experiment', 'Eukaryotes', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Exonic splicing enhancer prediction', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Keyword', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Beta diversity data']"
20525007,Effect of deuterium oxide on Arabidopsis gene expression,"Rapid environmental responses in plants rely on endogenous signaling mechanisms, which in many cases are mediated by changes in protein turnover rates. It is therefore necessary to develop methods for measuring protein dynamics that monitor large sets of plant proteins to begin to apply a systems biology approach to the study of plant behavior. The use of stable isotope labeling strategies that are adaptable to proteomic methods is particularly attractive for this purpose. Here, we explore one example of such methods that is particularly suitable for plants at the seedling stage, where measurement of amino acid and protein turnover rates is accomplished using a heavy water labeling strategy. The method is backed by microarray evaluation to define its feasibility for specific experimental approaches, and the CULLIN-ASSOCIATED AND NEDDYLATION DISSOCIATED 1 (CAND1) and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1) proteins are used to illustrate the potential utility in understanding hormonal signaling regulation. These studies provide insight not only into the potential utility of the method, but also address possible areas of concern regarding the use of heavy water labeling during plant growth. These considerations suggest a prescription for specific experimental designs that minimize interference resulting from the induction of treatment-specific gene expression in the results obtained.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Arabidopsis/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Deuterium Oxide/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/drug effects', 'Indoleacetic Acids/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Seedlings/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrometry data format', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Developmental biology', 'Regular expression', 'Nucleic acids', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'medline', 'PubMed XML', 'Medline UI', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction']"
20167706,Expression data from JAK1 wild-type and JAK1 mutation-positive T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Clinical trial report', 'Topic', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Kinase name', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Reaction ID', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Selection detection', 'Structural transformation matrix']"
20197395,Doxorubicin resistance in a novel in vitro model of human pleomorphic liposarcoma associated with ALT,"Soft tissue sarcomas are a diverse set of fatal human tumors where few agents have demonstrable clinical efficacy, with the standard therapeutic combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide showing only a 25% to 30% response rate in large multi-institutional trials. Although liposarcomas are the most common histologic form of adult soft tissue sarcomas, research in this area is severely hampered by the lack of experimentally tractable in vitro model systems. To this end, here we describe a novel in vitro model for human pleomorphic liposarcoma. The cell line (LS2) is derived from a pleomorphic liposarcoma that uses the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism of telomere maintenance, which may be important in modulating the response of this tumor type to DNA-damaging agents. We present detailed baseline molecular and genomic data, including genome-wide copy number and transcriptome profiles, for this model compared with its parental tumor and a panel of liposarcomas covering multiple histologies. The model has retained essentially all of the detectable alterations in copy number that are seen in the parental tumor, and shows molecular karyotypic and expression profiles consistent with pleomorphic liposarcomas. We also show the utility of this model, together with two additional human liposarcoma cell lines, to investigate the relationship between topoisomerase 2A expression and the sensitivity of ALT-positive liposarcomas to doxorubicin. This model, together with its associated baseline data, provides a powerful new tool to develop treatments for this clinically poorly tractable tumor and to investigate the contribution that ALT makes to modulating sensitivity to doxorubicin.","['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomic Instability/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism']","['Plant biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Analysis', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Genomics', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Annotation track', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Theoretical biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Mathematical modelling', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture']"
20179139,A novel S-sulfocysteine synthase essential for chloroplast function in Arabidopsis thaliana,"In bacteria, the biosynthesis of Cys is accomplished by two enzymes that are encoded by the cysK and cysM genes. CysM is also able to use thiosulfate as a substrate to produce S-sulfocysteine. In plant cells, the biosynthesis of Cys occurs in the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain two O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase homologs, which are encoded by the OAS-B and CS26 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. An in vitro enzymatic analysis of the recombinant CS26 protein demonstrated that this isoform possesses S-sulfocysteine synthase activity and lacks O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase activity. In vivo functional analysis of this enzyme in knockout mutants demonstrated that mutation of CS26 suppressed the S-sulfocysteine synthase activity that was detected in the wild type; furthermore, the cs26 mutants exhibited a reduction in size and showed paleness, but penetrance of the growth phenotype depended on the light regime. The cs26 mutant plants also had reductions in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity (neither of which were observed in oas-b mutants) as well as elevated glutathione levels. However, cs26 leaves were not able to properly detoxify reactive oxygen species, which accumulated to high levels under long-day growth conditions. The transcriptional profile of the cs26 mutant revealed that the mutation had a pleiotropic effect on many cellular and metabolic processes. Our findings reveal that S-sulfocysteine and the activity of S-sulfocysteine synthase play important roles in chloroplast function and are essential for light-dependent redox regulation within the chloroplast.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis/*enzymology', 'Chloroplasts/*metabolism', '*Light', 'Lyases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Light microscopy', 'Position weight matrix', 'Protein molecular weight calculation', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Keyword', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Gene family report']"
20064377,"Expression profiles of MDA-MB-231, MDA-231 S1a and S1b","Cancer cells that leave the primary tumor can seed metastases in distant organs, and it is thought that this is a unidirectional process. Here we show that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can also colonize their tumors of origin, in a process that we call ""tumor self-seeding."" Self-seeding of breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma tumors in mice is preferentially mediated by aggressive CTCs, including those with bone, lung, or brain-metastatic tropism. We find that the tumor-derived cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 act as CTC attractants whereas MMP1/collagenase-1 and the actin cytoskeleton component fascin-1 are mediators of CTC infiltration into mammary tumors. We show that self-seeding can accelerate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and stromal recruitment through seed-derived factors including the chemokine CXCL1. Tumor self-seeding could explain the relationships between anaplasia, tumor size, vascularity and prognosis, and local recurrence seeded by disseminated cells following ostensibly complete tumor excision.","['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'ELAND format', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Local alignment', 'Local structure alignment', 'Plasmid map', 'Model organisms', 'DNA testing', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis', 'Sequence masking']"
20360305,Transcriptome Analysis and Molecular Signature of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a polarized cell layer critical for photoreceptor function and survival. The unique physiology and relationship to the photoreceptors make the RPE a critical determinant of human vision. Therefore, we performed a global expression profiling of native and cultured human fetal and adult RPE and determined a set of highly expressed 'signature' genes by comparing the observed RPE gene profiles to the Novartis expression database (SymAtlas: http://wombat.gnf.org/index.html) of 78 tissues. Using stringent selection criteria of at least 10-fold higher expression in three distinct preparations, we identified 154 RPE signature genes, which were validated by qRT-PCR analysis in RPE and in an independent set of 11 tissues. Several of the highly expressed signature genes encode proteins involved in visual cycle, melanogenesis and cell adhesion and Gene ontology analysis enabled the assignment of RPE signature genes to epithelial channels and transporters (ClCN4, BEST1, SLCA20) or matrix remodeling (TIMP3, COL8A2). Fifteen RPE signature genes were associated with known ophthalmic diseases, and 25 others were mapped to regions of disease loci. An evaluation of the RPE signature genes in a recently completed AMD genomewide association (GWA) data set revealed that TIMP3, GRAMD3, PITPNA and CHRNA3 signature genes may have potential roles in AMD pathogenesis and deserve further examination. We propose that RPE signature genes are excellent candidates for retinal diseases and for physiological investigations (e.g. dopachrome tautomerase in melanogenesis). The RPE signature gene set should allow the validation of RPE-like cells derived from human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells for cell-based therapies of degenerative retinal diseases.","['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/genetics', 'Macular Degeneration/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/cytology/embryology/*metabolism']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular interaction ID', 'Molecular data', 'Protein interaction format', 'Generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence generation', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis']"
21131358,Effects of retinoids on estrogen-receptor-positive and -negative breast carcinoma cells: mRNA and miRNA profiling,"Retinoids are promising agents for the treatment/prevention of breast carcinoma. We examined the role of microRNAs in mediating the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which suppresses the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive (ERα(+)) breast carcinoma cells, such as MCF-7, but not estrogen receptor-negative cells, such as MDA-MB-231. We found that pro-oncogenic miR-21 is selectively induced by ATRA in ERα(+) cells. Induction of miR-21 counteracts the anti-proliferative action of ATRA but has the potentially beneficial effect of reducing cell motility. In ERα(+) cells, retinoid-dependent induction of miR-21 is due to increased transcription of the MIR21 gene via ligand-dependent activation of the nuclear retinoid receptor, RARα. RARα is part of the transcription complex present in the 5'-flanking region of the MIR21 gene. The receptor binds to two functional retinoic acid-responsive elements mapping upstream of the transcription initiation site. Silencing of miR-21 enhances ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and senescence while reverting suppression of cell motility afforded by the retinoid. Up-regulation of miR-21 results in retinoid-dependent inhibition of the established target, maspin. Knockdown and overexpression of maspin in MCF-7 cells indicates that the protein is involved in ATRA-induced growth inhibition and contributes to the ATRA-dependent anti-motility responses. Integration between whole genome analysis of genes differentially regulated by ATRA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, prediction of miR-21 regulated genes, and functional studies led to the identification of three novel direct miR-21 targets: the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B, the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and PLAT, the tissue-type plasminogen activator. Evidence for ICAM-1 involvement in retinoid-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell motility is provided.","['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']","['BEAST', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular interaction ID', 'Protein interaction format', 'Molecular interaction analysis', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Protein interaction ID', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Biobank', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Plasmid map', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Tree dating']"

This anticipatory behavior is important to the fitness of diverse species, and in context of the diurnal cycle it is overall typical of eukaryotes and some photoautotrophic bacteria but is yet to be observed in archaea. Here, we report the first observation of light-dark (LD)-entrained diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12% of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the LD stimulus (free-running rhythms). The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the LD cycle. Our results suggest that under nutrient limited conditions halophilic archaea take advantage of the causal influence of sunlight (via temperature) on O(2) diffusivity in a closed hypersaline environment to streamline their physiology and operate oxically during nighttime and anoxically during daytime.","['*Circadian Rhythm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Archaeal/drug effects', 'Genes, Archaeal', 'Halobacterium salinarum/drug effects/genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Oxygen/pharmacology']","['Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Prokaryotes and Archaea', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'GEN']"
20460524,Expression data from TKI258 treated 4T1 cells,"Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family have essential roles in normal physiology and in cancer where they control diverse processes. FGFRs have been associated with breast cancer development. Thus, models to study the role of FGFR in breast cancer and their targeting potential are important. We present an in vitro and in vivo analysis of FGFRs in the breast cancer model cell lines 67NR and 4T1. We show that both tumor cell lines coexpress FGFRs and ligands and display autocrine FGFR signaling activity. Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), a downstream mediator of FGFR, is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and multiple signaling pathways are active. Treatment of 67NR and 4T1 cultures with TKI258, an FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), caused a rapid decrease in FRS2 phosphorylation; decreased the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), AKT, and phospholipase Cgamma; and blocked proliferation of both tumor lines. Furthermore, TKI258 induced 4T1 apoptotic cell death via blockade of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, one dose of TKI258 rapidly lowered FRS2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 and AKT activity in mammary tumors. Long-term TKI258 treatment of 4T1 tumor- and 67NR tumor-bearing mice had a significant effect on primary tumor outgrowth and 4T1 tumor-induced lung metastases. A microarray analysis was carried out to identify targets with roles in TKI258 antitumor activity and potential prognostic markers in human breast tumors.

Persistent replication stresses normally induce p53-mediated senescence or apoptosis to prevent tumour progression. It is unclear how some mutant cells can overcome persistent replication stresses and bypass the p53-mediated pathways to develop malignancy. Here we show that polyploidy, which is often observed in human cancers, leads to overexpression of BRCA1, p19arf and other DNA repair genes in FEN1 mutant cells. This overexpression triggers SSB repair and non-homologous end-joining pathways to increase DNA repair activity, but at the cost of frequent chromosomal translocations. Meanwhile, DNA methylation silences p53 target genes to bypass the p53-mediated senescence and apoptosis. These molecular changes rewire DNA damage response and repair gene networks in polyploid tumour cells, enabling them to escape replication stress-induced senescence barriers.","['Animals', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA Replication', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Polyploidy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Single particle analysis', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'Image', 'DNA', 'dna', 'pair', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'PolyA signal detection', 'protein', 'Tumor annotation', 'Protein expression']"

To investigate the transcriptional regulation provided by this axis, we performed the first differential transcriptome profiling of human cord blood CD34(+) cells in response to short-term exposure to SDF-1 and identified a panel of genes with putative homing functions. We demonstrated that CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, was expressed in CD34(+)CD38(-/lo) and CD34(+)CD38(+) cells. CD9 levels were enhanced by SDF-1, which simultaneously down-regulated CXCR4 membrane expression. Using specific inhibitors and activators, we demonstrated that CD9 expression was modulated via CXCR4, G-protein, protein kinase C, phospholipase C, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Janus kinase 2 signals. Pretreatment of CD34(+) cells with the anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody ALB6 significantly inhibited SDF-1-mediated transendothelial migration and calcium mobilization, whereas adhesion to fibronectin and endothelial cells was enhanced. Pretreatment of CD34(+) cells with ALB6 significantly impaired their homing to bone marrow and spleen of sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient) mice. Sorted CD34(+)CD9(-) cells displayed lower bone marrow homing capacity compared with that of total CD34(+) cells. CD9 expression on homed CD34(+) cells was significantly up-regulated in vivo.

20519643,Expression data from effector CD4 T cells isolated from MRL/Faslpr mice.,"Follicular helper T (T(FH)) cells, defined by expression of the surface markers CXCR5 and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and synthesis of IL-21, require upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 for their development and function in B cell maturation in germinal centers. We have explored the role of B cells and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-21 in the in vivo regulation of Bcl6 expression and T(FH) cell development. We found that T(FH) cells are characterized by a Bcl6-dependent downregulation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1, a CCL19- and CCL21-binding protein), indicating that, like CXCR5 and PD-1 upregulation, modulation of PSGL1 expression is part of the T(FH) cell program of differentiation. B cells were neither required for initial upregulation of Bcl6 nor PSGL1 downregulation, suggesting these events preceded T-B cell interactions, although they were required for full development of the T(FH) cell phenotype, including CXCR5 and PD-1 upregulation, and IL-21 synthesis. Bcl6 upregulation and T(FH) cell differentiation were independent of IL-6 and IL-21, revealing that either cytokine is not absolutely required for development of Bcl6(+) T(FH) cells in vivo. These data increase our understanding of Bcl6 regulation in T(FH) cells and their differentiation in vivo and identifies a new surface marker that may be functionally relevant in this subset.","['Animals', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Spleen/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Infectious disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Cell line report', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Genotyping', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Operation', 'Generation', 'Data handling', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Transcription', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'GEN', 'Feature selection']"
21646717,Gene profile of PTIP deletion in adult murine cardiac tissue,"Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) methyltransferases and their cofactors are essential for embryonic development and the establishment of gene expression patterns in a cell-specific and heritable manner. However, the importance of such epigenetic marks in maintaining gene expression in adults and in initiating human disease is unclear. Here, we addressed this question using a mouse model in which we could inducibly ablate PAX interacting (with transcription-activation domain) protein 1 (PTIP), a key component of the H3K4me complex, in cardiac cells. Reducing H3K4me3 marks in differentiated cardiomyocytes was sufficient to alter gene expression profiles. One gene regulated by H3K4me3 was Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (Kcnip2), which regulates a cardiac repolarization current that is downregulated in heart failure and functions in arrhythmogenesis. This regulation led to a decreased sodium current and action potential upstroke velocity and significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD). The prolonged APD augmented intracellular calcium and in vivo systolic heart function. Treatment with isoproterenol and caffeine in this mouse model resulted in the generation of premature ventricular beats, a harbinger of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. These results suggest that the maintenance of H3K4me3 marks is necessary for the stability of a transcriptional program in differentiated cells and point to an essential function for H3K4me3 epigenetic marks in cellular homeostasis.","['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kv Channel-Interacting Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ventricular Premature Complexes']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Calculation', 'Spectrum calculation', 'Linkage disequilibrium calculation', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Analysis', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Protein domains', 'Protein complex', 'Sequence complexity calculation', 'Protein ID (CORUM)']"

We evaluated the effect of the small molecule TNF inhibitor LMP-420 on primary CLL cells. The mean concentration of LMP-420 required to induce 50% cytotoxicity (ED50) at 72 h was 245 n. LMP-420-induced time- and dose-dependent apoptosis, as shown by annexin V staining, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. These changes were associated with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. CLL cells from patients with poor prognostic indicators showed LMP-420 sensitivity equal to that for cells from patients with favorable characteristics. In addition, LMP-420 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of fludarabine and inhibited in vitro proliferation of stimulated CLL cells. Gene expression profiling indicated that the mechanism of action of LMP-420 may involve suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB and immune response pathways in CLL cells. LMP-420 had minimal effects on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell, B- and T-cell function, and hematopoietic colony formation. Our data suggest that LMP-420 may be a useful treatment for CLL with negligible hematologic toxicities.","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boron Compounds/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Purines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']","['Plant biology', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound name', 'Compound accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug report', 'Drug metabolism', 'Drug name', 'Cytometry', 'Protein geometry data', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'pure', 'pure protein', 'pure rna', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
20593031,"Affymetrix SNP array for CSES1, CSES8, CSES1 maternal, and CSES8 maternal","X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage compensation mechanism essential for embryonic development and cell physiology. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocyst stage embryos have been used as a model system to understand XCI initiation and maintenance. Previous studies of undifferentiated female hESCs at intermediate passages have shown three possible states of XCI; 1) cells in a pre-XCI state, 2) cells that already exhibit XCI, or 3) cells that never undergo XCI even upon differentiation. In this study, XCI status was assayed in ten female hESC lines between passage 5 and 15 to determine whether XCI variations occur in early passages of hESCs. Our results show that three different states of XCI already exist in the early passages of hESC. In addition, we observe one cell line with skewed XCI and preferential expression of X-linked genes from the paternal allele, while another cell line exhibits random XCI. Skewed XCI in undifferentiated hESCs may be due to clonal selection in culture instead of non-random XCI in ICM cells. We also found that XIST promoter methylation is correlated with silencing of XIST transcripts in early passages of hESCs, even in the pre-XCI state. In conclusion, XCI variations already take place in early passages of hESCs, which may be a consequence of in vitro culture selection during the derivation process. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that XCI variations in hESCs may reflect heterogeneous XCI states in ICM cells that stochastically give rise to hESCs.","['Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, X', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics', '*X Chromosome Inactivation']","['Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Genetic map', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'Coding region', 'DNA translation', 'Translational medicine', 'RNA', 'Chromosome name']"

The regulation of these Ca(2+) signals and their correlation to the biological function of each T cell subset remains unclear. Trpm4 is a Ca(2+)-activated cation channel that we found is expressed at higher levels in Th2 cells compared with Th1 cells. Inhibition of Trpm4 expression increased Ca(2+) influx and oscillatory levels in Th2 cells and decreased influx and oscillations in Th1 cells. This inhibition of Trpm4 expression also significantly altered T cell cytokine production and motility. Our experiments revealed that decreasing Trpm4 levels divergently regulates nuclear localization of NFATc1. Consistent with this, gene profiling did not show Trpm4-dependent transcriptional regulation, and T-bet and GATA-3 levels remain identical. Thus, Trpm4 is expressed at different levels in Th cells and plays a distinctive role in T cell function by differentially regulating Ca(2+) signaling and NFATc1 localization.","['Animals', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/genetics/*immunology', 'Cations, Divalent/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Migration Inhibition/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Movement/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics/immunology', 'TRPM Cation Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Calculation', 'Spectrum calculation', 'Linkage disequilibrium calculation', 'Signaling pathways', 'Signaling Gateway protein ID', 'Protein binding site signature', 'Protein non-covalent interactions report', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Mutation annotation (prevalence)', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell migration track image', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein report', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'cel', 'CellML']"
22150075,Tomato fruit wound inoculation by C. coccodes and ammonium treated,"The postharvest pathogens Colletotrichum coccodes remains quiescent after infection of unripe fruit. However, during fruit ripening, the pathogen assumes a necrotrophic life style, rapidly colonizing the tissue. C. coccodes secretes ammonium during germination and colonization of host tissue that induces host programmed cell death. We further examined the role of ammonia in the infection process by analyzing transcriptome expression from infected and ammonia-treated fruit tissue compared with healthy tissue. The analysis revealed 82 and 237 common upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of select transcripts in normal and transgenic NADPH oxidase antisense plants revealed that their expression was NADPH oxidase dependent. Common-upregulated genes showed overrepresentation of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent genes as well as genes related to biotic stress. The downregulated genes showed overrepresentation of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent genes. Indeed, direct application of SA to the fruit enhanced C. coccodes necrotrophic colonization, whereas the application of JA delayed colonization. Importantly, green fruit and red fruit displayed similar gene expression patterns although only red fruit is susceptible to colonization. Thus, it is likely that the resistance of green fruit to C. coccodes colonization is due to additional factors.","['Ammonia/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Colletotrichum/drug effects/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fruit/growth & development/microbiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/drug effects', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Solanum lycopersicum/*drug effects/genetics/microbiology', 'Mutation', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxylipins/pharmacology', 'Plant Diseases/*genetics/microbiology', 'Plant Growth Regulators/pharmacology', 'Plant Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*metabolism', 'RNA, Plant/genetics', 'Salicylic Acid/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Virulence/drug effects']","['Data acquisition', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Proteins', 'PHYLIP format', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Regulatory affairs', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Genetic engineering', 'Plant biology', 'Genetics', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound name', 'Protein quaternary structure prediction', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"

Women with operable early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a multicenter study of neoadjuvant therapy for four 21-day cycles with capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) plus docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) if human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, and additionally, a standard trastuzumab dose if HER2-positive. Primary endpoint was rate of pCR and npCR. Secondary endpoints were potential associations between response and TP53 mutational analysis using the AmpliChip TP53 assay or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and genomic subtyping using the PAM50 assay. In patients who completed treatment and surgery, pCR and npCR rates were 15.8% in patients with HER2-negative and 50% in patients with HER2-positive tumors. Stratified by genomic subtype, patients of HER2-enriched subtype had the best response (72.2%), and luminal A (9.1%) and B (4.8%) subtypes, the poorest. Of 147 patients tested for TP53 mutations using the AmpliChip assay, 78 variants were detected; 55 were missense. Response rate among TP53-mutated patients was 30%, significantly higher than TP53 wild-type patients (10%; P = 0.0032). Concordance between AmpliChip mutation status versus TP53 IHC staining was 65%, with AmpliChip status predictive of response and IHC status not predictive.

20667913,"Drosophila Pph13 mutant vs. wildtype and Orthodenticle, Pph13 double mutant vs. wildtype","The function and integrity of photoreceptor cells are dependent upon the creation and maintenance of specialized apical structures: membrane discs/outer segments in vertebrates and rhabdomeres in insects. We performed a molecular and morphological comparison of Drosophila Pph13 and orthodenticle (otd) mutants to investigate the transcriptional network controlling the late stages of rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell development and function. Although Otd and Pph13 have been implicated in rhabdomere morphogenesis, we demonstrate that it is necessary to remove both factors to completely eliminate rhabdomere formation. Rhabdomere absence is not the result of degeneration or a failure of initiation, but rather the inability of the apical membrane to transform and elaborate into a rhabdomere. Transcriptional profiling revealed that Pph13 plays an integral role in promoting rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell function. Pph13 regulates Rh2 and Rh6, and other phototransduction genes, demonstrating that Pph13 and Otd control a distinct subset of Rhodopsin-encoding genes in adult visual systems. Bioinformatic, DNA binding and transcriptional reporter assays showed that Pph13 can bind and activate transcription via a perfect Pax6 homeodomain palindromic binding site and the Rhodopsin core sequence I (RCSI) found upstream of Drosophila Rhodopsin genes. In vivo studies indicate that Pph13 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the expression of a multimerized RCSI reporter, a marker of photoreceptor cell specificity previously suggested to be regulated by Pax6. Our studies define a key transcriptional regulatory pathway that is necessary for late Drosophila photoreceptor development and will serve as a basis for better understanding rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell development and function.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/*growth & development/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Insect', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mutation', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate/*cytology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rhodopsin/genetics/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Protein modification ID', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Electron microscopy', 'Electron microscopy model', 'Electron microscopy model ID', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Invertebrates', 'Vertebrates', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Arabidopsis']"
20713445,Transcriptional Mediator Subunit MED1/TRAP220 in Stromal Cells Is Involved in Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell Support through Osteopontin Expression,"MED1/TRAP220, a subunit of the transcriptional Mediator/TRAP complex, is crucial for various biological events through its interaction with distinct activators, such as nuclear receptors and GATA family activators. In hematopoiesis, MED1 plays a pivotal role in optimal nuclear receptor-mediated myelomonopoiesis and GATA-1-induced erythropoiesis. In this study, we present evidence that MED1 in stromal cells is involved in supporting hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells (HSPCs) through osteopontin (OPN) expression. We found that the proliferation of bone marrow (BM) cells cocultured with MED1 knockout (Med1(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was significantly suppressed compared to the control. Furthermore, the number of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) was attenuated for BM cells cocultured with Med1(-/-) MEFs. The vitamin D receptor (VDR)- and Runx2-mediated expression of OPN, as well as Mediator recruitment to the Opn promoter, was specifically attenuated in the Med1(-/-) MEFs. Addition of OPN to these MEFs restored the growth of cocultured BM cells and the number of LTC-ICs, both of which were attenuated by the addition of the anti-OPN antibody to Med1(+/+) MEFs and to BM stromal cells. Consequently, MED1 in niche appears to play an important role in supporting HSPCs by upregulating VDR- and Runx2-mediated transcription on the Opn promoter.","['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mediator Complex Subunit 1/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteopontin/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Cell culture collection', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Complementary medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Recombination detection', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'cel', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Selection detection', 'Transcription', 'Hybrid sequence alignment', 'System metadata']"
30115935,GEMINI (Gastric Encyclopedia of Molecular Interactions and Nodes for Intervention) : 37 unique Gastric cancer cell lines,"Exportin-1 (XPO1) controls the nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of several key growth regulatory and tumor suppressor proteins. Nuclear export blockade through XPO1 inhibition is a target for therapeutic inhibition in many cancers. Studies have suggested XPO1 upregulation as an indicator of poor prognosis in gastric cancer. In the current study, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds KPT-185, KTP-276 and clinical stage selinexor (KPT-330) in gastric cancer. XPO1 was found to be overexpressed in gastric cancer as compared to adjacent normal tissues and was correlated with poor survival outcomes. Among the 3 SINE compounds, in vitro targeting of XPO1 with selinexor resulted in greatest potency with significant anti-proliferative effects at nano molar concentrations. XPO1 inhibition by selinexor resulted in nuclear accumulation of p53, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Also, inhibition of XPO1 lead to the cytoplasmic retention of p21 and suppression of survivin. Orally administered selienxor caused significant inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft models of gastric cancer. Furthermore, combination of selinexor with irinotecan exhibited greater anti-tumor effect compared to individual treatment. Taken together, our study underscores the therapeutic utility of XPO1 targeting in gastric cancer and suggests the potential benefits of XPO1 inhibition in-combination with chemotherapy.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Nucleic acid report', 'Transposon prediction', 'Active site prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Plant biology', 'DNA testing', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Carbohydrates', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecules', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'Protein data', 'Format', 'DNA substitution model']"
21120952,Profiling wt SOD versus ALS SOD1(G93A) mutant,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In addition, aberrant mRNA splicing has been documented in neurodegeneration. To characterize the cellular response to mitochondrial perturbations at the level of gene expression and alternative pre-mRNA splicing we used splicing-sensitive microarrays to profile human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with paraquat, a neurotoxic herbicide that induces the formation of reactive oxygen species and causes mitochondrial damage in animal models, and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the mutant G93A-SOD1 protein, one of the genetic causes of ALS. In both models we identified a common set of genes whose expression and alternative splicing are deregulated. Pathway analysis of the deregulated genes revealed enrichment in genes involved in neuritogenesis, axon growth and guidance, and synaptogenesis. Alterations in transcription and pre-mRNA splicing of candidate genes were confirmed experimentally in the cell line models as well as in brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice carrying the G93A-SOD1 mutation. Our findings expand the realm of the pathways implicated in neurodegeneration and suggest that alterations of axonal function may descend directly from mitochondrial damage.","['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Axons/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Neurites/metabolism', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Mitochondria', 'Neurite measurement', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Generation', 'Rare diseases', 'Protein ID (PeroxiBase)']"
20417597,CpG islands recruit a histone H3 lysine 36 demethylase [Agilent data],"In higher eukaryotes, up to 70% of genes have high levels of nonmethylated cytosine/guanine base pairs (CpGs) surrounding promoters and gene regulatory units. These features, called CpG islands, were identified over 20 years ago, but there remains little mechanistic evidence to suggest how these enigmatic elements contribute to promoter function, except that they are refractory to epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36-specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements results in removal of H3K36 methylation, creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modification. KDM2A utilizes a zinc finger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that preferentially recognizes nonmethylated CpG DNA, and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands. These data expose a straightforward mechanism through which KDM2A delineates a unique architecture that differentiates CpG island chromatin from bulk chromatin.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases', 'Lysine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Sequence', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'CATH domain ID', 'Analysis', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein tertiary structure', 'Protein tertiary structure prediction', 'Tertiary structure format', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination']"

21926103,Sural nerve of progressive and non-progressive diabetic neuropathy patients,"Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. While multiple pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy, there are no specific treatments and no means to predict diabetic neuropathy onset or progression. Here, we identify gene expression signatures related to diabetic neuropathy and develop computational classification models of diabetic neuropathy progression. Microarray experiments were performed on 50 samples of human sural nerves collected during a 52-week clinical trial. A series of bioinformatics analyses identified differentially expressed genes and their networks and biological pathways potentially responsible for the progression of diabetic neuropathy. We identified 532 differentially expressed genes between patient samples with progressing or non-progressing diabetic neuropathy, and found these were functionally enriched in pathways involving inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism. A literature-derived co-citation network of the differentially expressed genes revealed gene subnetworks centred on apolipoprotein E, jun, leptin, serpin peptidase inhibitor E type 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. The differentially expressed genes were used to classify a test set of patients with regard to diabetic neuropathy progression. Ridge regression models containing 14 differentially expressed genes correctly classified the progression status of 92% of patients (P < 0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify transcriptional changes associated with diabetic neuropathy progression in human sural nerve biopsies and describe their potential utility in classifying diabetic neuropathy. Our results identifying the unique gene signature of patients with progressive diabetic neuropathy will facilitate the development of new mechanism-based diagnostics and therapies.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diabetic Neuropathies/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', '*Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sural Nerve/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Up-Regulation']","['Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Structural data', '3D profile generation', 'Protein structural motifs and surfaces']"
21991358,miRNA profiling during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells based on two different miRNA array platforms,"MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a critical role in a wide variety of biological processes. Profiling miRNA expression during differentiation of embryonic stem cells will help to understand the regulation pathway of differentiation, which in turn may elucidate disease mechanisms. The identified miRNAs could then serve as a new group of possible therapeutic targets. In the present paper, miRNA expression profiles were determined during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation and maturation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. For this purpose a homogeneous cardiomyocyte population was generated from a transgenic murine ES cell line. Two high throughput array platforms (Affymetrix and Febit) were used for miRNA profiling in order to compare the effect of the platforms on miRNA profiling as well as to increase the validity of target miRNA identification. Four time points (i.e. day 0, day 12, day 19 and day 26) were chosen for the miRNA profiling study, which corresponded to different stages during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation and maturation. Fifty platform and pre-processing method-independent miRNAs were identified as being regulated during the differentiation and maturation processes. The identification of these miRNAs is an important step for characterizing and understanding the events involved in cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation of ES cells and may also highlight candidate target molecules for therapeutic purposes.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heart/embryology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics as Topic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Analysis', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Cardinality', 'Cardiology', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Read mapping', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Essential dynamics', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Nc statistic', 'Topic', 'Statistical calculation']"
21311097,A molecular signature of normal breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome mutation carriers,"Specific changes in gene expression during cancer initiation should enable discovery of biomarkers for risk assessment, early detection and targets for chemoprevention. It has been previously demonstrated that altered mRNA and proteome signatures of morphologically normal cells bearing a single inherited ""hit"" in a tumor suppressor gene parallel many changes observed in the corresponding sporadic cancer. Here, we report on the global gene expression profile of morphologically normal, cultured primary breast epithelial and stromal cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) TP53 mutation carriers. Our analyses identified multiple changes in gene expression in both morphologically normal breast epithelial and stromal cells associated with TP53 haploinsufficiency, as well as interlocking pathways. Notably, a dysregulated p53 signaling pathway was readily detectable. Pharmacological intervention with the p53 rescue compounds CP-31398 and PRIMA-1 provided further evidence in support of the central role of p53 in affecting these changes in LFS cells and treatment for this cancer. Because loss of signaling mediated by TP53 is associated with the development and survival of many human tumors, identification of gene expression profiles in morphologically normal cells that carry ""one-hit"" p53 mutations may reveal novel biomarkers, enabling the discovery of potential targets for chemoprevention of sporadic tumors as well.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aza Compounds/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/genetics/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']","['Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Compound identifier', 'Compound name', 'Compound accession', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Compound ID (BioCyc)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Proline mutation value calculation', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'cel', 'Protein expression']"

The 16S ribosomal DNA sequence of the isolate (strain JS666) had 97.9% identity to the sequence from Polaromonas vacuolata, indicating that the isolate was a beta-proteobacterium. At 20 degrees C, strain JS666 grew on cDCE with a minimum doubling time of 73 +/- 7 h and a growth yield of 6.1 g of protein/mol of cDCE. Chloride analysis indicated that complete dechlorination of cDCE occurred during growth. The half-velocity constant for cDCE transformation was 1.6 +/- 0.2 microM, and the maximum specific substrate utilization rate ranged from 12.6 to 16.8 nmol/min/mg of protein. Resting cells grown on cDCE could transform cDCE, ethene, vinyl chloride, trans-dichloroethene, trichloroethene, and 1,2-dichloroethane. Epoxyethane was produced from ethene by cDCE-grown cells, suggesting that an epoxidation reaction is the first step in cDCE degradation.","['Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Dichloroethylenes/*metabolism', 'Proteobacteria/classification/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics']","['Environmental sciences', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'protein', 'Proteome', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamics', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamic data', 'Nucleic acid thermodynamic property calculation']"

22821013,Candidatus Carsonella ruddii HC Genome Sequencing,"Genome reduction in obligately intracellular bacteria is one of the most well-established patterns in the field of molecular evolution. In the extreme, many sap-feeding insects harbor nutritional symbionts with genomes that are so reduced that it is not clear how they perform basic cellular functions. For example, the primary symbiont of psyllids (Carsonella) maintains one of the smallest and most AT-rich bacterial genomes ever identified and has surprisingly lost many genes that are thought to be essential for its role in provisioning its host with amino acids. However, our understanding of this extreme case of genome reduction is limited, as genomic data for Carsonella are available from only a single host species, and little is known about the functional role of ""secondary"" bacterial symbionts in psyllids. To address these limitations, we analyzed complete Carsonella genomes from pairs of congeneric hosts in three divergent genera within the Psyllidae (Ctenarytaina, Heteropsylla, and Pachypsylla) as well as complete secondary symbiont genomes from two of these host species (Ctenarytaina eucalypti and Heteropsylla cubana). Although the Carsonella genomes are generally conserved in size, structure, and GC content and exhibit genome-wide signatures of purifying selection, we found that gene loss has remained active since the divergence of the host species and had a particularly large impact on the amino acid biosynthesis pathways that define the symbiotic role of Carsonella. In some cases, the presence of additional bacterial symbionts may compensate for gene loss in Carsonella, as functional gene content indicates a high degree of metabolic complementarity between co-occurring symbionts. The genomes of the secondary symbionts also show signatures of long-term evolution as vertically transmitted, intracellular bacteria, including more extensive genome reduction than typically observed in facultative symbionts. Therefore, a history of co-evolution with secondary bacterial symbionts can partially explain the ongoing genome reduction in Carsonella. However, the absence of these secondary symbionts in other host lineages indicates that the relationships are dynamic and that other mechanisms, such as changes in host diet or functional coordination with the host genome, must also be at play.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaproteobacteria/*genetics', 'Genome Size/*genetics', 'Genome, Bacterial/*genetics', 'Hemiptera/*microbiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity', '*Symbiosis']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database name', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Pathway ID (Panther)', 'Synthetic biology', 'Panther Pathways entry format', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Word size', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Rotamer likelihood prediction', 'Protein function prediction', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map', 'Sequence annotation', 'Annotation', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Sequence alignment', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"

23358723,Analysis of Chromosome VIII of EC-C1 strains (S. cerevisiae),"Large-scale genome rearrangements have been observed in cells adapting to various selective conditions during laboratory evolution experiments. However, it remains unclear whether these types of mutations can be stably maintained in populations and how they impact the evolutionary trajectories. Here we show that chromosomal rearrangements contribute to extremely high copper tolerance in a set of natural yeast strains isolated from Evolution Canyon (EC), Israel. The chromosomal rearrangements in EC strains result in segmental duplications in chromosomes 7 and 8, which increase the copy number of genes involved in copper regulation, including the crucial transcriptional activator CUP2 and the metallothionein CUP1. The copy number of CUP2 is correlated with the level of copper tolerance, indicating that increasing dosages of a single transcriptional activator by chromosomal rearrangements has a profound effect on a regulatory pathway. By gene expression analysis and functional assays, we identified three previously unknown downstream targets of CUP2: PHO84, SCM4, and CIN2, all of which contributed to copper tolerance in EC strains. Finally, we conducted an evolution experiment to examine how cells maintained these changes in a fluctuating environment. Interestingly, the rearranged chromosomes were reverted back to the wild-type configuration at a high frequency and the recovered chromosome became fixed in less selective conditions. Our results suggest that transposon-mediated chromosomal rearrangements can be highly dynamic and can serve as a reversible mechanism during early stages of adaptive evolution.","['Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*genetics', 'Copper/*toxicity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetics, Population', 'Genome, Fungal', '*Genomic Instability/drug effects/genetics', 'Israel', 'Metallothionein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proton-Phosphate Symporters/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Segmental Duplications, Genomic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosome report', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene ID', 'Gene map', 'Gene name', 'Population genetics', 'Population genomics', 'Genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Functional genomics', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Genomics', 'Statistics and probability', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Duplication detection', 'Annotation track', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

We demonstrate by genetic means that γ-secretase and RBPJ are essential for the formation of NSCLCs. Of importance, pharmacologic treatment of mice carrying autochthonous NSCLCs with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks cancer growth. Treated carcinomas present reduced HES1 levels and reduced phosphorylated ERK without changes in phosphorylated MEK. Mechanistically, we show that HES1 directly binds to and represses the promoter of DUSP1, encoding a dual phosphatase that is active against phospho-ERK. Accordingly, GSI treatment upregulates DUSP1 and decreases phospho-ERK.

19047403,Causes Q fever,"Genetically distinct isolates of Coxiella burnetii, the cause of human Q fever, display different phenotypes with respect to in vitro infectivity/cytopathology and pathogenicity for laboratory animals. Moreover, correlations between C. burnetii genomic groups and human disease presentation (acute versus chronic) have been described, suggesting that isolates have distinct virulence characteristics. To provide a more-complete understanding of C. burnetii's genetic diversity, evolution, and pathogenic potential, we deciphered the whole-genome sequences of the K (Q154) and G (Q212) human chronic endocarditis isolates and the naturally attenuated Dugway (5J108-111) rodent isolate. Cross-genome comparisons that included the previously sequenced Nine Mile (NM) reference isolate (RSA493) revealed both novel gene content and disparate collections of pseudogenes that may contribute to isolate virulence and other phenotypes. While C. burnetii genomes are highly syntenous, recombination between abundant insertion sequence (IS) elements has resulted in genome plasticity manifested as chromosomal rearrangement of syntenic blocks and DNA insertions/deletions. The numerous IS elements, genomic rearrangements, and pseudogenes of C. burnetii isolates are consistent with genome structures of other bacterial pathogens that have recently emerged from nonpathogens with expanded niches. The observation that the attenuated Dugway isolate has the largest genome with the fewest pseudogenes and IS elements suggests that this isolate's lineage is at an earlier stage of pathoadaptation than the NM, K, and G lineages.","['Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Bacterial', 'Coxiella burnetii/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virulence']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosome report', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Transposon prediction', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Sequence alignment', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
23758687,"Transcriptomic profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed to silver (nanoparticles, bulk and ions) using HT-SuperSAGE in a Illumina GA2 platform","Silver nanoparticles cause toxicity in exposed organisms and are an environmental health concern. The mechanisms of silver nanoparticle toxicity, however, remain unclear. We examined the effects of exposure to silver in nano-, bulk-, and ionic forms on zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) using a Next Generation Sequencing approach in an Illumina platform (High-Throughput SuperSAGE). Significant alterations in gene expression were found for all treatments and many of the gene pathways affected, most notably those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis, overlapped strongly between the three treatments indicating similar mechanisms of toxicity for the three forms of silver studied. Changes in oxidative phosphorylation indicated a down-regulation of this pathway at 24 h of exposure, but with a recovery at 48 h. This finding was consistent with a dose-dependent decrease in oxygen consumption at 24 h, but not at 48 h, following exposure to silver ions. Overall, our data provide support for the hypothesis that the toxicity caused by silver nanoparticles is principally associated with bioavailable silver ions in exposed zebrafish embryos. These findings are important in the evaluation of the risk that silver particles may pose to exposed vertebrate organisms.","['Animals', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*toxicity', 'Silver/*chemistry', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Article metadata', 'Article', 'Article ID', 'SILAC', 'Fish']"
23704987,Transcriptional profiling of Rapamycin-treated ptc6 and ptc1ptc6 mutant yeast cells,"Ptc6 is one of the seven components (Ptc1-Ptc7) of the protein phosphatase 2C family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to other type 2C phosphatases, the cellular role of this isoform is poorly understood. We present here a comprehensive characterization of this gene product. Cells lacking Ptc6 are sensitive to zinc ions, and somewhat tolerant to cell-wall damaging agents and to Li(+). Ptc6 mutants are sensitive to rapamycin, albeit to lesser extent than ptc1 cells. This phenotype is not rescued by overexpression of PTC1 and mutation of ptc6 does not reproduce the characteristic genetic interactions of the ptc1 mutation with components of the TOR pathway, thus suggesting different cellular roles for both isoforms. We show here that the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype of ptc6 cells is unrelated to the reported role of Pt6 in controlling pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Lack of Ptc6 results in substantial attenuation of the transcriptional response to rapamycin, particularly in the subset of repressed genes encoding ribosomal proteins or involved in rRNA processing. In contrast, repressed genes involved in translation are Ptc6-independent. These effects cannot be attributed to the regulation of the Sch9 kinase, but they could involve modulation of the binding of the Ifh1 co-activator to specific gene promoters.","['Down-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Epistasis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal/drug effects', 'Genes, Fungal/genetics', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Mitophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/drug effects', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/*genetics/growth & development', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology']","['Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Epistasis', 'Genetic map', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Fungi', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Protein databases', 'protein', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'RNA', 'Chromosomes', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein accession', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Virology']"
23565251,Expression data in Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice with linezolid and vancomycin treatment,"Linezolid (L), a potent antibiotic for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. By contrast, vancomycin (V) is a cell wall active agent. Here, we used a murine sepsis model to test the hypothesis that L treatment is associated with differences in bacterial and host characteristics as compared to V. Mice were injected with S. aureus USA300, and then intravenously treated with 25 mg/kg of either L or V at 2 hours post infection (hpi). In vivo alpha-hemolysin production was reduced in both L and V-treated mice compared to untreated mice but the reduction did not reach the statistical significance [P = 0.12 for L; P = 0.70 for V). PVL was significantly reduced in L-treated mice compared to untreated mice (P = 0.02). However the reduction of in vivo PVL did not reach the statistical significance in V- treated mice compared to untreated mice (P = 0.27). Both antibiotics significantly reduced IL-1β production [P = 0.001 for L; P = 0.006 for V]. IL-6 was significantly reduced with L but not V antibiotic treatment [P<0.001 for L; P = 0.11 for V]. Neither treatment significantly reduced production of TNF-α. Whole-blood gene expression profiling showed no significant effect of L and V on uninfected mice. In S. aureus-infected mice, L altered the expression of a greater number of genes than V (95 vs. 42; P = 0.001). Pathway analysis for the differentially expressed genes identified toll-like receptor signaling pathway to be common to each S. aureus-infected comparison. Expression of immunomodulatory genes like Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Il1r2, Cd14 and Nfkbia was different among the treatment groups. Glycerolipid metabolism pathway was uniquely associated with L treatment in S. aureus infection. This study demonstrates that, as compared to V, treatment with L is associated with reduced levels of toxin production, differences in host inflammatory response, and distinct host gene expression characteristics in MRSA sepsis.","['Acetamides/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Linezolid', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Oxazolidinones/*therapeutic use', 'Sepsis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Vancomycin/*therapeutic use']","['ACE', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence analysis']"
22851595,In vitro responses of fibroblasts from patients with TBK1 deficiency after TLR3 dependent and independent stimuli,"Childhood herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) may result from single-gene inborn errors of TLR3 immunity. TLR3-dependent induction of IFN-α/β or IFN-λ is crucial for protective immunity against primary HSV-1 infection in the central nervous system (CNS). We describe here two unrelated children with HSE carrying different heterozygous mutations (D50A and G159A) in TBK1, the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1, a kinase at the crossroads of multiple IFN-inducing signaling pathways. Both mutant TBK1 alleles are loss-of-function but through different mechanisms: protein instability (D50A) or a loss of kinase activity (G159A). Both are also associated with an autosomal-dominant (AD) trait but by different mechanisms: haplotype insufficiency (D50A) or negative dominance (G159A). A defect in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced TLR3 responses can be detected in fibroblasts heterozygous for G159A but not for D50A TBK1. Nevertheless, viral replication and cell death rates caused by two TLR3-dependent viruses (HSV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus) were high in fibroblasts from both patients, and particularly so in G159A TBK1 fibroblasts. These phenotypes were rescued equally well by IFN-α2b. Moreover, the IFN responses to the TLR3-independent agonists and viruses tested were maintained in both patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells and fibroblasts. The narrow, partial cellular phenotype thus accounts for the clinical phenotype of these patients being limited to HSE. These data identify AD partial TBK1 deficiency as a new genetic etiology of childhood HSE, indicating that TBK1 is essential for the TLR3- and IFN-dependent control of HSV-1 in the CNS.","['Animals', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Encephalitis, Herpes Simplex/*genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/immunology/virology', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/*immunology', 'Vesiculovirus/pathogenicity']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Protein complex', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Virus identifier', 'Human disease', 'Protein interaction data', 'Beta diversity data', 'Protein interaction ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'PolyA signal detection', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'PolyA signal or sites', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Protein threading', 'Virus annotation']"
23762861,Molecular Profiling provides evidence of the existence of two functionally distinct classes of ovarian cancer stroma,"Although stromal cell signaling has been shown to play a significant role in the progression of many cancers, relatively little is known about its importance in modulating ovarian cancer development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the process of stroma activation in human ovarian cancer by molecular analysis of matched sets of cancer and surrounding stroma tissues. RNA microarray profiling of 45 tissue samples was carried out using the Affymetrix (U133 Plus 2.0) gene expression platform. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to isolate cancer cells from the tumors of ovarian cancer patients (Cepi) and matched sets of surrounding cancer stroma (CS). For controls, ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSE) were isolated from the normal (noncancerous) ovaries and normal stroma (NS). Hierarchical clustering of the microarray data resulted in clear separations between the OSE, Cepi, NS, and CS samples. Expression patterns of genes encoding signaling molecules and compatible receptors in the CS and Cepi samples indicate the existence of two subgroups of cancer stroma (CS) with different propensities to support tumor growth. Our results indicate that functionally significant variability exists among ovarian cancer patients in the ability of the microenvironment to modulate cancer development.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Ovary/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation']"
20864035,CRTC2 couples genotoxic stress and plasma cell differentiation in the germinal center,"During an immune response, B cells undergo rapid proliferation and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent remodeling of immunoglobulin (IG) genes within germinal centers (GCs) to generate memory B and plasma cells. Unfortunately, the genotoxic stress associated with the GC reaction also promotes most B cell malignancies. Here, we report that exogenous and intrinsic AID-induced DNA strand breaks activate ATM, which signals through an LKB1 intermediate to inactivate CRTC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB. Using genome-wide location analysis, we determined that CRTC2 inactivation unexpectedly represses a genetic program that controls GC B cell proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation while opposing lymphomagenesis. Inhibition of this pathway results in increased GC B cell proliferation, reduced antibody secretion, and impaired terminal differentiation. Multiple distinct pathway disruptions were also identified in human GC B cell lymphoma patient samples. Combined, our data show that CRTC2 inactivation, via physiologic DNA damage response signaling, promotes B cell differentiation in response to genotoxic stress.","['AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*immunology/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*immunology/radiation effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Germinal Center/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/physiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Metformin/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/immunology/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Kinase name', 'Protein databases', 'Protein active sites', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Nucleic acid structure report', 'Transposon prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'Mutation ID', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA structure', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Terminal gap penalty', 'Structure determination', 'Terminal gap extension penalty', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acid features (immunoglobulin gene structure)', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunogen design', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'PlasMapper TextMap', 'Protein threading', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Protein expression']"

The gene expression profile of each metabolic state was distinguishable from CTRLs and correlated with other metabolic states more than with RA. Of note, subjects in the metabolic cohorts overexpressed gene sets that participate in the innate immune response. Genes involved in activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, were overexpressed in CAD whereas genes differentially expressed in T2D have key roles in T-cell activation and signaling. Reverse transcriptase PCR validation confirmed microarray results. Furthermore, several genes differentially expressed in human metabolic disorders have been previously shown to participate in inflammatory responses in murine models of obesity and T2D.

21112978,Genome-wide connection between DNA methylation and DNA replication timing,"Understanding how the epigenetic blueprint of the genome shapes human phenotypes requires systematic evaluation of the complex interplay between gene activity and the different layers of the epigenome. Utilizing microarray-based techniques, we explored the relationships between DNA methylation, DNA replication timing and gene expression levels across a variety of human tissues and cell lines. The analyses revealed unequal methylation levels among early- and late-replicating fractions of the genome: late-replicating DNA was hypomethylated compared with early-replicating DNA. Moreover, late-replicating regions were gradually demethylated with cell divisions, whereas the methylation of early-replicating regions was better maintained. As active genes concentrate at early-replicating regions, they are overall hypermethylated relative to inactive genes. Accordingly, we show that the previously reported positive correlation between gene-body methylation (methylation of the transcribed portion of genes) and gene expression is restricted to proliferative tissues and cell lines, whereas in tissues containing few proliferating cells, active and inactive genes have similar methylation levels. We further show that active gene bodies are hypermethylated not only compared with inactive gene bodies, but also compared with their flanking sequences. This specific hypermethylation of the active gene bodies is severely disrupted in cells of an immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome patient bearing mutated DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B). Our data show that a high methylation level is preferentially maintained in active gene bodies through independent cellular processes. Rather than serving as a distinctive mark between active and inactive genes, gene-body methylation appears to serve a vital, currently unknown function in active genes.","['Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', '*DNA Replication', 'Epigenomics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA modification prediction', 'Duplication detection', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Virtual screening', 'Compound libraries and screening', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data']"
21589905,Transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis plants that constitutively express suppressors of RNA silencing,"In Arabidopsis, micro (mi)RNAs and trans-acting (ta-si)RNAs synthesized directly or indirectly through the DICER-LIKE-1 (DCL1) ribonuclease have roles in patterning and hormonal responses, while DCL2,3,4-dependent small-interfering (si)RNAs are mainly involved in silencing of transposable elements and antiviral defense. Viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) produced by phytoviruses to counter plant defense may perturb plant developmental programs because of the collision of their inhibitory effects with the regulatory action of endogenous miRNAs and ta-siRNAs. This could explain the similar developmental aberrations displayed by Arabidopsis miRNA/ta-siRNA pathway mutants, including dcl1, and by some VSR-expressing plants. Nonetheless, the molecular bases for these morphological aberrations have remained mysterious, and their contribution to viral disease symptoms/virulence unexplored. The extent of VSR inhibitory actions to other types of endogenous small RNAs remains also unclear. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing constitutively HcPro, P19 and P15, three unrelated VSRs. We show that VSR expression has comparable, yet modest effects on known miRNA and ta-siRNA target RNA levels, similar to those observed using an hypomorphic dcl1 mutation. However, by combining results of transcriptome studies with deep-sequencing data from immuno-precipitated small RNAs, additional, novel endogenous targets of miRNA and ta-siRNA were identified, unraveling an unsuspected complexity in the origin and scope-of-action of these molecules. Other stringent analyses pinpointed misregulation of the miR167 target AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8) as a major cause for the developmental aberrations exhibited by VSR transgenic plants, but also for the phenotypes induced during normal viral infection caused by the HcPro-encoding Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Neither RNA silencing, its suppression by VSRs, nor the virulence/accumulation of TuMV was altered by mutations in ARF8. These findings have important implications for our understanding of viral disease symptoms and small RNA-directed regulation of plant growth/development.","['Arabidopsis/*genetics/*growth & development/virology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Indoleacetic Acids/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Immunity', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Stems', 'Plants, Genetically Modified/genetics/growth & development/virology', 'Potyvirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Ribonuclease III/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Transgenes']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Cell cycle', 'protein', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Nucleic acids', 'ACE', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'DNA barcoding', 'Plant biology', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Citation', 'RNA-Seq', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcript report']"

Additionally, differences in temporal and strain specific gene expression can also contribute to phenotypes in the mammalian retina. This is the first report of microarray based cross-strain analysis of gene expression in the retina investigating genetic background effects. Microarray analyses were performed on retinas from the following mouse strains: C57BL6/J, AKR/J, CAST/EiJ, and NOD.NON-H2(-nb1) at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) and postnatal day 30.5 (P30.5). Over 3000 differentially expressed genes were identified between strains and developmental stages. Differential gene expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Three major gene networks were identified that function to regulate retinal or photoreceptor development, visual perception, cellular transport, and signal transduction. Many of the genes in these networks are implicated in retinal diseases such as bradyopsia, night-blindness, and cone-rod dystrophy. Our analysis revealed strain specific variations in cone photoreceptor cell patterning and retinal function. This study highlights the substantial impact of genetic background on both development and function of the retina and the level of gene expression differences tolerated for normal retinal function.

Analyses of previously sequenced genomes of B. animalis subsp. lactis have revealed little genetic diversity, suggesting that it is a monomorphic subspecies. However, during a multilocus sequence typing survey of Bifidobacterium, it was revealed that B. animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673 gave a profile distinct from that of the other strains of the subspecies. As part of an ongoing study designed to understand the genetic diversity of this subspecies, the genome of this strain was sequenced and compared to other sequenced genomes of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. animalis subsp. animalis. The complete genome of ATCC 27673 was 1,963,012 bp, contained 1,616 genes and 4 rRNA operons, and had a G+C content of 61.55%. Comparative analyses revealed that the genome of ATCC 27673 contained six distinct genomic islands encoding 83 open reading frames not found in other strains of the same subspecies. In four islands, either phage or mobile genetic elements were identified. In island 6, a novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus which contained 81 unique spacers was identified. This type I-E CRISPR-cas system differs from the type I-C systems previously identified in this subspecies, representing the first identification of a different system in B. animalis subsp. lactis.

We have investigated the molecular signatures and underlying genomic aberrations associated with RCC metastasis, using an approach that combines a human xenograft model; expression profiling of RNA, DNA, and microRNA (miRNA); functional verification; and clinical validation. We show that increased metastatic activity is associated with acquisition of a myofibroblast-like signature in both tumor cell lines and in metastatic tumor biopsies. Our results also show that the mesenchymal trait did not provide an invasive advantage to the metastatic tumor cells. We further show that some of the constituents of the mesenchymal signature, including the expression of the well-characterized myofibroblastic marker S100A4, are functionally relevant. Epigenetic silencing and miRNA-induced expression changes accounted for the change in expression of a significant number of genes, including S100A4, in the myofibroblastic signature; however, DNA copy number variation did not affect the same set of genes. These findings provide evidence that widespread genetic and epigenetic alterations can lead directly to global deregulation of gene expression and contribute to the development or progression of RCC metastasis culminating in a highly malignant myofibroblast-like cell.","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myofibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Cell line report', 'Cell type accession', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Transition matrix', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Keyword', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Informatics', 'Plant biology', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Epistasis', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'SAGE experimental data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Transposon prediction', 'Cell culture collection', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell and tissue culture']"
19270705,Validation of a subset of copy number variants from GSE24424 by aCGH,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a key source of genetic diversity, but a comprehensive understanding of its phenotypic effect is only beginning to emerge. We have generated a CNV map in wild mice and classical inbred strains. Genome-wide expression data from six major organs show not only that expression of genes within CNVs tend to correlate with copy number changes, but also that CNVs influence the expression of genes in their vicinity, an effect that extends up to half a megabase. Genes within CNVs show lower expression and more specific spatial expression patterns than genes mapping elsewhere. Our analyses reveal differential constraint on copy number changes of genes expressed in different tissues. Dosage alterations of brain-expressed genes are less frequent than those of other genes and are buffered by tighter transcriptional regulation. Our study provides initial evidence that CNVs shape tissue transcriptomes on a global scale.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome name', 'Chromosome report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
23056196,Helianthus annuus Transcriptome or Gene expression,"Identifying the connections between molecular and physiological processes underlying the diversity of drought stress responses in plants is key for basic and applied science. Drought stress response involves a large number of molecular pathways and subsequent physiological processes. Therefore, it constitutes an archetypical systems biology model. We first inferred a gene-phenotype network exploiting differences in drought responses of eight sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes to two drought stress scenarios. Large transcriptomic data were obtained with the sunflower Affymetrix microarray, comprising 32423 probesets, and were associated to nine morpho-physiological traits (integrated transpired water, leaf transpiration rate, osmotic potential, relative water content, leaf mass per area, carbon isotope discrimination, plant height, number of leaves and collar diameter) using sPLS regression. Overall, we could associate the expression patterns of 1263 probesets to six phenotypic traits and identify if correlations were due to treatment, genotype and/or their interaction. We also identified genes whose expression is affected at moderate and/or intense drought stress together with genes whose expression variation could explain phenotypic and drought tolerance variability among our genetic material. We then used the network model to study phenotypic changes in less tractable agronomical conditions, i.e. sunflower hybrids subjected to different watering regimes in field trials. Mapping this new dataset in the gene-phenotype network allowed us to identify genes whose expression was robustly affected by water deprivation in both controlled and field conditions. The enrichment in genes correlated to relative water content and osmotic potential provides evidence of the importance of these traits in agronomical conditions.","['Adaptation, Physiological/drug effects/*genetics', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Droughts', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment, Controlled', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/drug effects', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Helianthus/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Phenotype', 'Transcriptome', 'Water/metabolism/pharmacology']","['Physiology', 'Codon adaptation index', 'Biological model accession', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Analysis', 'Sequence analysis', 'GTrack', 'GSuite', 'BTrack', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Genetic variation', 'DNA variation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Helical net', 'Helical wheel', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic engineering', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Phenotype name', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Waters RAW', 'Freshwater biology']"
21712494,Critical Role of Sphingolipid Pathway Components in Murine Radiation-Induced Lung Injury: Protection by Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Analogues,"Clinically significant radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a common toxicity in patients administered thoracic radiotherapy. Although the molecular etiology is poorly understood, we previously characterized a murine model of RILI in which alterations in lung barrier integrity surfaced as a potentially important pathobiological event and genome-wide lung gene mRNA levels identified dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolic pathway genes. We hypothesized that sphingolipid signaling components serve as modulators and novel therapeutic targets of RILI. Sphingolipid involvement in murine RILI was confirmed by radiation-induced increases in lung expression of sphingosine kinase (SphK) isoforms 1 and 2 and increases in the ratio of ceramide to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydro-S1P (DHS1P) levels in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue. Mice with a targeted deletion of SphK1 (SphK1(-/-)) or with reduced expression of S1P receptors (S1PR1(+/-), S1PR2(-/-), and S1PR3(-/-)) exhibited marked RILI susceptibility. Finally, studies of 3 potent vascular barrier-protective S1P analogs, FTY720, (S)-FTY720-phosphonate (fTyS), and SEW-2871, identified significant RILI attenuation and radiation-induced gene dysregulation by the phosphonate analog, fTyS (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p., 2×/wk) and to a lesser degree by SEW-2871 (1 mg/kg i.p., 2×/wk), compared with those in controls. These results support the targeting of S1P signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy in RILI.","['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Lung/*radiation effects', 'Lysophospholipids/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Radiation Injuries, Experimental', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/genetics/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipids', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Experimental data', 'Experimental design and studies', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Lipid report', 'Lipid structure']"
21241330,Expression data of QK mutant and wild type of Arabidopsis after heat shock,"In Arabidopsis, there are four homologs of class A1 heat shock factor (HSFA1) genes, which likely encode the master regulators of heat shock response (HSR). However, previous studies with double knockout (KO) mutants were unable to confirm this point probably due to functional redundancy. Here, we generated a quadruple KO (QK) and four triple KO mutants to dissect their functions. Our data show that members of the HSFA1 group not only play a pivotal role in HSR but also are involved in growth and development. Alterations in morphology and retardation in growth were observed in the quadruple but not in triple KO mutants. The basal and acquired thermotolerance capacity was dramatically decreased in the QK mutant but varied in triple KO mutants at different developmental stages. The transcriptomics profiles suggested that more than 65% of the heat stress (HS)-up-regulated genes were HSFA1 dependent. HSFA1s were also involved in the expression of several HS genes induced by H(2) O(2) , salt and mannitol, which is consistent with the increased sensitive phenotype of the QK mutant to the stress factors. In conclusion, the Arabidopsis HSFA1s function as the master regulators of HSR and participate as important components in other abiotic stress responses as well.","['Arabidopsis/genetics/growth & development/*physiology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plant Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Plant/genetics', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Heat map', 'Heat map generation', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'rna', 'RNA', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"

However information about its control over seed coat biochemistry and gene expressions remains limited. The seed coats of nearly-isogenic black (iRT) and brown (irT) soybean (Glycine max) were known to differ by the presence or absence of anthocyanins, respectively, with genes for only a single enzyme (anthocyanidin synthase) found to be differentially expressed between isolines. We recently identified and characterized a UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase (UGT78K1) from the seed coat of black (iRT) soybean with the aim to engineer seed coat color by suppression of an anthocyanin-specific gene. However, it remained to be investigated whether UGT78K1 was overexpressed with anthocyanin biosynthesis in the black (iRT) seed coat compared to the nearly-isogenic brown (irT) tissue.In this study, we performed a combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolite data to elucidate the control of the R locus over seed coat biochemistry and to identify pigment biosynthesis genes. Two differentially expressed late-stage anthocyanin biosynthesis isogenes were further characterized, as they may serve as useful targets for the manipulation of soybean grain color while minimizing the potential for unintended effects on the plant system.","['Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Plant/*genetics', 'Glycosyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pigmentation/*genetics', 'Pigments, Biological/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds/enzymology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Soybeans/enzymology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Documentation and help', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

Earlier, we had synthesized monodispersive crystalline silver nanoparticles using B. cereus PGN1 and ATCC14579 strains. These strains have showed high level of resistance to silver nitrate (1 mM) but their global transcriptomic response has not been studied earlier. In this study, we investigated the cellular and metabolic response of B. cereus ATCC14579 treated with 1 mM silver nitrate for 30 & 60 min. Global expression profiling using genomic DNA microarray indicated that 10% (n = 524) of the total genes (n = 5234) represented on the microarray were up-regulated in the cells treated with silver nitrate. The majority of genes encoding for chaperones (GroEL), nutrient transporters, DNA replication, membrane proteins, etc. were up-regulated. A substantial number of the genes encoding chemotaxis and flagellar proteins were observed to be down-regulated. Motility assay of the silver nitrate treated cells revealed reduction in their chemotactic activity compared to the control cells.

Despite their utility for modeling development and disease, the relationship of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell states to one another remains largely undefined. We have shown that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are distinct, pluripotent states isolated from pre- and post-implantation embryos respectively. Human ES cells are different than mouse ES cells and share defining features with EpiSCs, yet are derived from pre-implantation human embryos. Here we show that EpiSCs can be routinely derived from pre-implantation mouse embryos. The preimplantation-derived EpiSCs exhibit molecular features and functional properties consistent with bona fide EpiSCs. These results provide a simple method for isolating EpiSCs and offer direct insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blastocyst/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Germ Layers/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST results', 'BLAST sequence alignment type', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Gap separation penalty', 'Gap separation penalty (float)', 'Gap separation penalty (integer)', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Keyword', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Regenerative medicine', 'cel', 'System metadata']"
14671302,Chimpanzee gene sequences were developed using PCR based on known human exons,"Even though human and chimpanzee gene sequences are nearly 99% identical, sequence comparisons can nevertheless be highly informative in identifying biologically important changes that have occurred since our ancestral lineages diverged. We analyzed alignments of 7645 chimpanzee gene sequences to their human and mouse orthologs. These three-species sequence alignments allowed us to identify genes undergoing natural selection along the human and chimp lineage by fitting models that include parameters specifying rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution. This evolutionary approach revealed an informative set of genes with significantly different patterns of substitution on the human lineage compared with the chimpanzee and mouse lineages. Partitions of genes into inferred biological classes identified accelerated evolution in several functional classes, including olfaction and nuclear transport. In addition to suggesting adaptive physiological differences between chimps and humans, human-accelerated genes are significantly more likely to underlie major known Mendelian disorders.","['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Computational Biology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics', '*Genome', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Mice/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Mutation', 'Pan troglodytes/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Pseudogenes', 'Receptors, Odorant/genetics', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Smell/genetics', 'Species Specificity']","['Cell line report', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Transposon prediction', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Molecular evolution', 'Molecular data', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Gene name (KEGG GENES)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Rotamer likelihood prediction', 'Phylogenetic inference (maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods)', 'Protein function prediction', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Genetic code', 'Kinetic model', 'Genetic map', 'Statistical modelling', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', ""Ensembl ID ('Pan troglodytes')"", 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'PseudoCAP gene report format', 'Locus ID (PseudoCAP)', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Selection detection', 'Feature selection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence alignment', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Sequence motif (nucleic acid)', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"

We found that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) interacts with HTT and that mutant HTT represses PPAR-δ-mediated transactivation. Increased PPAR-δ transactivation ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and improved cell survival of neurons from mouse models of HD. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-δ in the central nervous system of mice was sufficient to induce motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial abnormalities and transcriptional alterations that recapitulated HD-like phenotypes. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-δ specifically in the striatum of medium spiny neurons in mice yielded HD-like motor phenotypes, accompanied by striatal neuron loss. In mouse models of HD, pharmacologic activation of PPAR-δ using the agonist KD3010 improved motor function, reduced neurodegeneration and increased survival. PPAR-δ activation also reduced HTT-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in medium spiny-like neurons generated from stem cells derived from individuals with HD, indicating that PPAR-δ activation may be beneficial in HD and related disorders.","['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Huntingtin Protein', 'Huntington Disease/*genetics/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Movement/drug effects', 'Neostriatum/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'PPAR delta/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/agonists/*genetics', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'cel', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein fragment weight comparison', 'Disease name', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Mitochondria', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Data management', 'Proteins', 'Biobank', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Workflows', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data']"

The functional consequences of this upregulation are unclear. To identify molecular pathways coupled to IF regulation in reactive astrocytes, and to study the interaction with microglia, we examined WT and APPswe/PS1dE9 (AD) mice lacking either GFAP, or both VIM and GFAP, and determined the transcriptome of cortical astrocytes and microglia from 15- to 18-month-old mice. Genes involved in lysosomal degradation (including several cathepsins) and in inflammatory response (including Cxcl5, Tlr6, Tnf, Il1b) exhibited a higher AD-induced increase when GFAP, or VIM and GFAP, were absent. The expression of Aqp4 and Gja1 displayed the same pattern. The downregulation of neuronal support genes in astrocytes from AD mice was absent in GFAP/VIM null mice. In contrast, the absence of IFs did not affect the transcriptional alterations induced by AD in microglia, nor was the cortical plaque load altered. Visualizing astrocyte morphology in GFAP-eGFP mice showed no clear structural differences in GFAP/VIM null mice, but did show diminished interaction of astrocyte processes with plaques. Microglial proliferation increased similarly in all AD groups. In conclusion, absence of GFAP, or both GFAP and VIM, alters AD-induced changes in gene expression profile of astrocytes, showing a compensation of the decrease of neuronal support genes and a trend for a slightly higher inflammatory expression profile. However, this has no consequences for the development of plaque load, microglial proliferation, or microglial activation.","['Aged', 'Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL5/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/*deficiency/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microglia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Presenilin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Vimentin/*deficiency/genetics']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein-protein interaction prediction (from protein sequence)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'BioNLP Shared Task format', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Strain accession', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'EM Micrograph', 'Microbiology', 'RNA annotation format', 'Gene expression profiling']"
26755704,The alarmin IL-33 amplifies an immune response in the degenerating retina,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision impairment in the ageing population, is characterized by irreversible loss of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors and can be associated with choroidal neovascularization. Mononuclear phagocytes are often present in AMD lesions, but the processes that direct myeloid cell recruitment remain unclear. Here, we identify IL-33 as a key regulator of inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration after retina stress or injury. IL-33(+) Müller cells were more abundant and IL-33 cytokine was elevated in advanced AMD cases compared with age-matched controls with no AMD. In rodents, retina stress resulted in release of bioactive IL-33 that in turn increased inflammatory chemokine and cytokine expression in activated Müller cells. Deletion of ST2, the IL-33 receptor α chain, or treatment with a soluble IL-33 decoy receptor significantly reduced release of inflammatory mediators from Müller cells, inhibited accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes in the outer retina, and protected photoreceptor rods and cones after a retina insult. This study demonstrates a central role for IL-33 in regulating mononuclear phagocyte recruitment to the photoreceptor layer and positions IL-33 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in macular degenerative diseases.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Ependymoglial Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Interleukin-33/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macula Lutea/immunology/pathology', 'Macular Degeneration/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/immunology/pathology']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Laboratory techniques', 'In vitro selection', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'protein', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Protein interaction data', 'Relaxed PHYLIP Interleaved', 'PHYLIP format', 'Generation', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence generation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein modifications', 'Protein post-translational modifications', 'Protein interaction data processing', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'Protein surface report', 'Surface rendering', 'Protein surface calculation', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)']"
26989192,Differential expression of RNAs in E9 tuft rostrums with NTDs,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cell Polarity', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Ectoderm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neural Tube', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Word size', 'Window size', 'Rigid body refinement', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'consensus', 'Codon name', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Keyword', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene family report', 'Homology modelling', 'Protein modelling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'NeuronDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping']"

Recently, it was shown that the methylation of certain CpG dinucleotides correlates with chronological age and that this epigenetic clock can be applied to study aging-related effects. We investigated these molecular age loci in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues from patients with adenocarcinomas (AC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SQC) as well as in matched tumor-free lung tissue. In both NSCLC subtypes, the calculated epigenetic age did not correlate with the chronological age. In particular, SQC exhibited rejuvenation compared to the corresponding normal lung tissue as well as with the chronological age of the donor. Moreover, the younger epigenetic pattern was associated with a trend toward stem cell-like gene expression patterns. These findings show deep phenotypic differences between the tumor entities AC and SQC, which might be useful for novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.","['Adenocarcinoma of Lung/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Lung/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Bioimaging', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'CpG island and isochores', 'CpG island and isochore detection', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Plasmid map', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"
27422371,miRNA expression profile of PBMCs in healthy subjects after extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake - Part 2 (Controls),"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk but molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are not fully understood. Here we aimed to identify genes and miRNAs expression changes mediated by acute high- and low-polyphenols EVOO intake. Pre- and post-challenge gene and miRNAs expression analysis was performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) by using microarray and RT-qPCR. In healthy subjects, acute intake of EVOO rich in polyphenols was able to ameliorate glycaemia and insulin sensitivity, and to modulate the transcription of genes and miRNAs involved in metabolism, inflammation and cancer, switching PBMCs to a less deleterious inflammatory phenotype; weaker effects were observed in patients with MS as well as in healthy subjects following low-polyphenol EVOO challenge. Concluding, our study shows that acute high-polyphenols EVOO intake is able to modify the transcriptome of PBMCs through the modulation of different pathways associated with the pathophysiology of cardio-metabolic disease and cancer. These beneficial effects are maximized in healthy subjects, and by the use of EVOO cultivars rich in polyphenols. Nutrigenomic changes induced by EVOO thus legitimate the well-known beneficial effects of EVOO in promoting human health and, potentially, preventing the onset of cardiovascular disease and cancer.","['Adult', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Olive Oil/*administration & dosage', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results']","['Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Biomedical science', 'Medical informatics', 'Paediatrics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Metabolic disease', 'Metabolites', 'Metabolic pathways', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Phenomics', 'Phenotype name', 'Phenomenon identifier', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results']"
27699222,Genome-wide analysis of uterine natural killer cell gene expression from lean and obese women in early pregnancy,"Over one-fifth of North American women of childbearing age are obese, putting these women at risk for a variety of detrimental chronic diseases. In addition, obesity increases the risk for developing major complications during pregnancy. The mechanisms by which obesity contributes to pregnancy complications and loss remain unknown. Increasing evidence indicates that obesity results in major changes to adipose tissue immune cell composition and function; whether or not obesity also affects immune function in the uterus has not been explored. Here we investigated the effect of obesity on uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, which are essential for uterine artery remodeling and placental development. Using a cohort of obese or lean women, we found that obesity led to a significant reduction in uNK cell numbers accompanied with impaired uterine artery remodeling. uNK cells isolated from obese women had altered expression of genes and pathways associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and growth factor signaling. Specifically, uNK cells were hyper-responsive to PDGF, resulting in overexpression of decorin. Functionally, decorin strongly inhibited placental development by limiting trophoblast survival. Together, these findings establish a potentially new link between obesity and poor pregnancy outcomes, and indicate that obesity-driven changes to uterine-resident immune cells critically impair placental development.","['Adult', 'Collagen Type III/metabolism', 'Decorin/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Obesity/*physiopathology', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts', 'Uterine Artery/*physiopathology', 'Uterus/*cytology/immunology', '*Vascular Remodeling', 'Young Adult']","['Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'PTM localisation', 'Report', 'Protein sequence record', 'Matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Transition matrix', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Natural product identification', 'Natural language processing', 'Histogram', 'Molecular replacement', 'Plant biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Veterinary medicine', 'Virus identifier', 'Molecular modelling', 'Protein modelling', 'Protein folding analysis']"
28951217,Examining potential modes of action of Styrene inhalation on lung and liver in male C57Bl/6 mice,"Styrene increased lung tumors in mice at chronic inhalation exposures of 20ppm and greater. MIEs, KEs and MFs were examined using gene expression in three strains of male mice (the parental C57BL/6 strain, a CYP2F2(-/-) knock out and a CYP2F2(-/-) transgenic containing human CYP2F1, 2A13 and 2B6). Exposures were for 1-day and 1, 4 and 26weeks. After 1-day exposures at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 120ppm significant increases in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) occurred only in parental strain lungs where there was already an increase in DEGs at 5ppm and then many thousands of DEGs by 120ppm. Enrichment for 1-day and 1-week exposures included cell cycle, mitotic M-M/G1 phases, DNA-synthesis and metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins pathways. The numbers of DEGs decreased steadily over time with no DEGs meeting both statistical significance and fold-change criteria at 26weeks. At 4 and 26weeks, some key transcription factors (TFs) - Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Dbp, Tef, Hlf, Per3, Per2 and Bhlhe40 - were upregulated (|FC|>1.5), while others - Npas, Arntl, Nfil3, Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Nr4a3 - were down-regulated. At all times, consistent changes in gene expression only occurred in the parental strain. Our results support a MIE for styrene of direct mitogenicity from mouse-specific CYP2F2-mediated metabolites activating Nr4a signaling. Longer-term MFs include down-regulation of Nr4a genes and shifts in both circadian clock TFs and other TFs, linking circadian clock to cellular metabolism. We found no gene expression changes indicative of cytotoxicity or activation of p53-mediated DNA-damage pathways.","['Animals', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Circadian Rhythm/drug effects/genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/deficiency/genetics', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Genotype', 'Inhalation Exposure/adverse effects', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lung/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Animal', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Styrenes/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Toxicogenetics/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/*drug effects']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein hydropathy', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Protein signal peptides', 'Protein signal peptide detection', 'Protein features report (signal peptides)', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Enzyme ID', 'Enzyme name', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Family name', 'Protein family name', 'SCOP family', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Format', 'Phenotype name', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Genetics', 'Phylogenetics', 'Toxicology', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
23468496,Homo sapiens strain:KSHV Transcriptome or Gene expression,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma and body cavity lymphoma. In cell culture, KSHV results in a latent infection, and lytic reactivation is usually induced with the expression of K-Rta or by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) and/or n-butyrate. Lytic infection is marked by the activation of the entire viral genomic transcription cascade and the production of infectious virus. KSHV-infected cells express a highly abundant, long, noncoding transcript referred to as polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN RNA). PAN RNA interacts with specific demethylases and physically binds to the KSHV genome to mediate activation of viral gene expression. A recombinant BACmid lacking the PAN RNA locus fails to express K-Rta and does not produce virus. We now show that the lack of PAN RNA expression results in the failure of the initiation of the entire KSHV transcription program. In addition to previous findings of an interaction with demethylases, we show that PAN RNA binds to protein components of Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2). RNA-Seq analysis using cell lines that express PAN RNA shows that transcription involving the expression of proteins involved in cell cycle, immune response, and inflammation is dysregulated. Expression of PAN RNA in various cell types results in an enhanced growth phenotype, higher cell densities, and increased survival compared to control cells. Also, PAN RNA expression mediates a decrease in the production of inflammatory cytokines. These data support a role for PAN RNA as a major global regulator of viral and cellular gene expression.","['*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/pathogenicity/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'RNA, Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Virus identifier', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Human disease', 'RNA', 'rna', 'MRI', 'DNA translation', 'Translational medicine', 'DNA back-translation', 'RNA central ID', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Consequently, few pretreatment tumors have been molecularly profiled, and there are no validated prognostic or therapeutic biomarkers for HB patients. We report on the first large-scale effort to profile pretreatment HBs at diagnosis. Our analysis of 88 clinically annotated HBs revealed three risk-stratifying molecular subtypes that are characterized by differential activation of hepatic progenitor cell markers and metabolic pathways: high-risk tumors were characterized by up-regulated nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 activity; high lin-28 homolog B, high mobility group AT-hook 2, spalt-like transcription factor 4, and alpha-fetoprotein expression; and high coordinated expression of oncofetal proteins and stem-cell markers, while low-risk tumors had low lin-28 homolog B and lethal-7 expression and high hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha activity.","['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics', 'Hepatoblastoma/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Prognosis']","['Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis']"
27016259,Genome-wide analysis of dorsal and ventral transcriptomes of the Xenopus laevis gastrula,"RNA sequencing has allowed high-throughput screening of differential gene expression in many tissues and organisms. Xenopus laevis is a classical embryological and cell-free extract model system, but its genomic sequence had been lacking due to difficulties arising from allotetraploidy. There is currently much excitement surrounding the release of the completed X. laevis genome (version 9.1) by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), which provides a platform for genome-wide studies. Here we present a deep RNA-seq dataset of transcripts expressed in dorsal and ventral lips of the early Xenopus gastrula embryo using the new genomic information, which was further annotated by blast searches against the human proteome. Overall, our findings confirm previous results from differential screenings using other methods that uncovered classical dorsal genes such as Chordin, Noggin and Cerberus, as well as ventral genes such as Sizzled, Ventx, Wnt8 and Bambi. Complete transcriptome-wide tables of mRNAs suitable for data mining are presented, which include many novel dorsal- and ventral-specific genes. RNA-seq was very quantitative and reproducible, and allowed us to define dorsal and ventral signatures useful for gene set expression analyses (GSEA). As an example of a new gene, we present here data on an organizer-specific secreted protein tyrosine kinase known as Pkdcc (protein kinase domain containing, cytoplasmic) or Vlk (vertebrate lonesome kinase). Overexpression experiments indicate that Pkdcc can act as a negative regulator of Wnt/ β-catenin signaling independently of its kinase activity. We conclude that RNA-Seq in combination with the X. laevis complete genome now available provides a powerful tool for unraveling cell-cell signaling pathways during embryonic induction.","['Animals', 'Body Patterning/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/metabolism', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gastrula/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Library', 'Head/embryology', 'Microinjections', 'Organizers, Embryonic/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Transcriptome', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Xenopus Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Xenopus laevis/*embryology/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Prosite protein pattern', 'EMBOSS sequence pattern', 'Variant pattern analysis', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Sequence', 'Expressed gene list', 'Sequence tag profile', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Clone library', 'Spectral library search', 'Gene ID', 'Heat map', 'Read mapping', 'Heat map generation', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Microbial collection', 'Selection detection', 'Genetic organisation', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'protein', 'Protein databases', 'Kinase name', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Signaling pathways', 'Pathway or network', 'Expression profile pathway mapping', 'Proteins', 'Protein domains', ""Ensembl ID ('Xenopus tropicalis')""]"
27514407,A polymorphic intronic enhancer at 19q12 drives CCNE1 expression in bladder cancer cells,"It is well established that environmental toxins, such as exposure to arsenic, are risk factors in the development of urinary bladder cancer, yet recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide compelling evidence that there is a strong genetic component associated with disease predisposition. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs8102137, was identified on chromosome 19q12, residing 6 kb upstream of the important cell-cycle regulator and proto-oncogene, Cyclin E1 (CCNE1). However, the functional role of this variant in bladder cancer predisposition has been unclear because it lies within a non-coding region of the genome. Here, it is demonstrated that bladder cancer cells heterozygous for this SNP exhibit biased allelic expression of CCNE1 with 1.5-fold more transcription occurring from the risk allele. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, a novel enhancer element was identified within the first intron of CCNE1 that binds Kruppel-like Factor 5 (KLF5), a known transcriptional activator in bladder cancer. Moreover, the data reveal that the presence of rs200996365, a SNP in high-linkage disequilibrium with rs8102137 residing in the center of a KLF5 motif, alters KLF5 binding to this genomic region. Through luciferase assays and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, a novel polymorphic intronic regulatory element controlling CCNE1 transcription is characterized. These studies uncover how a cancer-associated polymorphism mechanistically contributes to an increased predisposition for bladder cancer development.","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin E/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics']","['Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Oncology', 'Binary format']"

Here, we used whole genome sequencing to characterize somatic mutations and structural variation in a primary acral melanoma and its lymph node metastasis. Our data show that the somatic mutational rates in this acral melanoma sample pair were more comparable to the rates reported in cancer genomes not associated with mutagenic exposure than in the genome of a melanoma cell line or the transcriptome of melanoma short-term cultures. Despite the perception that acral skin is sun-protected, the dominant mutational signature in these samples is compatible with damage due to ultraviolet light exposure. A nonsense mutation in ERCC5 discovered in both the primary and metastatic tumors could also have contributed to the mutational signature through accumulation of unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions. However, evidence of transcription-coupled repair was suggested by the lower mutational rate in the transcribed regions and expressed genes. The primary and the metastasis are highly similar at the level of global gene copy number alterations, loss of heterozygosity and single nucleotide variation (SNV). Furthermore, the majority of the SNVs in the primary tumor were propagated in the metastasis and one nonsynonymous coding SNV and one splice site mutation appeared to arise de novo in the metastatic lesion.","['Aged', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exome', '*Genome, Human', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'DNA variation', 'DNA', 'Analysis', 'Function analysis', 'Exome sequencing', 'Exome assembly', 'Exons', 'Human genetics', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'Heterogen annotation', 'MAT', 'ELAND format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Epistasis', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection']"
22114689,ATR1 Boron Transporter is Regulated by Gcn4 Transcription Factor in Response to Boron Stress,"Boron is an essential micronutrient for plants, and it is beneficial for animals. However, at high concentrations boron is toxic to cells although the mechanism of this toxicity is not known. Atr1 has recently been identified as a boron efflux pump whose expression is upregulated in response to boron treatment. Here, we found that the expression of ATR1 is associated with expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. These mechanisms are strictly controlled by the transcription factor Gcn4 in response to boron treatment. Further analyses have shown that boron impaired protein synthesis by promoting phosphorylation of eIF2α in a Gcn2 kinase dependent manner. The uncharged tRNA binding domain (HisRS) of Gcn2 is necessary for the phosphorylation of eIF2α in the presence of boron. We postulate that boron exerts its toxic effect through activation of the general amino acid control system and inhibition of protein synthesis. Since the general amino acid control pathway is conserved among eukaryotes, this mechanism of boron toxicity may be of general importance.","['Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Aminoacylation/drug effects', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boron/*adverse effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/metabolism']","['Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Amino acid annotation', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'protein', 'Synthetic biology', 'Protein analysis', 'Protein threading', 'Protein databases', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'DNA translation', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein accession', 'Kinase name']"
21734013,microRNA expression signatures in colorectal cancer cell lines with demethylating treatment,"Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNA) occurs commonly in human cancer, but the mechanisms are generally poorly understood. In this study, we examined the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to miRNA dysregulation in colorectal cancer by carrying out high-resolution ChIP-seq. Specifically, we conducted genome-wide profiling of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and dimethylated histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79me2) in colorectal cancer cell lines. Combining miRNA expression profiles with chromatin signatures enabled us to predict the active promoters of 233 miRNAs encoded in 174 putative primary transcription units. By then comparing miRNA expression and histone modification before and after DNA demethylation, we identified 47 miRNAs encoded in 37 primary transcription units as potential targets of epigenetic silencing. The promoters of 22 transcription units were associated with CpG islands (CGI), all of which were hypermethylated in colorectal cancer cells. DNA demethylation led to increased H3K4me3 marking at silenced miRNA genes, whereas no restoration of H3K79me2 was detected in CGI-methylated miRNA genes. DNA demethylation also led to upregulation of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in a number of CGI-methylated miRNA genes. Among the miRNAs we found to be dysregulated, many of which are implicated in human cancer, miR-1-1 was methylated frequently in early and advanced colorectal cancer in which it may act as a tumor suppressor. Our findings offer insight into the association between chromatin signatures and miRNA dysregulation in cancer, and they also suggest that miRNA reexpression may contribute to the effects of epigenetic therapy.","['Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']","['Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Color', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Epistasis', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'RNA-Seq', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters']"
21896641,Mast cell targeting hampers prostate adenocarcinoma development but promotes the occurrence of highly malignant neuroendocrine cancers.,"Mast cells (MC) are c-Kit-expressing cells, best known for their primary involvement in allergic reactions, but recently reappraised as important players in either cancer promotion or inhibition. Here, we assessed the role of MCs in prostate tumor development. In prostate tumors from both tumor-prone transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice and human patients, MCs are specifically enriched and degranulated in areas of well-differentiated (WD) adenocarcinoma but not around poorly differentiated (PD) foci that coexist in the same tumors. We derived novel TRAMP tumor cell lines, representative of WD and PD variants, and through pharmacologic stabilization or genetic ablation of MCs in recipients mice, we showed that MCs promote WD adenocarcinoma growth but are dispensable for PD tumors. WD tumors rely on MCs for matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) provision, as reconstitution of MC-deficient mice with wild-type but not MMP-9(-/-) MCs was sufficient to promote their growth. In contrast, PD tumors are MMP-9 self-competent, consistently with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Such a dual source of MMP-9 was confirmed in human tumors, suggesting that MCs could be a good target for early-stage prostate cancer. Interestingly, in testing whether MC targeting could block or delay tumorigenesis in tumor-prone TRAMP mice, we observed a high incidence of early and aggressive tumors, characterized by a neuroendocrine (NE) signature and c-Kit expression. Taken together, these data underscore the contribution of MCs in tumor progression and uncover a new, opposite role of MCs in protecting against the occurrence of aggressive NE variants in prostate cancer.","['Adenocarcinoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25', 'Tumor Microenvironment']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell line report', 'Cell migration track image', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Transition matrix', 'HMMER emission and transition', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'rast', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Matrix', 'Protein distance matrix', 'Matrix format', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Environmental information processing pathways']"

Like other metals, copper is highly persistent in the environment and biologically active long after its use has ceased. Here we present a unique study on the long-term effects (27 years) of copper and pH on soil microbial communities and on the springtail Folsomia candida an important representative of the soil macrofauna, in an experiment with a full factorial, random block design. Bacterial communities were mostly affected by pH. These effects were prominent in Acidobacteria, while Actinobacteria and Gammaroteobacteria communities were affected by original and bioavailable copper. Reproduction and survival of the collembolan F. candida was not affected by the studied copper concentrations. However, the transcriptomic responses to copper reflected a mechanism of copper transport and detoxification, while pH exerted effects on nucleotide and protein metabolism and (acute) inflammatory response. We conclude that microbial community structure reflected the history of copper contamination, while gene expression analysis of F. candida is associated with the current level of bioavailable copper. The study is a first step in the development of a molecular strategy aiming at a more comprehensive assessment of various aspects of soil quality and ecotoxicology.","['*Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arthropods/drug effects/*genetics', 'Bacteria/classification/*growth & development', 'Biological Availability', 'Copper/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Reproduction/genetics', 'Soil/*chemistry', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Soil Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']","['Agricultural science', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental information processing pathways', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Concentration', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Vienna RNA concentration data', 'Reproductive health', 'Protein report', 'Natural product identification', 'Microbiology', 'Plant biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

27570068,Expression data from control and Med12-deficient hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors,"Hematopoietic-specific transcription factors require coactivators to communicate with the general transcription machinery and establish transcriptional programs that maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, promote differentiation, and prevent malignant transformation. Mediator is a large coactivator complex that bridges enhancer-localized transcription factors with promoters, but little is known about Mediator function in adult stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We show that MED12, a member of the Mediator kinase module, is an essential regulator of HSC homeostasis, as in vivo deletion of Med12 causes rapid bone marrow aplasia leading to acute lethality. Deleting other members of the Mediator kinase module does not affect HSC function, suggesting kinase-independent roles of MED12. MED12 deletion destabilizes P300 binding at lineage-specific enhancers, resulting in H3K27Ac depletion, enhancer de-activation, and consequent loss of HSC stemness signatures. As MED12 mutations have been described recently in blood malignancies, alterations in MED12-dependent enhancer regulation may control both physiological and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mediator Complex/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'ENCODE narrow peak format', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Gene ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein complex', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Complementary medicine', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
27294512,Expression data of sciatic nerves from mice with Schwann-cell specific Sip1 deletion compared to control mice.,"Schwann cell development and peripheral nerve myelination require the serial expression of transcriptional activators, such as Sox10, Oct6 (also called Scip or Pou3f1) and Krox20 (also called Egr2). Here we show that transcriptional repression, mediated by the zinc-finger protein Zeb2 (also known as Sip1), is essential for differentiation and myelination. Mice lacking Zeb2 in Schwann cells develop a severe peripheral neuropathy, caused by failure of axonal sorting and virtual absence of myelin membranes. Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells continuously express repressors of lineage progression. Moreover, genes for negative regulators of maturation such as Sox2 and Ednrb emerge as Zeb2 target genes, supporting its function as an 'inhibitor of inhibitors' in myelination control. When Zeb2 is deleted in adult mice, Schwann cells readily dedifferentiate following peripheral nerve injury and become repair cells. However, nerve regeneration and remyelination are both perturbed, demonstrating that Zeb2, although undetectable in adult Schwann cells, has a latent function throughout life.","['Animals', 'Axons/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myelin Sheath/*metabolism', 'Nerve Regeneration/*physiology', 'Peripheral Nerve Injuries/*metabolism', 'Peripheral Nerves/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Schwann Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Protein data', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Annotation track', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Generation', 'Sequence generation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence features', 'Proteins', 'Protein expression', 'Cell line report', 'cel', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Zinc finger prediction', 'Gene finding', 'Gene prediction']"
26751771,CFTR is a tumor suppressor gene in murine and human intestinal cancer,"CFTR, the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene, encodes for the CFTR protein that plays an essential role in anion regulation and tissue homeostasis of various epithelia. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract CFTR promotes chloride and bicarbonate secretion, playing an essential role in ion and acid-base homeostasis. Cftr has been identified as a candidate driver gene for colorectal cancer (CRC) in several Sleeping Beauty DNA transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. Further, recent epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that CF patients are at high risk for developing tumors in the colon. To investigate the effects of CFTR dysregulation on GI cancer, we generated Apc(Min) mice that carried an intestinal-specific knockout of Cftr. Our results indicate that Cftr is a tumor suppressor gene in the intestinal tract as Cftr mutant mice developed significantly more tumors in the colon and the entire small intestine. In Apc(+/+) mice aged to ~1 year, Cftr deficiency alone caused the development of intestinal tumors in >60% of mice. Colon organoid formation was significantly increased in organoids created from Cftr mutant mice compared with wild-type controls, suggesting a potential role of Cftr in regulating the intestinal stem cell compartment. Microarray data from the Cftr-deficient colon and the small intestine identified dysregulated genes that belong to groups of immune response, ion channel, intestinal stem cell and other growth signaling regulators. These associated clusters of genes were confirmed by pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We also conducted RNA Seq analysis of tumors from Apc(+/+) Cftr knockout mice and identified sets of genes dysregulated in tumors including altered Wnt β-catenin target genes. Finally we analyzed expression of CFTR in early stage human CRC patients stratified by risk of recurrence and found that loss of expression of CFTR was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.","['Animals', 'Colon/metabolism/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Signal Transduction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Color', 'Ecology', 'Oncology', 'Transmembrane protein analysis', 'Transmembrane protein prediction', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Tumor annotation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"
30011269,Gene expression analysis of miR-210 over-expressing flies at ZT0.,"Single microRNAs are usually associated with hundreds of putative target genes that can influence multiple phenotypic traits in Drosophila, ranging from development to behaviour. We investigated the function of Drosophila miR-210 in circadian behaviour by misexpressing it within circadian clock cells. Manipulation of miR-210 expression levels in the PDF (pigment dispersing factor) positive neurons affected the phase of locomotor activity, under both light-dark conditions and constant darkness. PER cyclical expression was not affected in clock neurons, however, when miR-210 was up-regulated, a dramatic alteration in the morphology of PDF ventral lateral neuron (LNv) arborisations was observed. The effect of miR-210 in shaping neuronal projections was confirmed in vitro, using a Drosophila neuronal cell line. A transcriptomic analysis revealed that miR-210 overexpression affects the expression of several genes belonging to pathways related to circadian processes, neuronal development, GTPases signal transduction and photoreception. Collectively, these data reveal the role of miR-210 in modulating circadian outputs in flies and guiding/remodelling PDF positive LNv arborisations and indicate that miR-210 may have pleiotropic effects on the clock, light perception and neuronal development.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Axons/*metabolism', 'Behavior, Animal/physiology', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Circadian Clocks/genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm/genetics', 'Darkness', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Locomotion/*physiology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/*metabolism', 'Period Circadian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Exons', 'Taxon', 'NCBI taxon', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Developmental biology', 'Laboratory techniques', 'R markdown', 'Promoter prediction', 'EMBL feature location', 'Promoter ID', 'MAT', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides']"

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Caenorhabditis/classification/*genetics', 'Chimera/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Hermaphroditic Organisms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Meiosis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Chimera detection', 'Primer3 primer', 'Primers', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome name', 'Chromosome report', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Clone library', 'Genomics', 'Spectral library search', 'Model organisms', 'Organism name', 'Organism report', 'MAT', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Genetic mapping', 'Sequence alignment']"

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in miRNA expression remain unclear. In this study, we discovered a novel epigenetic mechanism of miR-506 regulation and investigated its functional significance in pancreatic cancer. Sequencing analysis revealed that the miR-506 promoter is highly methylated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. Reduced miR-506 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage, pathologic tumor status, distant metastasis and decreased survival of pancreatic cancer patients. miR-506 inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and enhanced apoptosis and chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a novel target of miR-506, the expression of which inhibited the SPHK1/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is activated in pancreatic cancer. High SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in a large cohort of pancreatic cancer specimens. Our data suggest that miR-506 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA and is epigenetically silenced in pancreatic cancer.

Each sample contains RNA from 3 mice, in order to get enough RNA from this rare stem cell population.","FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for ∼25% of all AML cases and is a subtype that carries a poor prognosis. microRNA-155 (miR-155) is specifically overexpressed in FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML compared with FLT3 wild-type (FLT3-WT) AML and is critical for the growth of FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML cells in vitro. However, miR-155's role in regulating FLT3-ITD-mediated disease in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we used a genetic mouse model to determine whether miR-155 influences the development of FLT3-ITD-induced myeloproliferative disease. Results indicate that miR-155 promotes FLT3-ITD-induced myeloid expansion in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood. Mechanistically, miR-155 increases proliferation of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartments by reducing the growth-inhibitory effects of the interferon (IFN) response, and this involves targeting of Cebpb.

Although several transgenic mouse models of lung hypoplasia exist, the role of miRNAs in this phenotype is incompletely characterized. In this study, we assessed microRNA expression levels during the pseudoglandular to canalicular phase transition of normal human fetal lung development. At this critical time, when the distal respiratory portion of the airways begins to form, microarray analysis showed that the most significantly differentially expressed miRNA was miR-449a. Prediction algorithms determined that N-myc is a target of miR-449a and identified the likely miR-449a:N-myc binding sites, confirmed by luciferase assays and targeted mutagenesis. Functional ex vivo knock-down in organ cultures of murine embryonic lungs, as well as in ovo overexpression in avian embryonic lungs, suggested a role for miR-449a in distal epithelial proliferation. Finally, miR-449a expression was found to be abnormal in rare pulmonary specimens of human fetuses with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia in the pseudoglandular or canalicular phase.

When this formula was applied to the training dataset to check its predictive performance, all of the carcinogens and non-carcinogens were predicted correctly; the prediction formula was then applied to the validation dataset, and five carcinogens and four non-carcinogens were correctly predicted. However, 4-Hydroxy-m-phenylenediammonium dichloride (AMIDOL), a known non-renal carcinogen, was judged as positive. Therefore, the accuracy of the prediction formula for renal carcinogenicity was 100% for the training dataset and 90% for the validation dataset. Among the predictive genes, Hamp and Ranbp1 are known to be important for cell growth and cell cycle regulation, which are important events in carcinogenesis. Given our current limited knowledge of the genes responsible for renal carcinogenesis, the identification of candidate genes of chemical-induced renal carcinogenicity by use of this gene expression-based prediction method represents a promising advance in renal carcinogen identification.","['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Kidney Cortex/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Rats', 'Toxicity Tests, Subacute']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathogens', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'MAT', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Critical care medicine', 'Toxicology']"

RNA-seq of WT and KO at CT0 and CT12. 4C-seq at CT6 and CT18.","Circadian rhythm exerts its influence on animal physiology and behavior by regulating gene expression at various levels. Here we systematically explored circadian long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mouse liver and examined their circadian regulation. We found that a significant proportion of circadian lncRNAs are expressed at enhancer regions, mostly bound by two key circadian transcription factors, BMAL1 and REV-ERBα. These circadian lncRNAs showed similar circadian phases with their nearby genes. The extent of their nuclear localization is higher than protein coding genes but less than enhancer RNAs. The association between enhancer and circadian lncRNAs is also observed in tissues other than liver. Comparative analysis between mouse and rat circadian liver transcriptomes showed that circadian transcription at lncRNA loci tends to be conserved despite of low sequence conservation of lncRNAs. One such circadian lncRNA termed lnc-Crot led us to identify a super-enhancer region interacting with a cluster of genes involved in circadian regulation of metabolism through long-range interactions. Further experiments showed that lnc-Crot locus has enhancer function independent of lnc-Crot's transcription. Our results suggest that the enhancer-associated circadian lncRNAs mark the genomic loci modulating long-range circadian gene regulation and shed new lights on the evolutionary origin of lncRNAs.","['ARNTL Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Circadian Rhythm/*genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Loci', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', '*Transcriptome']","['Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Genetic code', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'protein', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Coding RNA', 'Non-coding RNA', 'RNA', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

However, its biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA-5-HT possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL-23-IL-17 signalling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA-5-HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD4 + Th17 response. Hence, levels of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100–500 nM DHA-5-HT. Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of several metalloproteinases.

32426495,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are in naive pluripotency that represents the ground state of development, from which all cells in the mouse embryo are derived. In contrast, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are in a primed state of pluripotency with many different properties. Despite intense efforts to generate naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), it has not been possible to derive naive hPSCs without relying on transgene overexpression or chemicals. Here, we show that a transient treatment with Torin1, a selective inhibitor of mTOR, converted hPSCs from primed to naive pluripotency. The naive hPSCs were maintained in the same condition as mESCs in defined media with 2iLI (MEK inhibitor, GSK3b inhibitor, LIF and Insulin). Like mESCs, they exhibited high clonal efficiency, rapid cell proliferation, active mitochondrial respiration, X chromosome activation, DNA hypomethylation, and transcriptomes similar to those of human blastocysts than primed hESCs. Most importantly, the naive hPSCs significantly contributed to mouse embryos when transferred to mouse blastocysts. mTor inhibition induced nuclear translocation of TFE3, a critical transcription factor at the interplay of autophagy and pluripotency. TFE3 with mutated nuclear localization signal blocked the conversion from primed to naive pluripotency. It appears that by mimicking diapause at the cellular level, naive pluripotency in human can be readily attained from primed hPSCs, thus establishing the unified ground state of pluripotency in mammals.
We compared the differences in gene expression between primed state and naive state human pluripotent stem cells. RNAseq was performed on primed H9 (PH9), naive H9 (NH9), primed RUES2 (PRUES2), and naive RUES2 (NRUES2) with 3 biological replicates for each line. For each sample, colonies of hPSCs were manually picked and homologized in 1ml TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) was used for RNA extraction. Quality of purified RNA was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. PolyA+ RNA enrichment, cDNA library preparation, sequencing and RPKM calculation were performed at our core facility with standard procedure.","It has not been possible to generate naïve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that substantially contribute to mouse embryos.

When transferred to mouse blastocysts, naïve hPSCs generated 0.1 to 4% human cells, of all three germ layers, including large amounts of enucleated red blood cells, suggesting a marked acceleration of hPSC development in mouse embryos. Torin1 induced nuclear translocation of TFE3; TFE3 with mutated nuclear localization signal blocked the primed-to-naïve conversion. The generation of chimera-competent naïve hPSCs unifies some common features of naïve pluripotency in mammals and may enable applications such as human organ generation in animals.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chimera', 'Humans', 'Mammals', 'Mice', '*Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Chimera detection', 'Primer3 primer', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mammals', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Kinase name']"
17942915,"HGF has been reported to have both positive and negative effects on carcinogenesis. Here we show that the loss of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes enhanced rather than suppressed the early stages of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. c-Met conditional knockout mice (c-metfl/fl, AlbCre+/-; MetLivKO) treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) developed significantly more and bigger tumors and with a shorter latency as compared with control (wt/wt, AlbCre+/-; Cre-Ctrl) mice. Accelerated tumor development was associated with increased rate of cell proliferation and prolonged activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. MetLivKO livers treated with DEN also displayed elevated lipid peroxidation, decreased ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and upregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), all consistent with increased oxidative stress. Likewise, gene expression profiling performed at 3 and 5 months after DEN treatment revealed upregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation and stress responses in c-Met mutant livers. The negative effects of c-Met-deficiency were reversed by chronic oral administration of anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC blocked the EGFR activation and reduced the DEN-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis to the levels of Cre-Ctrl mice. These results argue that intact HGF/c-Met signaling is essential for maintaining normal redox homeostasis in the liver and has tumor suppressor effect(s) during the early stages of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.Keywords: compound treatment design
To address a role for c-Met in liver carcinogenesis, we employed a hepatocyte specific c-Met conditional knockout mouse model generated in our laboratory. Mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 µg/g body weight of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 14 days of age. Livers were examined at 3 and 5 months after DEN injection. Expression profiling was conducted on five animals from each genotype per time point. Total RNA pooled from five wild-type B6/129 strain mouse livers was used as universal hybridization reference. All experiments were performed in duplicates following a dye-swapping design. Arrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments Ltd., Burlingame, CA) in a way to achieve optimal signal intensity at both channels with less than 1% saturated spots. After excluding the invalid features, all arrays were normalized to the 50th percentile of the median signal intensity using the mAdb data analysis suite (http://nciarray.nci.nih.gov/). Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed with the Cluster and TreeView programs (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). The BRB ArrayTools V3.3.0 software package (Biometric Research Branch, National Cancer Institute; http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) was used for the supervised comparison. Differentially expressed genes were selected using a univariate 2-sample t-test (P<0.001) with a random variance model (15). Functional classification of the significant genes was based on the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (www.geneontology.org).","Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been reported to have both positive and negative effects on carcinogenesis.

28052439,"Because insufficiency of the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) limits skeletal growth, there is a great deal of effort to activate Runx2 for clinical use. In this study, we found that MS-275, the class I-specific HDAC inhibitor, activates Runx2 both transcriptionally and translationally. Therefore, we performed NGS analysis to gain accurate patterns of gene expression in mouse calvaria tissue through MS-275 administration. As a result, we could get insight that treatment of MS-275 increases genes related with osteoblast differentiation and cell proliferation, and decreases genes in field of causing apoptosis.

CCD patients suffer from developmental defects in cranial bones. Despite numerous investigations and clinical approaches, no therapeutic strategy has been suggested to prevent CCD. Here, we show that fetal administration of Entinostat/MS-275, a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC)-specific inhibitor, partially prevents delayed closure of cranial sutures in Runx2<sup>+/-</sup> mice strain of C57BL/6J by two mechanisms: 1) posttranslational acetylation of Runx2 protein, which stabilized the protein and activated its transcriptional activity; and 2) epigenetic regulation of Runx2 and other bone marker genes. Moreover, we show that MS-275 stimulates osteoblast proliferation effectively both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that delayed skeletal development in CCD is closely related to the decreased number of progenitor cells as well as the delayed osteogenic differentiation.

33301710,Diversity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from sourdough,"Production of leavened bread dates to the second millennium BCE. Since then, the art of bread making has developed, yet the evolution of bread-associated microbial species remains largely unknown. Nowadays, leavened bread is made either by using a pure commercial culture of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or by propagating a sourdough-a mix of flour and water spontaneously fermented by yeasts and bacteria. We studied the domestication of S. cerevisiae originating from industrial sources and artisanal sourdoughs and tested whether different bread-making processes led to population divergence. We found that S. cerevisiae bakery strains are polyphyletic with 67% of strains clustering into two main clades: most industrial strains were tetraploid and clustered with strains having diverse origins, including beer. By contrast, most sourdough strains were diploid and grouped in a second clade of strains having mosaic genomes and diverse origins, including fruits and natural environments. They harbored a higher copy number of genes involved in maltose utilization, and a high level of gene flow from multiple contributors was detected. Bakery strains displayed higher CO<sub>2</sub> production than do strains from other domesticated lineages (such as beer and wine), revealing a specific phenotypic signature of domestication. Interestingly, industrial strains had a shorter fermentation onset than sourdough strains, which were better adapted to a sourdough-like environment, suggesting divergent selection by industrial and artisanal processes. Our results reveal that the domestication of bakery yeast has been accompanied by dispersion, hybridization, and divergent selection through industrial and artisanal processes.","['Beer/microbiology', 'Bread/*microbiology', '*Domestication', 'Fermentation', 'Phenotype', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*classification/*genetics', 'Wine/microbiology']","['BED', 'BEL', 'Read mapping', 'Read binning', 'Sequence read processing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Raw CATH domain classification', 'Protein domain classification', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Medicine', 'Window size']"

This study analysed hospital effluent and proximate wastewater treatment plants for the presence of antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. Water samples were obtained twice over a three-month period from an urban and rural hospital at three effluent points each, and from two proximate wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) comprising influent and effluent and river water samples up/downstream the WWTPs. Presumptive Klebsiella spp. were enumerated, isolated, and phenotypically confirmed using a well-established commercial test system for Enterobacteriaceae (API20E). Clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were provided by a hospital for comparison. The antibiotic resistance profiles of Klebsiella spp. isolates to 16 selected antibiotics were established according to EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing). In addition, extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase production was analysed. A total of 93 confirmed Klebsiella spp. isolates from hospital effluents and 37 from WWTPs were obtained, comprising K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca. The viable counts for confirmed Klebsiella spp. for hospital effluents ranged from 1.38 × 10<sup>2</sup> to 1.03 × 10<sup>4</sup>, while those for WWTP influent were in a range of 1.76 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 5.10 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml. A higher proportion of Klebsiella spp. from urban hospital effluent was categorized as multidrug-resistant (MDR) (23%) compared to rural hospital effluent (9%). Resistance was observed to all antibiotic classes tested. Several clinical isolates presented resistance to four carbapenem antibiotics, while certain isolates from hospital effluent and WWTPs exhibited ertapenem and doripenem resistance. Fifteen Klebsiella spp. isolates (clinical and from urban hospital effluent) produced carbapenemases. Hospital effluents in South Africa contain antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. and may pose a risk to proximate informal communities if inadequately treated.

Using a metagenomic approach, we investigated the symbiosis of the Adelges laricis/Adelges tardus species complex containing betaproteobacterial (""Candidatus Vallotia tarda"") and gammaproteobacterial (""Candidatus Profftia tarda"") symbionts. Genomic characteristics and metabolic pathway reconstructions revealed that Vallotia and Profftia are evolutionary young endosymbionts, which complement each other's role in essential amino acid production. Phylogenomic analyses and a high level of genomic synteny indicate an origin of the betaproteobacterial symbiont from endosymbionts of Rhizopus fungi. This evolutionary transition was accompanied with substantial loss of functions related to transcription regulation, secondary metabolite production, bacterial defense mechanisms, host infection, and manipulation. The transition from fungus to insect endosymbionts extends our current framework about evolutionary trajectories of host-associated microbes.","['Animals', 'Fungi', '*Hemiptera/microbiology', 'Insecta', 'Phylogeny', '*Symbiosis/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Fungi', 'Fungi annotation', 'Fungi annotation (anamorph)', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Gene symbol', 'Name', 'Gene symbol annotation']"
26051943,Somatic cell fusions reveal extensive heterogeneity in basal-like breast cancer [ChIP-Seq 2],"Basal-like and luminal breast tumors have distinct clinical behavior and molecular profiles, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. To interrogate processes that determine these distinct phenotypes and their inheritance pattern, we generated somatic cell fusions and performed integrated genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation and chromatin) profiling. We found that the basal-like trait is generally dominant and is largely defined by epigenetic repression of luminal transcription factors. Definition of super-enhancers highlighted a core program common in luminal cells but a high degree of heterogeneity in basal-like breast cancers that correlates with clinical outcome. We also found that protein extracts of basal-like cells are sufficient to induce a luminal-to-basal phenotypic switch, implying a trigger of basal-like autoregulatory circuits. We determined that KDM6A might be required for luminal-basal fusions, and we identified EN1, TBX18, and TCF4 as candidate transcriptional regulators of the luminal-to-basal switch.

22826230,X-linked H3K27me3 demethylase Utx is required for embryonic development in a sex-specific manner [ChIP-Seq data],"Embryogenesis requires the timely and coordinated activation of developmental regulators. It has been suggested that the recently discovered class of histone demethylases (UTX and JMJD3) that specifically target the repressive H3K27me3 modification play an important role in the activation of ""bivalent"" genes in response to specific developmental cues. To determine the requirements for UTX in pluripotency and development, we have generated Utx-null ES cells and mutant mice. The loss of UTX had a profound effect during embryogenesis. Utx-null embryos had reduced somite counts, neural tube closure defects and heart malformation that presented between E9.5 and E13.5. Unexpectedly, homozygous mutant female embryos were more severely affected than hemizygous mutant male embryos. In fact, we observed the survival of a subset of UTX-deficient males that were smaller in size and had reduced lifespan. Interestingly, these animals were fertile with normal spermatogenesis. Consistent with a midgestation lethality, UTX-null male and female ES cells gave rise to all three germ layers in teratoma assays, though sex-specific differences could be observed in the activation of developmental regulators in embryoid body assays. Lastly, ChIP-seq analysis revealed an increase in H3K27me3 in Utx-null male ES cells. In summary, our data demonstrate sex-specific requirements for this X-linked gene while suggesting a role for UTY during development.","['Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Embryonic Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Histone Demethylases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Sex Factors']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'DNA methylation', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'Methylation calling', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'CATH domain ID', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Mutation ID', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
23287026,Babesia bigemina MLST scheme,"Bovine babesiosis, caused by the protozoa Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina, is a tick-borne disease distributed in tropical regions worldwide. Current control measures are based on the use of acaricides and live attenuated vaccines. The major economic impact of babesiosis lies in the cattle industry. In order to gain insight into the extent of genetic diversity in populations of parasites in the field, we developed two MLST schemes for the molecular genotyping of B. bigemina and B. bovis. We have also developed a custom-designed bioinformatic pipeline to facilitate the automated processing of raw sequences and further diversity and phylogenetic analysis. The overall MLST scheme exhibited the maximum discriminatory power (Simpson Index=1) for B. bovis and a high level of discrimination for B. bigemina (Simpson Index=0.9545). Genetic diversity was very high and infections with multiple genotypes were frequently found for both parasites in outbreak samples from the Northeast and Northwest of Argentina. Recombination events, which could have arisen from these multiple infections, were suggested by intra-loci linkage disequilibrium analysis and the lack of congruence in phylogenetic trees from individual genes. The two MLST schemes developed here are a robust, objective and easily adoptable technology to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of parasites of the genus Babesia.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Argentina', 'Babesia/*classification/*genetics', 'Babesia bovis/genetics/immunology', 'Babesiosis/*veterinary', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genes, Protozoan', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'geneseq', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Phenotype name', 'Linkage disequilibrium calculation', 'Linkage disequilibrium (report)', 'Genetic map', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Multilocus sequence typing', 'Sequence', 'Sequence type', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'Polymorphism report format']"
35041652,Comparative Pathogenesis of Different Phylogroup I Bat Lyssaviruses in a Standardized Mouse Model,"A plethora of bat-associated lyssaviruses potentially capable of causing the fatal disease rabies are known today. Transmitted via infectious saliva, occasionally-reported spillover infections from bats to other mammals demonstrate the permeability of the species-barrier and highlight the zoonotic potential of bat-related lyssaviruses. However, it is still unknown whether and, if so, to what extent, viruses from different lyssavirus species vary in their pathogenic potential. In order to characterize and systematically compare a broader group of lyssavirus isolates for their viral replication kinetics, pathogenicity, and virus release through saliva-associated virus shedding, we used a mouse infection model comprising a low (102 TCID50) and a high (105 TCID50) inoculation dose as well as three different inoculation routes (intramuscular, intranasal, intracranial). Clinical signs, incubation periods, and survival were investigated. Based on the latter two parameters, a novel pathogenicity matrix was introduced to classify lyssavirus isolates. Using a total of 13 isolates from ten different virus species, this pathogenicity index varied within and between virus species. Interestingly, Irkut virus (IRKV) and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) obtained higher pathogenicity scores (1.14 for IRKV and 1.06 for BBLV) compared to rabies virus (RABV) isolates ranging between 0.19 and 0.85. Also, clinical signs differed significantly between RABV and other bat lyssaviruses. Altogether, our findings suggest a high diversity among lyssavirus isolates concerning survival, incubation period, and clinical signs. Virus shedding significantly differed between RABVs and other lyssaviruses. Our results demonstrated that active shedding of infectious virus was exclusively associated with two RABV isolates (92% for RABV-DogA and 67% for RABV-Insectbat), thus providing a potential explanation as to why sustained spillovers are solely attributed to RABVs. Interestingly, 3D imaging of a selected panel of brain samples from bat-associated lyssaviruses demonstrated a significantly increased percentage of infected astrocytes in mice inoculated with IRKV (10.03%; SD±7.39) compared to RABV-Vampbat (2.23%; SD±2.4), and BBLV (0.78%; SD±1.51), while only individual infected cells were identified in mice infected with Duvenhage virus (DUVV). These results corroborate previous studies on RABV that suggest a role of astrocyte infection in the pathogenicity of lyssaviruses.","['Animals', 'Astrocytes/virology', 'Chiroptera/*virology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Lyssavirus/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Viral', 'Random Allocation', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication', 'Virus Shedding']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Chimera detection', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Virus identifier', 'RNAVirusDB ID', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA central ID', 'Random sequence generation', 'Sequence mutation and randomisation', 'EMBL feature location', 'Infectious disease', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Virus annotation', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Duplication detection']"
26262816,The abundant core community of activated sludge,"Understanding the microbial ecology of a system requires that the observed population dynamics can be linked to their metabolic functions. However, functional characterization is laborious and the choice of organisms should be prioritized to those that are frequently abundant (core) or transiently abundant, which are therefore putatively make the greatest contribution to carbon turnover in the system. We analyzed the microbial communities in 13 Danish wastewater treatment plants with nutrient removal in consecutive years and a single plant periodically over 6 years, using Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA amplicons of the V4 region. The plants contained a core community of 63 abundant genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that made up 68% of the total reads. A core community consisting of abundant OTUs was also observed within the incoming wastewater to three plants. The net growth rate for individual OTUs was quantified using mass balance, and it was found that 10% of the total reads in the activated sludge were from slow or non-growing OTUs, and that their measured abundance was primarily because of immigration with the wastewater. Transiently abundant organisms were also identified. Among them the genus Nitrotoga (class Betaproteobacteria) was the most abundant putative nitrite oxidizer in a number of activated sludge plants, which challenges previous assumptions that Nitrospira (phylum Nitrospirae) are the primary nitrite-oxidizers in activated sludge systems with nutrient removal.","['Bacteria/classification/genetics/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Denmark', 'Ecosystem', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Sewage/*microbiology', 'Wastewater/*microbiology']","['Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'GTrack', 'GSuite', 'BTrack', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'RNA', '2D PAGE image', 'Sequence image', 'Image', 'Waters RAW']"

25964335,Mosaic genome of the Mollicutes-related endobacteria of the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Dentiscutata heterogama,"For more than 450 million years, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have formed intimate, mutualistic symbioses with the vast majority of land plants and are major drivers in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. The obligate plant-symbiotic AMF host additional symbionts, so-called Mollicutes-related endobacteria (MRE). To uncover putative functional roles of these widespread but yet enigmatic MRE, we sequenced the genome of DhMRE living in the AMF Dentiscutata heterogama. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses showed that MRE form a previously unidentified lineage sister to the hominis group of Mycoplasma species. DhMRE possesses a strongly reduced metabolic capacity with 55% of the proteins having unknown function, which reflects unique adaptations to an intracellular lifestyle. We found evidence for transkingdom gene transfer between MRE and their AMF host. At least 27 annotated DhMRE proteins show similarities to nuclear-encoded proteins of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis, which itself lacks MRE. Nuclear-encoded homologs could moreover be identified for another AMF, Gigaspora margarita, and surprisingly, also the non-AMF Mortierella verticillata. Our data indicate a possible origin of the MRE-fungus association in ancestors of the Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina. The DhMRE genome encodes an arsenal of putative regulatory proteins with eukaryotic-like domains, some of them encoded in putative genomic islands. MRE are highly interesting candidates to study the evolution and interactions between an ancient, obligate endosymbiotic prokaryote with its obligate plant-symbiotic fungal host. Our data moreover may be used for further targeted searches for ancient effector-like proteins that may be key components in the regulation of the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis.","['Bacteria/*genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mosaicism', '*Mycorrhizae']","['Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data']"

To investigate the effect of environmental stress on Penaeus monodon gene expression, a 3,853 random cDNA microarray chip was generated with clones originating from six stress-enriched hemocyte libraries generated by suppression subtractive hybridization and a normal hemocyte cDNA library. Changes in temporal gene expression were analyzed from shrimp exposed to hypoxic, hyperthermic, and hypoosmotic conditions; 3.1% of the cDNAs were differentially expressed in response to at least one of the environmental stressors, and 72% of the differentially expressed clones had no significant sequence similarity to previously known genes. Among those genes with high identity to known sequences, the most common functional groups were immune-related genes and non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Hierarchical clustering revealed a set of cDNAs with temporal and stress-specific gene expression profiles as well as a set of cDNAs indicating a common stress response between stressors. Hypoxic and hyperthermic stressors induced the most severe short-term response in terms of gene regulation, and the osmotic stress had the least variation in expression profiles relative to the control. These expression data agree with observed differences in shrimp physical appearance and behavior following exposure to stress conditions.","['Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Hemocytes/metabolism', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune System', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osmosis', 'Penaeidae', 'Retroelements', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Analysis', 'Complementary medicine', 'Reverse complement', 'DNA', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Clone library', 'Spectral library search', 'Affymetrix probe sets library file', 'Immunogenetics', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid restriction', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Read mapping', 'Gap penalty', 'Gap opening penalty', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA sequence']"
17635870,Escherichia coli strain 8624 and Escherichia coli strain VS94 with signaling molecules,"Intrakingdom cell-to-cell communication and interkingdom cell-to-cell communication play essential roles in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Four signals, autoinducer 2 (AI-2), AI-3, and the human hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, are important in this communication. The effect of these signaling compounds on the transcriptome of EHEC was examined in this study. We demonstrated that the luxS mutation affects primarily central metabolic genes in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of E. coli and that addition of exogenous AI-2 does not fully restore the expression profile in a luxS-deficient strain lacking the ability to synthesize AI-2. Addition of AI-3 or epinephrine increased expression of the locus of enterocyte effacement regulon, which is known to play a pivotal role in EHEC virulence. Moreover, when epinephrine was added to the culture medium, the greatest number of gene alterations was observed. These alterations included a greater proportion of alterations in EHEC genes than in MG1655 genes, suggesting that epinephrine may be a global virulence signal. Detailed examination with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed the increases in virulence gene expression with addition of AI-3 and epinephrine. Additional studies with real-time RT-PCR examining the EHEC secreted effectors and putative fimbrial gene expression showed a variable expression profile, indicating that there is differential regulation of the secreted molecules. This study began to examine the global signaling networks in EHEC and revealed expression profiles that are signal and pathogen specific.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Carbon-Sulfur Lyases/genetics', 'Epinephrine/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli O157/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Homoserine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Lactones/*metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Quorum Sensing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Virulence/*genetics', 'Virulence Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Carbon cycle', 'Carbohydrates', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene family report', 'Gene homology (report)', 'Homology modelling', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites']"
17338830,Key stages in mammary gland development.,"The transition from pregnancy to lactation is a critical event in the survival of the newborn since all the nutrient requirements of the infant are provided by milk. While milk contains numerous components, including proteins, that aid in maintaining the health of the infant, lactose and milk fat represent the critical energy providing elements of milk. Much of the research to date on mammary epithelial differentiation has focused upon expression of milk protein genes, providing a somewhat distorted view of alveolar differentiation and secretory activation. While expression of milk protein genes increases during pregnancy and at secretory activation, the genes whose expression is more tightly regulated at this transition are those that regulate lipid biosynthesis. The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors is recognized as regulating fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. We propose that SREBP1 is a critical regulator of secretory activation with regard to lipid biosynthesis, in a manner that responds to diet, and that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt influences this process, resulting in a highly efficient lipid synthetic organ that is able to support the nutritional needs of the newborn.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Lactose/biosynthesis', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/biosynthesis', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Milk Proteins/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1/physiology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Lipids', 'Lipid report', 'Lipid structure', 'Mammals', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'cis-regulatory element prediction']"
16569449,Impact of intestinal colonization and invasion on the Entamoeba histolytica transcriptome.,"A genome-wide transcriptional analysis of Entamoeba histolytica was performed on trophozoites isolated from the colon of six infected mice and from in vitro culture. An Affymetrix platform gene expression array was designed for this analysis that included probe sets for 9435 open reading frames (ORFs) and 9066 5' and 3' flanking regions. Transcripts were detected for > 80% of all ORFs. A total of 523 transcripts (5.2% of all E. histolytica genes) were significantly changed in amebae isolated from the intestine on Days 1 and 29 after infection: 326 and 109 solely on Days 1 and 29, and 88 on both days. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR confirmed these changes in 11/12 genes tested using mRNA isolated from an additional six mice. Adaptation to the intestinal environment was accompanied by increases in a subset of cell signaling genes including transmembrane kinases, ras and rho family GTPases, and calcium binding proteins. Significant decreases in mRNA abundance for genes involved in glycolysis and concomitant increases in lipases were consistent with a change in energy metabolism. Defense against bacteria present in the intestine (but lacking from in vitro culture) was suggested by alterations in mRNA levels of genes similar to the AIG1 plant antibacterial proteins. Decreases in oxygen detoxification pathways were observed as expected in the anaerobic colonic lumen. Of the known virulence factors the most remarkable changes were a 20-35-fold increase in a cysteine proteinase four-like gene, and a 2-3-fold decrease in two members of the Gal/GalNAc lectin light subunit family. Control of the observed changes in mRNA abundance in the intestine might potentially rest with four related proteins with DNA binding domains that were down-regulated 6-16-fold in the intestinal environment. In conclusion, the first genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome of E. histolytica demonstrated that the vast majority of genes are transcribed in trophozoites, and that in the host intestine trophozoites altered the expression of mRNAs for genes implicated in metabolism, oxygen defense, cell signaling, virulence, antibacterial activity, and DNA binding.","['Animals', 'Colon/*parasitology', 'Dysentery, Amebic/*parasitology', 'Entamoeba histolytica/growth & development/*pathogenicity', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Proteome', 'Protozoan Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virulence']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Color', 'Ecology', 'Data acquisition', 'Histogram', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'ProteomeXchange ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
17612493,MicroRNA targeting specificity in mammals: determinants beyond seed pairing,"Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) pair to 3'UTRs of mRNAs to direct their posttranscriptional repression. Important for target recognition are approximately 7 nt sites that match the seed region of the miRNA. However, these seed matches are not always sufficient for repression, indicating that other characteristics help specify targeting. By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13-16, positioning within the 3'UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long UTRs. A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added miRNAs and for endogenous miRNA-message interactions. Because it predicts site efficacy without recourse to evolutionary conservation, the model also identifies effective nonconserved sites and siRNA off-targets.","[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Pairing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Codon, Terminator/genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mammals/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Translational medicine', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Base pairing probability matrix dotplot', 'Base-calling', 'pair', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Structure determination', 'Codon name', 'Codon number', 'Conserved transcription regulatory sequence identification', 'Protein conserved site signature', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mammals', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic map', 'Kinetic model', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'pure nucleotide', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Chemical formula']"
17947641,Lymphtoxin pathway effects on thymic medullary epithelial cells,"The lymphotoxin pathway is critical for the development and maintenance of peripheral lymphoid organs. Mice with deficiencies in members of this pathway lack lymph nodes and Peyer's patches and have abnormal spleen architecture. These animals also develop autoantibodies to and lymphocytic infiltrates of multiple organs, provoking speculation that the lymphotoxin pathway may play a role in central tolerance induction. Indeed, a series of reports has claimed that lymphotoxin signals control the expression of Aire, a transcriptional regulator that is expressed in medullary epithelial cells of the thymus, mediates ectopic transcription of genes encoding a variety of peripheral tissue Ags, and promotes clonal deletion of self-reactive thymocytes. However, one report argued that lymphotoxin signals regulate the composition and organization of the thymus, particularly of the medullary epithelial compartment. Herein, we resolve this controversy in favor of the latter view. The expression and function of Aire were unaffected in medullary epithelial cells of mice lacking either lymphotoxin beta receptor or the lymphotoxin alpha-chain, and there was minimal overlap between the sets of genes controlled by Aire and lymphotoxin. Instead, both knockout lines showed abnormal medullary epithelial cell organization, and the line lacking the beta receptor had significantly fewer medullary epithelial cells. In short, the lymphotoxin pathway drives the developmental rather than selectional properties of thymic stromal cells.","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lymphotoxin beta Receptor/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Cell line report', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Toxin name', 'C-alpha trace', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'ELAND format', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

We used a combined genomic and expression profiling approach to identify genomic regions and underlying genes that are predictive of outcome in GCT patients. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on 53 non-seminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy and defined altered genomic regions using Circular Binary Segmentation. We identified 14 regions associated with two year disease-free survival (2yDFS) and 16 regions associated with five year disease-specific survival (5yDSS). From corresponding expression data, we identified 101 probe sets that showed significant changes in expression. We built several models based on these differentially expressed genes, then tested them in an independent validation set of 54 NSGCTs. These predictive models correctly classified outcome in 64-79.6% of patients in the validation set, depending on the endpoint utilized. Survival analysis demonstrated a significant separation of patients with good versus poor predicted outcome when using a combined gene set model. Multivariate analysis using clinical risk classification with the combined gene model indicated that they were independent prognostic markers. This novel set of predictive genes from altered genomic regions is almost entirely independent of our previously identified set of predictive genes for patients with NSGCTs. These genes may aid in the identification of the small subset of patients who are at high risk of poor outcome.","['Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomics', 'Humans', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*diagnosis/*genetics']","['Comparative genomics', 'Protein modelling', 'Genome comparison', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'DNA variation', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Statistical modelling', 'Statistical calculation', 'Statistical inference', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report']"

Here we report that six exocrine peptidase precursor genes, carboxypeptidase A, trypsin precursor, trypsin like, chymotrypsinogen B1, chymotrypsinogen 1-like, and elastase 2 like, are downregulated in yquem/urod (-/-), identified initially by microarray analysis of yquem/urod zebrafish and, subsequently, confirmed by in situ hybridization. We then determined downregulation of these six zymogens specifically in the exocrine pancreas of sauternes (sau(tb223)) larvae, carrying a mutation in the gene encoding delta-amino-levulinate synthase (ALAS2), the first enzyme in heme biosynthesis. We also found that ptf1a, a transcription factor regulating exocrine zymogens, is downregulated in both yquem/urod (-/-) and sau/alas2 (-/-) larvae. Further, hemin treatment rescues expression of ptf1a and these six zymogens in both yquem/urod (-/-) and sauternes/alas2 (-/-) larvae. Thus, it appears that heme deficiency downregulates ptf1a, which, in turn, leads to downregulation of exocrine zymogens.

Subsequently, the expression of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold) in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains (P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison. Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of S. mutans through global control of gene expression.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Galactose/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Streptococcus mutans/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virulence/genetics']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biology', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'gxformat2', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'GlycoMap ID', 'GlycomeDB ID', 'Concentration', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Vienna RNA concentration data', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Monosaccharide identifier', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Protein expression', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Mutation ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
17982457,A Survey of Genetic Human Cortical Gene Expression,"It is widely assumed that genetic differences in gene expression underpin much of the difference among individuals and many of the quantitative traits of interest to geneticists. Despite this, there has been little work on genetic variability in human gene expression and almost none in the human brain, because tools for assessing this genetic variability have not been available. Now, with whole-genome SNP genotyping arrays and whole-transcriptome expression arrays, such experiments have become feasible. We have carried out whole-genome genotyping and expression analysis on a series of 193 neuropathologically normal human brain samples using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set and Illumina HumanRefseq-8 Expression BeadChip platforms. Here we present data showing that 58% of the transcriptome is cortically expressed in at least 5% of our samples and that of these cortically expressed transcripts, 21% have expression profiles that correlate with their genotype. These genetic-expression effects should be useful in determining the underlying biology of associations with common diseases of the human brain and in guiding the analysis of the genomic regions involved in the control of normal gene expression.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebral Cortex/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Sequence variations', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection']"

19587787,Association of cohesin and Nipped-B with transcriptionally active regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome,"The cohesin protein complex was first recognized for holding sister chromatids together and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Cohesin also regulates gene expression, but the mechanisms are unknown. Cohesin associates preferentially with active genes, and is generally absent from regions in which histone H3 is methylated by the Enhancer of zeste [E(z)] Polycomb group silencing protein. Here we show that transcription is hypersensitive to cohesin levels in two exceptional cases where cohesin and the E(z)-mediated histone methylation simultaneously coat the entire Enhancer of split and invected-engrailed gene complexes in cells derived from Drosophila central nervous system. These gene complexes are modestly transcribed, and produce seven of the twelve transcripts that increase the most with cohesin knockdown genome-wide. Cohesin mutations alter eye development in the same manner as increased Enhancer of split activity, suggesting that similar regulation occurs in vivo. We propose that cohesin helps restrain transcription of these gene complexes, and that deregulation of similarly cohesin-hypersensitive genes may underlie developmental deficits in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatids/*physiology', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*physiology', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'R markdown', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Protein report', 'Protein expression']"
22806141,Chromatin based modeling of transcription rates identifies the contribution of different regulatory layers to steady-state mRNA levels.,"Messenger RNA levels in eukaryotes are controlled by multiple consecutive regulatory processes, which can be classified into two layers: primary transcriptional regulation at the chromosomal level and secondary, co- and post-transcriptional regulation of the mRNA. To identify the individual contribution of these layers to steady-state RNA levels requires separate quantification. Using mouse as a model organism, we show that chromatin features are sufficient to model RNA levels but with different sensitivities in dividing versus postmitotic cells. In both cases, chromatin-derived transcription rates explain over 80% of the observed variance in measured RNA levels. Further inclusion of measurements of mRNA half-life and microRNA expression data enabled the identification of a low quantitative contribution of RNA decay by either microRNA or general differential turnover to final mRNA levels. Together, this establishes a chromatin-based quantitative model for the contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes to steady-state levels of messenger RNA.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA Stability/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Statistics and probability', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Gene transcription']"
23209434,Tissue-specific regulation of chromatin insulator function,"Chromatin insulators organize the genome into distinct transcriptional domains and contribute to cell type-specific chromatin organization. However, factors regulating tissue-specific insulator function have not yet been discovered. Here we identify the RNA recognition motif-containing protein Shep as a direct interactor of two individual components of the gypsy insulator complex in Drosophila. Mutation of shep improves gypsy-dependent enhancer blocking, indicating a role as a negative regulator of insulator activity. Unlike ubiquitously expressed core gypsy insulator proteins, Shep is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) with lower expression in other tissues. We developed a novel, quantitative tissue-specific barrier assay to demonstrate that Shep functions as a negative regulator of insulator activity in the CNS but not in muscle tissue. Additionally, mutation of shep alters insulator complex nuclear localization in the CNS but has no effect in other tissues. Consistent with negative regulatory activity, ChIP-seq analysis of Shep in a CNS-derived cell line indicates substantial genome-wide colocalization with a single gypsy insulator component but limited overlap with intact insulator complexes. Taken together, these data reveal a novel, tissue-specific mode of regulation of a chromatin insulator.","['Animals', 'Central Nervous System/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism', 'Genome', 'Insulator Elements/*genetics', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotide Motifs/genetics', '*Organ Specificity', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'RNA central ID', 'System metadata', 'Operating system name', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Mobile genetic elements', ""Ensembl ID ('Mus musculus')"", 'SMILES', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'nucleotide', 'Nucleotide code', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'Protein expression']"

However, for many ncRNAs, the targets remain to be discovered. In this study, we developed computational methods to map C/D box snoRNA target sites using data from core small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein crosslinking and immunoprecipitation and from transcriptome-wide mapping of 2΄-O-ribose methylation sites. We thereby assigned the snoRNA guide to a known methylation site in the 18S rRNA, we uncovered a novel partially methylated site in the 28S ribosomal RNA, and we captured a site in the 28S rRNA in interaction with multiple snoRNAs. Although we also captured mRNAs in interaction with snoRNAs, we did not detect 2΄-O-methylation of these targets. Our study provides an integrated approach to the comprehensive characterization of 2΄-O-methylation targets of snoRNAs in species beyond those in which these interactions have been traditionally studied and contributes to the rapidly developing field of 'epitranscriptomics'.","['*Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Databases, Genetic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Methylation', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Guide, Kinetoplastida/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 18S/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Nucleolar/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nucleolar/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribose/metabolism', 'Software', '*Transcriptome']","['Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic linkage report', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Database', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Ribosomes', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'RNA', 'RNA-Seq', 'rna', 'Proteins', 'nucleotide', 'Software engineering', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

While the plasmid shows minor divergence from that sequenced in serotype 5a, striking characteristics of the chromosome have been revealed. The S.flexneri chromosome has, astonishingly, 314 IS elements, more than 7-fold over those possessed by its close relatives, the non-pathogenic K12 strain and enterohemorrhagic O157:H7 strain of Escherichia coli. There are 13 translocations and inversions compared with the E.coli sequences, all involve a segment larger than 5 kb, and most are associated with deletions or acquired DNA sequences, of which several are likely to be bacteriophage-transmitted pathogenicity islands.

18281415,Expression data from barley maturing and germinating grains,"Plant seeds prepare for germination already during seed maturation. We performed a detailed transcriptome analysis of barley (Hordeum vulgare) grain maturation, desiccation, and germination in two tissue fractions (starchy endosperm/aleurone and embryo/scutellum) using the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip. To aid data evaluation, Arabidopsis thaliana MapMan and PageMan tools were adapted to barley. The analyses allow a number of conclusions: (1) Cluster analysis revealed a smooth transition in transcription programs between late seed maturation and germination within embryo tissues, but not in the endosperm/aleurone. (2) More than 12,000 transcripts are stored in the embryo of dry barley grains, many of which are presumably activated during germination. (3) Transcriptional activation of storage reserve mobilization events occurs at an early stage of germination, well before radicle protrusion. (4) Key genes of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis are already active during grain maturation at a time when abscisic acid peaks suggesting the formation of an endogenous store of GA in the aleurone. This GA probably acts later during germination in addition to newly synthesized GA. (5) Beside the well-known role of GA in gene activation during germination spatiotemporal expression data and cis-element searches in homologous rice promoters confirm an equally important gene-activating role of abscisic acid during this developmental period. The respective regulatory webs are linked to auxin and ethylene controlled networks. In summary, new bioinformatics PageMan and MapMan tools developed in barley have been successfully used to investigate in detail the transcriptome relationships between seed maturation and germination in an important crop plant.","['*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Germination', 'Hordeum/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Photosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Seeds/growth & development/metabolism']","['Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Structure determination', 'Recombination detection', 'Ordination plot', 'Gene order', 'GEN', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"

However, the complexity of the RNA degradome other than miRNA targets is currently largely uncharacterized, and this limits the application of RNA degradome studies. We conducted a global analysis of 5'-truncated mRNA ends that mapped to coding sequences (CDSs) of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and soybean (Glycine max). Based on this analysis, we provide multiple lines of evidence to show that the plant RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. We observed a 3-nucleotide periodicity in the position of free 5' RNA ends and a bias toward the translational frame. By examining conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of Arabidopsis and rice, we found a predominance of 5' termini of RNA degradation intermediates that were separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment. Through the analysis of RNA degradome data, we discovered uORFs and CDS regions potentially associated with stacked ribosomes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, our analysis of RNA degradome data suggested that the binding of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE7 to a noncleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement.

16333072,Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus BT 10/98 Genome sequencing and assembly,"Campylobacter fetus can be divided into the subspecies C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. fetus subsp. venerealis. C. fetus subsp. fetus causes sporadic infections in humans and abortion in cattle and sheep and has been isolated from a variety of sites in different hosts. C. fetus subsp. venerealis is host restricted, being isolated mainly from the genital tracts of cattle, and is the causative agent of bovine genital campylobacteriosis. Despite differences in niche preference, microbiological subspecies differentiation has proven difficult. Different typing methods divided C. fetus isolates into different subgroups, depending on the methods used. The relative value of these methods can be assessed by the evolutionary relationship of isolates belonging to the genus; therefore, we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for C. fetus. This scheme was applied to 140 C. fetus isolates previously typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. A total of 14 different sequence types (STs) were identified, and these exhibited low levels of inter-ST genetic diversity, with only 22 variable sites in 3,312 nucleotides. These MLST data indicate that C. fetus is genetically homogeneous compared to the homogeneity of other Campylobacter species. The two C. fetus subspecies were extremely closely related genetically, but ST-4 was associated only with C. fetus subsp. venerealis, which represents a ""bovine"" clone. The C. fetus subsp. fetus isolates studied were more diverse in terms of their STs, and the STs correlated with epidemiological relationships. Congruence was observed among C. fetus subspecies, sap type, and ST; therefore, MLST confirms that mammalian C. fetus is genetically stable, probably as result of the introduction of a single ancestral clone into a mammalian niche.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', '*Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Base Sequence', 'Campylobacter Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Campylobacter fetus/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sheep Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Species Specificity']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Genotyping', 'Genotyping experiment', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Protein interactions', 'Infectious disease', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Rare diseases', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'CHAIN', 'Sequence analysis', 'DNA', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"

JHS/EDS-HT is considered an autosomal dominant trait but is still without a defined molecular basis. The absence of (a) causative gene(s) for JHS/EDS-HT is likely attributable to marked genetic heterogeneity and/or interaction of multiple loci. In order to help in deciphering such a complex molecular background, we carried out a comprehensive immunofluorescence analysis and gene expression profiling in cultured skin fibroblasts from five women affected with JHS/EDS-HT. Protein study revealed disarray of several matrix structural components such as fibrillins, tenascins, elastin, collagens, fibronectin, and their integrin receptors. Transcriptome analysis indicated perturbation of different signaling cascades that are required for homeostatic regulation either during development or in adult tissues as well as altered expression of several genes involved in maintenance of extracellular matrix architecture and homeostasis (e.g., SPON2, TGM2, MMP16, GPC4, SULF1), cell-cell adhesion (e.g., CDH2, CHD10, PCDH9, CLDN11, FLG, DSP), immune/inflammatory/pain responses (e.g., CFD, AQP9, COLEC12, KCNQ5, PRLR), and essential for redox balance (e.g., ADH1C, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, MAOB, GSTM5).

19223442,Genome wide identification of targets of the drosha-pasha/DGCR8 complex,"Drosha is a type III RNase, which plays a critical role in miRNA biogenesis. Drosha and its double-stranded RNA-binding partner protein Pasha/DGCR8 likely recognize and cleave miRNA precursor RNAs or pri-miRNA hairpins cotranscriptionally. To identify RNAs processed by Drosha, we used tiling microarrays to examine transcripts after depletion of drosha mRNA with dsRNA in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells. This strategy identified 137 Drosha-regulated RNAs, including 11 putative pri-miRNAs comprising 15 annotated miRNAs. Most of the identified pri-miRNAs seem extremely large, >10 kb as revealed by both the Drosha knock-down strategy and by RNA PolII chromatin IP followed by Drosophila tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, more than a hundred additional RNAs not annotated as miRNAs are under Drosha control and are likely to be direct targets of Drosha action. This is because many of them encode annotated genes, and unlike bona fide pri-miRNAs, they are not affected by depletion of the miRNA processing factor, dicer-1. Moreover, application of the evofold analysis software indicates that at least 25 of the Drosha-regulated RNAs contain evolutionarily conserved hairpins similar to those recognized by the Drosha-Pasha/DGCR8 complex in pri-miRNAs. One of these hairpins is located in the 5' UTR of both pasha and mammalian DGCR8. These observations suggest that a negative feedback loop acting on pasha mRNA may regulate the miRNA-biogenesis pathway: i.e., excess Drosha cleaves pasha/DGCR8 primary transcripts and leads to a reduction in pasha/DGCR8 mRNA levels and Pasha/DGCR8 synthesis.","[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genome, Insect', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/chemistry/*metabolism']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Translational medicine', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Gene ID', 'R markdown', 'Genome map', 'Genome index', 'Genome report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Protein complex', 'Multiple protein sequence alignment', 'Protein-ligand complex', 'Protein binding sites', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Ribosome Profiling']"
27181871,Calanus finmarchicus adult female transcriptome of Alexandrium fundyense response,"In the Gulf of Maine, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus co-occurs with the neurotoxin-producing dinoflagellate, Alexandrium fundyense. The copepod is resistant to this toxic alga, but little is known about other effects. Gene expression profiles were used to investigate the physiological response of females feeding for two and five days on a control diet or a diet containing either a low or a high dose of A. fundyense. The physiological responses to the two experimental diets were similar, but changed between the time points. At 5-days the response was characterized by down-regulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Detoxification was not a major component of the response. Instead, genes involved in digestion were consistently regulated, suggesting that food assimilation may have been affected. Thus, predicted increases in the frequency of blooms of A. fundyense could affect C. finmarchicus populations by changing the individuals' energy budget and reducing their ability to build lipid reserves.","['Animals', 'Arthropod Proteins/genetics', 'Copepoda/*genetics/*physiology', 'Diet', 'Dinoflagellida/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Saxitoxin/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transcriptome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'codata', 'NET', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'MAT', 'Toxin name', 'Toxin structure', 'Toxin accession', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

Through the development and refinement of a transgenic rat model of malignant hypertension incorporating the mouse renin gene, we previously identified a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 10, which affects malignant hypertension severity and morbidity. We next generated an inducible malignant hypertensive model where the timing, severity, and duration of hypertension was placed under the control of the researcher, allowing development of and recovery from end organ damage to be investigated. We have now generated novel consomic Lewis and Fischer rat strains with inducible hypertension and additional strains that are reciprocally congenic for the refined chromosome 10 quantitative trait locus. We have captured a modifier of end organ damage within the congenic region and, using a range of bioinformatic, biochemical and molecular biological techniques, have identified angiotensin-converting enzyme as the modifier of hypertension-induced tissue microvascular injury. Reciprocal differences between angiotensin-converting enzyme and the anti-inflammatory tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro in the kidney, a tissue susceptible to end organ damage, suggest a mechanism for the amelioration of hypertension-dependent damage.","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Arteries/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Hypertension, Malignant/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Mice', 'Microcirculation', 'Pancreas/pathology', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rats', 'Renal Circulation', 'Renin/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Article', 'Chromosomes', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'File name extension', 'HTML', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Alignment', 'Protein function prediction', 'Function analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Calculation', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Simulation', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide annotation', 'Quantitative trait locus', 'QTL map', 'Phylogenetic continuous quantitative data', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Retention time prediction', 'Statistical calculation']"
17965166,Transcriptome dynamics during the transition from anaerobic photosynthesis to aerobic respiration in R. sphaeroides,"Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 is a facultative photosynthetic anaerobe that grows by anoxygenic photosynthesis under anaerobic-light conditions. Changes in energy generation pathways under photosynthetic and aerobic respiratory conditions are primarily controlled by oxygen tensions. In this study, we performed time series microarray analyses to investigate transcriptome dynamics during the transition from anaerobic photosynthesis to aerobic respiration. Major changes in gene expression profiles occurred in the initial 15 min after the shift from anaerobic-light to aerobic-dark conditions, with changes continuing to occur up to 4 hours postshift. Those genes whose expression levels changed significantly during the time series were grouped into three major classes by clustering analysis. Class I contained genes, such as that for the aa3 cytochrome oxidase, whose expression levels increased after the shift. Class II contained genes, such as those for the photosynthetic apparatus and Calvin cycle enzymes, whose expression levels decreased after the shift. Class III contained genes whose expression levels temporarily increased during the time series. Many genes for metabolism and transport of carbohydrates or lipids were significantly induced early during the transition, suggesting that those endogenous compounds were initially utilized as carbon sources. Oxidation of those compounds might also be required for maintenance of redox homeostasis after exposure to oxygen. Genes for the repair of protein and sulfur groups and uptake of ferric iron were temporarily upregulated soon after the shift, suggesting they were involved in a response to oxidative stress. The flagellar-biosynthesis genes were expressed in a hierarchical manner at 15 to 60 min after the shift. Numerous transporters were induced at various time points, suggesting that the cellular composition went through significant changes during the transition from anaerobic photosynthesis to aerobic respiration. Analyses of these data make it clear that numerous regulatory activities come into play during the transition from one homeostatic state to another.","['Aerobiosis', 'Anaerobiosis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', '*Genes, Bacterial', 'Kinetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxygen Consumption/*physiology', 'Photosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rhodobacter sphaeroides/*genetics']","['Microbiology', 'Analysis', 'Protein analysis', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'geneseq', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Training material', 'Enzyme kinetics data', 'Genetics', 'Kinetic model', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Consensus tree construction', 'Generation', 'consensus', 'Synthetic biology', 'Synthetic chemistry', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence']"
19088304,hsa-mir-26b and hsa-mir-98 overexpression,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression by inducing RNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Most human miRNAs are intragenic and are transcribed as part of their hosting transcription units. We hypothesized that the expression profiles of miRNA host genes and of their targets are inversely correlated and devised a novel procedure, HOCTAR (host gene oppositely correlated targets), which ranks predicted miRNA target genes based on their anti-correlated expression behavior relative to their respective miRNA host genes. HOCTAR is the first tool for systematic miRNA target prediction that utilizes the same set of microarray experiments to monitor the expression of both miRNAs (through their host genes) and candidate targets. We applied the procedure to 178 human intragenic miRNAs and found that it performs better than currently available prediction softwares in pinpointing previously validated miRNA targets. The high-scoring HOCTAR predicted targets were enriched in Gene Ontology categories, which were consistent with previously published data, as in the case of miR-106b and miR-93. By means of overexpression and loss-of-function assays, we also demonstrated that HOCTAR is efficient in predicting novel miRNA targets and we identified, by microarray and qRT-PCR procedures, 34 and 28 novel targets for miR-26b and miR-98, respectively. Overall, we believe that the use of HOCTAR significantly reduces the number of candidate miRNA targets to be tested compared to the procedures based solely on target sequence recognition. Finally, our data further confirm that miRNAs have a significant impact on the mRNA levels of most of their targets.","['Algorithms', 'Forecasting/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/*physiology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods']","['Formatting', 'Sequence formatting', 'DNA testing', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Read mapping', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis']"
27919081,Analysis of differential gene expression in Drosophila dIME4 null mutants [paired-end],"N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) and is decoded by YTH domain proteins. The mammalian mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer (Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However, the functions of m<sup>6</sup>A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain uncertain. Here we show that m<sup>6</sup>A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness. This is because m<sup>6</sup>A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We further show that the m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein YT521-B decodes m<sup>6</sup>A in the sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. Loss of m<sup>6</sup>A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly in the 5' untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of metabolic genes. The requirement of m<sup>6</sup>A and its reader YT521-B for female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels of gene expression.","[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Drosophila Proteins/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics', 'Female', 'Introns/genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Determination Processes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['DNA translation', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Coding region', 'RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic code', 'Genetic codes and codon usage', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Introns', 'ASTD ID (intron)', 'Protein interactions', 'MAT', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Ancestral reconstruction', 'Phylogenetic character data', 'Sequence mask character', 'Structure determination', 'Recombination detection', 'Annotation processing', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"

Genetic association studies have identified sequence variants in the gene BCL11A that influence HbF levels. Here, we examine BCL11A as a potential regulator of HbF expression. The high-HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the beta-globin gene cluster. BCL11A emerges as a therapeutic target for reactivation of HbF in beta-hemoglobin disorders.","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hemoglobinopathies/therapy', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'gamma-Globins/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'BLAST XML results format', 'Cell type accession', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene expression', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'cel', 'Protein complex', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Protein ID (CORUM)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Protein domains', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'Protein report format', 'Protein data', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Protein report', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Beta diversity data', 'Protein globularity', 'Gamma diversity data']"
19151323,Transcriptional response of Candida parapsilosis in low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions in SD media,"The ability of Candida parapsilosis to form biofilms on indwelling medical devices is correlated with virulence. To identify genes that are important for biofilm formation, we used arrays representing approximately 4,000 open reading frames (ORFs) to compare the transcriptional profile of biofilm cells growing in a microfermentor under continuous flow conditions with that of cells in planktonic culture. The expression of genes involved in fatty acid and ergosterol metabolism and in glycolysis, is upregulated in biofilms. The transcriptional profile of C. parapsilosis biofilm cells resembles that of Candida albicans cells grown under hypoxic conditions. We therefore subsequently used whole-genome arrays (representing 5,900 ORFs) to determine the hypoxic response of C. parapsilosis and showed that the levels of expression of genes involved in the ergosterol and glycolytic pathways, together with several cell wall genes, are increased. Our results indicate that there is substantial overlap between the hypoxic responses of C. parapsilosis and C. albicans and that this may be important for biofilm development. Knocking out an ortholog of the cell wall gene RBT1, whose expression is induced both in biofilms and under conditions of hypoxia in C. parapsilosis, reduces biofilm development.","['*Biofilms', 'Candida/genetics/*physiology', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Oxygen/*metabolism']","['BioJSON (BioXSD)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'GEN']"

23966866,Mediator directs co-transcriptional heterochromatin assembly by RNAi-dependent and -independent pathways.,"Heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats in fission yeast is assembled and spread by an RNAi-dependent mechanism, which is coupled with the transcription of non-coding RNA from the repeats by RNA polymerase II. In addition, Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, also contributes to heterochromatin assembly and is coupled with non-coding RNA transcription. The multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, has recently been suggested to function after initiation in processes such as elongation of transcription and splicing. However, the role of Mediator in the regulation of chromatin structure is not well understood. We investigated the role of Mediator in pericentromeric heterochromatin formation and found that deletion of specific subunits of the head domain of Mediator compromised heterochromatin structure. The Mediator head domain was required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin nucleation at the pericentromere and for RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin into the neighboring region. In the latter process, Mediator appeared to contribute to efficient processing of siRNA from transcribed non-coding RNA, which was required for efficient spreading of heterochromatin. Furthermore, the head domain directed efficient transcription in heterochromatin. These results reveal a pivotal role for Mediator in multiple steps of transcription-coupled formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. This observation further extends the role of Mediator to co-transcriptional chromatin regulation.","['Centromere/genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Heterochromatin/*genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics/metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*genetics', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['RNA central ID', 'Concentration', 'Phylogenetic inference (data centric)', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecule data processing', 'Small molecules', 'DNA translation', 'Translational medicine', 'DNA back-translation', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'MonosaccharideDB ID', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

However, ∼20% of MCC tumors do not have detectable MCV, suggesting alternative etiologies for this tumor type. In this study, our aim was to evaluate microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles and their associations with MCV status and clinical outcomes in MCC. We showed that miRNA expression profiles were distinct between MCV-positive (MCV+) and MCV-negative (MCV-) MCCs and further validated that miR-203, miR-30a-3p, miR-769-5p, miR-34a, miR-30a-5p, and miR-375 were significantly different. We also identified a subset of miRNAs associated with tumor metastasis and MCC-specific survival. Functionally, overexpression of miR-203 was found to inhibit cell growth, induce cell cycle arrest, and regulate survivin expression in MCV- MCC cells, but not in MCV+ MCC cells.

Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-κB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC).

30300363,Divergence of macrophage phagocytic and antimicrobial programs in leprosy,"Following infection, virulent mycobacteria persist and grow within the macrophage, suggesting that the intrinsic activation of an innate antimicrobial response is subverted by the intracellular pathogen. For Mycobacterium leprae, the intracellular bacterium that causes leprosy, the addition of exogenous innate or adaptive immune ligands to the infected monocytes/macrophages was required to detect a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial activity. We investigated whether there is an intrinsic immune response to M. leprae in macrophages that is inhibited by the pathogen. Upon infection of monocytes with M. leprae, there was no upregulation of CYP27B1 nor its enzymatic activity converting the inactive prohormone form of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) to the bioactive form (1,25α-dihydroxyvitamin D). Given that M. leprae-induced type I interferon (IFN) inhibited monocyte activation, we blocked the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), revealing the intrinsic capacity of monocytes to recognize M. leprae and upregulate CYP27B1. Consistent with these in vitro studies, an inverse relationship between expression of CYP27B1 vs. type I IFN downstream gene OAS1 was detected in leprosy patient lesions, leading us to study cytokine-derived macrophages (MΦ) to model cellular responses at the site of disease. Infection of IL-15-derived MΦ, similar to MΦ in lesions from the self-limited form of leprosy, with M. leprae did not inhibit induction of the vitamin D antimicrobial pathway. In contrast, infection of IL-10-derived MΦ, similar to MΦ in lesions from patients with the progressive form of leprosy, resulted in induction of type I IFN and suppression of the vitamin D directed pathway. Importantly, blockade of the type I IFN response in infected IL-10 MΦ decreased M. leprae viability. These results indicate that M. leprae evades the intrinsic capacity of human monocytes/MΦ to activate the vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial pathway via the induction of type I IFN.","['25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Immune Evasion', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Mycobacterium leprae/immunology/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology']","['Protein hydropathy', 'Protein hydropathy data', 'Amino acid index (hydropathy)', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunomics', 'Immunology', 'DNA barcoding', 'Date', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Type', 'Map type', 'Sequence type', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression']"

Indoxyl sulfate-exposed mice with microalbuminuria showed ischemic changes, while more severely affected mice showed increased mesangial matrix, segmental solidification, and mesangiolysis. In normal mouse kidneys, AhR was predominantly localized to the podocyte nuclei. In mice exposed to indoxyl sulfate for 2 h, isolated glomeruli manifested increased Cyp1a1 expression, indicating AhR activation. After 8 w of indoxyl sulfate, podocytes showed foot process effacement, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and a focal granular and wrinkled pattern of podocin and synaptopodin expression. Furthermore, vimentin and AhR expression in the glomerulus was increased in the indoxyl sulfate-exposed glomeruli compared to controls. Glomerular expression of characteristic podocyte mRNAs was decreased, including Actn4, Cd2ap, Myh9, Nphs1, Nphs2, Podxl, Synpo, and Wt1. In vitro, immortalized-mouse podocytes exhibited AhR nuclear translocation beginning 30 min after 1 mM indoxyl sulfate exposure, and there was increased phospho-Rac1/Cdc42 at 2 h. After exposure to indoxyl sulfate for 24 h, mouse podocytes exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, perturbed actin cytoskeleton, decreased expression of podocyte-specific genes, and decreased cell viability. In immortalized human podocytes, indoxyl sulfate treatment caused cell injury, decreased mRNA expression of podocyte-specific proteins, as well as integrins, collagens, cytoskeletal proteins, and bone morphogenetic proteins, and increased cytokine and chemokine expression. We propose that basal levels of AhR activity regulate podocyte function under normal conditions, and that increased activation of podocyte AhR by indoxyl sulfate contributes to progressive glomerular injury.","['Animals', 'Indican/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Kidney/blood supply/drug effects', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Podocytes/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'InterProScan XML', 'Ligand identifier', 'HET group name', 'KEGG LIGAND entry format', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Carbohydrate report', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Carbohydrates']"
25078263,microRNAs profiling in hippocampal cells of mouse with Sound-induced Seizure,"Epilepsy affects around 50 million people worldwide, and in about 65% of patients, the etiology of disease is unknown. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Here, we compared microRNA expression patterns in the hippocampus using two chronic models of epilepsy characterised by recurrent spontaneous seizures (pilocarpine and self-sustained status epilepticus (SSSE)) and an acute 6-Hz seizure model. The vast majority of microRNAs deregulated in the acute model exhibited increased expression with 146 microRNAs up-regulated within 6 h after a single seizure. In contrast, in the chronic models, the number of up-regulated microRNAs was similar to the number of down-regulated microRNAs. Three microRNAs-miR-142-5p, miR-331-3p and miR-30a-5p-were commonly deregulated in all three models. However, there is a clear overlap of differentially expressed microRNAs within the chronic models with 36 and 15 microRNAs co-regulated at 24 h and at 28 days following status epilepticus, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the altered microRNAs are associated with inflammation, innate immunity and cell cycle regulation. Taken together, the identified microRNAs and the pathways they modulate might represent candidates for novel molecular approaches for the treatment of patients with epilepsy.","['Animals', 'Genes, cdc', 'Hippocampus/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Seizures/*genetics/metabolism', 'Status Epilepticus/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'DNA barcoding', 'Immunogenicity prediction', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Sequence features', 'Job status', 'Epistasis']"
24551121,Liver mRNA microarray study for mice treated with various diets,"Nutritional intake is a fundamental determinant of health. Many studies have correlated excess caloric intake, as well as a high ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids, with detrimental health outcomes, such as the metabolic syndrome. In contrast, low-calorie diets have beneficial health effects. Despite these associations, our understanding of the causal relationship between diet and health remains largely elusive. The present study examined the molecular changes elicited by nine diets with varying fat, sugar, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and calories in C57BL/6 male mice. Microarray analyses were conducted on liver samples from three mice per diet and detected 20,449 genes of which 3,734 were responsive to changes in dietary components. Principal component analysis showed that diet restriction correlated the least with the other diets and also affected more genes than any other diet. Interestingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified gene sets involved in glutathione metabolism, immune response, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, ABC transporters, and oxidative phosphorylation as being highly responsive to changes in diet composition. On the gene level, this study reveals novel findings such as the induction of the drug efflux pump Abcb1a (p-glycoprotein) by diet restriction and an atherogenic diet, as well as the suppression of the rate limiting step of bile acid synthesis, Cyp7a1, by a high fructose diet. This study provides considerable insight into the molecular changes incurred by a variety of diets and furthers our understanding of the causal relationships between diet and health.","['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/genetics', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Diet', 'Fatty Acids/biosynthesis', 'Fatty Liver/complications/*genetics/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Inflammation/complications/*genetics', 'Lipid Metabolism/*genetics', 'Liver/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oxidative Stress/*genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Software', 'Transcriptome/genetics']","['Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor binding site prediction', 'RNA binding site prediction', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Pathway ID (Panther)', 'Synthetic biology', 'Panther Pathways entry format', 'Analysis', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene cluster', 'NET', 'Nucleic acids', 'Peptides and amino acids', 'Fate map', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Epistasis', 'Information extraction', 'Version information', 'Sequence version', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'IDAT', 'Principal component analysis', 'Principal component visualisation', 'Essential dynamics', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Software engineering', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"
28241141,ENL Links Histone Acetylation to Oncogenic Gene Expression in AML,"Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.","['*Acetylation', 'Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Editing', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Systems biology', 'Systems medicine', 'System metadata', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Editing', 'Sequence editing', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Critical care medicine', 'Analysis', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Oncology', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'PCR experiment', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

However, the analysis of nCounter data is hampered because most methods developed are based on t-tests, which do not fit the count data generated by the NanoString nCounter system. Furthermore, data normalization procedures of current methods are either not suitable for counts or not specific for NanoString nCounter data. We develop a novel DE detection method based on NanoString nCounter data. The method, named NanoStringDiff, considers a generalized linear model of the negative binomial family to characterize count data and allows for multifactor design. Data normalization is incorporated in the model framework through data normalization parameters, which are estimated from positive controls, negative controls and housekeeping genes embedded in the nCounter system. We propose an empirical Bayes shrinkage approach to estimate the dispersion parameter in the model and a likelihood ratio test to identify differentially expressed genes.

Although this minigene is present in the transgenes as a secondcistron, and thus not thought to be expressed, we found that three commonly used lines, Pdx1-Cre(Late), RIP-Cre, and MIP-GFP, each expressed significant amounts of hGH in pancreatic islets. Locally secreted hGH binds to prolactin receptors on β cells, activates STAT5 signaling, and induces pregnancy-like changes in gene expression, thereby augmenting pancreatic β cell mass and insulin content. In addition, islets of Pdx1-Cre(Late) mice have lower GLUT2 expression and reduced glucose-induced insulin release and are protected against the β cell toxin streptozotocin. These findings may be important when interpreting results obtained when these and other hGH minigene-containing transgenic mice are used.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Prolactin/genetics/metabolism', 'Tryptophan Hydroxylase/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'Gene transcription', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Protein interaction data']"

We report a C. rubella reference genome sequence and compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor Capsella grandiflora. We found a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes, similar to that seen in Arabidopsis, in which self fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago. Comparisons of the two Capsella species showed evidence of rapid genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection in C. rubella without a concomitant change in transposable element abundance.

To evaluate the applicability of HMGB2 in the early detection of carcinogenicity of chemicals using animal models, we examined HMGB2 expression in prostate of rats. Six-week-old male F344 rats were gavaged for four weeks with a total of eight individual chemicals, divided into two categories based on prostate carcinogenicity. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the study and HMGB2 immunohistochemistry was performed. HMGB2 expression in least one prostate lobe was significantly increased by all four prostate carcinogens compared with the controls. In contrast, the four chemicals that were not carcinogenic in the prostate did not cause HMGB2 up-regulation. Additionally, high HMGB2 expression in neoplastic lesions in both rat and human was detected. Therefore HMGB2 expression may be a good screening tool for the identification of potential of prostate carcinogens.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/*genetics', 'Carcinogens/*analysis', '*Early Detection of Cancer', '*Gene Expression', 'HMGB2 Protein/*analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Up-Regulation']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Pathogens', 'Selection detection', 'Format detection', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Gene regulation', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Regular expression']"

These macrophages promoted fibroblast invasiveness in an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent manner, indicating that intercellular cross-talk in this inflamed setting reshapes both cell types and contributes to fibroblast-mediated joint destruction. In an ex vivo synovial tissue assay, most medications used to treat RA patients targeted HBEGF<sup>+</sup> inflammatory macrophages; however, in some cases, medication redirected them into a state that is not expected to resolve inflammation.

25770429,Myeolchi-aekjeot Targeted Locus (Loci),"Myeolchi-aekjeot (MA) is a Korean traditional fish sauce, made by fermenting salted [approximately 25% (w/v)] anchovies. Three sets of MA samples, S-MA, M-MA, and L-MA, were prepared using small (5-8 cm), medium (8-10 cm), and large (10-13 cm) anchovies, respectively, and their bacterial communities and metabolites were investigated for 280 days. Bacterial community analysis using pyrosequencing revealed that, in S-MA, the initially dominant genera, including Phychrobacter, Photobacterium, and Vibrio, disappeared rapidly and Salinivibrio, Staphylococcus, and Tetragenococcus/Halanaerobium appeared sequentially as the major populations. In contrast, in M-MA and L-MA, the initially dominant genera were maintained relatively well during the early fermentation period, but eventually Tetragenococcus became predominant without the growth of Halanaerobium. The changes in the bacterial community occurred more quickly in MA prepared with smaller anchovies than in those prepared with larger anchovies. Metabolite analysis using (1)H NMR showed that amino acids, glycerol, acetate, and lactate rapidly increased in all MA samples during the early fermentation period. Amino acids increased more quickly and then decreased after reaching their maximum level in S-MA, while they increased continually until the end of fermentation in L-MA. This suggests that the complete fermentation of L-MA may require more time than that for S-MA.

The virulence of Vibrio strains, mostly isolated from vibriosis outbreaks in farmed fish, was tested in larval challenge trials with cod (Gadus morhua), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) using a multiwell dish assays with single-egg/larvae cultures. The strains differed significantly in virulence as some caused a high mortality of larva reaching 100% mortality after a few days, while others had no or only marginal effects on survival. Some Vibrio strains were pathogenic in all of the larva species, while some caused disease only in one of the species. Twenty-nine of the Vibrio anguillarum strains increased the mortality of larvae from at least one fish species; however, pathogenicity of the strains differed markedly. Other Vibrio species had no or less pronounced effects on larval mortalities. Iron uptake has been related to V. anguillarum virulence; however, the presence or absence of the plasmid pJM1 encoding anguibactin did not correlate with virulence. The genomes of V. anguillarum were compared (D. Castillo, P.W. D'Alvise, M. Middelboe & L.

28890333,Transcription and chromatin profiling in differentiating THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 derived macrophages,"The three-dimensional arrangement of the human genome comprises a complex network of structural and regulatory chromatin loops important for coordinating changes in transcription during human development. To better understand the mechanisms underlying context-specific 3D chromatin structure and transcription during cellular differentiation, we generated comprehensive in situ Hi-C maps of DNA loops in human monocytes and differentiated macrophages. We demonstrate that dynamic looping events are regulatory rather than structural in nature and uncover widespread coordination of dynamic enhancer activity at preformed and acquired DNA loops. Enhancer-bound loop formation and enhancer activation of preformed loops together form multi-loop activation hubs at key macrophage genes. Activation hubs connect 3.4 enhancers per promoter and exhibit a strong enrichment for activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding events, suggesting that multi-loop activation hubs involving cell-type-specific transcription factors represent an important class of regulatory chromatin structures for the spatiotemporal control of transcription.","['Binding Sites', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']","['Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Assembly', 'Sequence assembly', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid data', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'protein', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor name', 'Retention time prediction', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Analysis of the host transcriptome from infected muscle tissues indicated that many genes were upregulated compared to the results seen with mock-infected mice. These genes were enriched for host defense pathways, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Nod-like receptor (NLR) signaling components. Real-time PCR confirmed that host TLR2 and NLRP3 inflammasome genes were induced in response to <i>C. perfringens</i> infection. Comparison of the transcriptome of <i>C. perfringens</i> cells from the infected tissues with that from broth cultures showed that host selective pressure induced a global change in <i>C. perfringens</i> gene expression.

28593990,Loss of Asxl2 leads to myeloid malignancies in mice. [ChIP-Seq],"ASXL2 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukaemia patients with t(8;21). However, the roles of ASXL2 in normal haematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies remain unknown. Here we show that deletion of Asxl2 in mice leads to the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like disease. Asxl2<sup>-/-</sup> mice have an increased bone marrow (BM) long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors compared with wild-type controls. Recipients transplanted with Asxl2<sup>-/-</sup> and Asxl2<sup>+/-</sup> BM cells have shortened lifespan due to the development of MDS-like disease or myeloid leukaemia. Paired daughter cell assays demonstrate that Asxl2 loss enhances the self-renewal of HSCs. Deletion of Asxl2 alters the expression of genes critical for HSC self-renewal, differentiation and apoptosis in Lin<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> cells. The altered gene expression is associated with dysregulated H3K27ac and H3K4me1/2.

28174237,"We provide single cell transcriptomes from the placental-uterine interface. Tissue was collected at term C-section (no labor) from two healthy pregnancies, from villous part of the placenta. Cells were disassociated and processed using Fluidigm technology. RNA-seq was performed on RNA from 33+54 single cells, at approx. 3.5 mio paired reads per cell. Clustering resulted in 4 trophoblast and a single immune cell clusters. As the placenta is an epitome of cell signaling, we combined the present cell-level transcriptomes with uterine cell transcriptomes to study the potential inter-cell communication. To this end, we inferred the cell-cell-interactome by assessing the gene expression of receptor-ligand pairs across cell types. We find among the signals transmitted a predominance of growth and immune signals, and suggest a delicate balance of enhancing and suppressive signals. Finally, this study provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles of term intravillous and extravillous trophoblasts.
Single cell mRNA-seq of placenta from two term healthy pregnancies.","Organismal function is, to a great extent, determined by interactions among their fundamental building blocks, the cells. In this work, we studied the cell-cell interactome of fetal placental trophoblast cells and maternal endometrial stromal cells, using single-cell transcriptomics. The placental interface mediates the interaction between two semiallogenic individuals, the mother and the fetus, and is thus the epitome of cell interactions. To study these, we inferred the cell-cell interactome by assessing the gene expression of receptor-ligand pairs across cell types. We find a highly cell-type-specific expression of G-protein-coupled receptors, implying that ligand-receptor profiles could be a reliable tool for cell type identification. Furthermore, we find that uterine decidual cells represent a cell-cell interaction hub with a large number of potential incoming and outgoing signals. Decidual cells differentiate from their precursors, the endometrial stromal fibroblasts, during uterine preparation for pregnancy. We show that decidualization (even in vitro) enhances the ability to communicate with the fetus, as most of the receptors and ligands up-regulated during decidualization have their counterpart expressed in trophoblast cells. Among the signals transmitted, growth factors and immune signals dominate, and suggest a delicate balance of enhancing and suppressive signals.

28287392,"Pioneer transcription factors are able to recognise and bind their motif sequences in inaccessible or closed chromatin, and their ability to achieve this is required to establish new regulatory elements and transcriptional networks during development and cellular reprogramming. An essential feature of this pioneering activity is the transition from inaccessible chromatin to a nucleosome-depleted and accessible chromatin state typical of normal regulatory elements, and this is believed to facilitate further transcription factor binding events. However, the mechanisms by which many pioneer transcription factors achieve this remarkable feat remain elusive. Here we reveal that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds inaccessible chromatin to shape the chromatin accessibility, transcription factor co-binding and regulatory potential of thousands of distal regulatory elements in mouse embryonic stem cells, demonstrating that its pioneering activity is a feature of normal pluripotency, and not just reprogramming. The accessible chromatin formed at OCT4 binding sites relies on the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4. The occupancy of BRG1 is then required to support OCT4/SOX2 co-binding and normal expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome, and this reliance on BRG1 reflects OCT4 binding dynamics during cellular reprograming and early mouse development. Together these observations reveal a distinct requirement for the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1 in shaping the pioneering activity of OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network in embryonic stem cells.
ZHBTC4 and Brg1fl/fl mouse embryonic stem cells were used to ablate OCT4 and BRG1 expression respectively, followed by ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq or RNA-seq to examine their contribution towards chromatin accessibility, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression.","Pioneer transcription factors recognise and bind their target sequences in inaccessible chromatin to establish new transcriptional networks throughout development and cellular reprogramming. During this process, pioneer factors establish an accessible chromatin state to facilitate additional transcription factor binding, yet it remains unclear how different pioneer factors achieve this. Here, we discover that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds chromatin to shape accessibility, transcription factor co-binding, and regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. Furthermore, the requirement for BRG1 in shaping OCT4 binding reflects how these target sites are used during cellular reprogramming and early mouse development. Together this reveals a distinct requirement for a chromatin remodeller in promoting the activity of the pioneer factor OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network.","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Helical net', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"
26283765,Whole-genome comparison uncovers genomic mutations between group B streptococci sampled from infected newborns and their mothers,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus or GBS), a commensal of the human gut and genitourinary tract, is a leading cause of neonatal infections, in which vertical transmission from mother to child remains the most frequent route of contamination. Here, we investigated whether the progression of GBS from carriage to disease is associated with genomic adaptation. Whole-genome comparison of 47 GBS samples from 19 mother-child pairs uncovered 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and seven insertions/deletions. Of the SNPs detected, 16 appear to have been fixed in the population sampled whereas five mutations were found to be polymorphic. In the infant strains, 14 mutations were detected, including two independently fixed variants affecting the covRS locus, which is known to encode a major regulatory system of virulence. A one-nucleotide insertion was also identified in the promoter region of the highly immunogenic surface protein Rib gene. Gene expression analysis after incubation in human blood showed that these mutations influenced the expression of virulence-associated genes. Additional identification of three mutated strains in the mothers' milk raised the possibility of the newborns also being a source of contamination for their mothers. Overall, our work showed that GBS strains in carriage and disease scenarios might undergo adaptive changes following colonization. The types and locations of the mutations found, together with the experimental results showing their phenotypic impact, suggest that those in a context of infection were positively selected during the transition of GBS from commensal to pathogen, contributing to an increased capacity to cause disease.","['Adult', 'Female', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', '*Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*microbiology', 'Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology/transmission', 'Streptococcus agalactiae/*genetics']","['Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Disease transmission analysis', 'Infectious disease', 'Infectious tropical disease', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'nucleotide', 'Amplification detection']"
29233944,Ethylene promotes root hair growth through coordinated EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 activity in Arabidopsis,"Root hairs are an extensive structure of root epidermal cells and are critical for nutrient acquisition, soil anchorage, and environmental interactions in sessile plants. The phytohormone ethylene (ET) promotes root hair growth and also mediates the effects of different signals that stimulate hair cell development. However, the molecular basis of ET-induced root hair growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ET-activated transcription factor ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) physically interacts with ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6), a well-documented positive regulator of hair cells, and that the two factors directly coactivate the hair length-determining gene <i>RHD6-LIKE 4</i> (<i>RSL4</i>) to promote root hair elongation. Transcriptome analysis further revealed the parallel roles of the regulator pairs EIN3/EIL1 (EIN3-LIKE 1) and RHD6/RSL1 (RHD6-LIKE 1). EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 coordinately enhance root hair initiation by selectively regulating a subset of core root hair genes. Thus, our work reveals a key transcriptional complex consisting of EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 in the control of root hair initiation and elongation, and provides a molecular framework for the integration of environmental signals and intrinsic regulators in modulating plant organ development.","['Arabidopsis/genetics/*growth & development', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ethylenes/*pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plant Roots/*growth & development', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription', 'DNA binding sites', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'DNA methylation', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term']"

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by Dicers from RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcripts are thought to guide sequence-specific DNA methylation. To gain insight into the mechanism of RdDM, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of a collection of Arabidopsis mutants, including plants deficient in Pol IV (nrpd1) or Dicer (dcl1/2/3/4) activity. Unexpectedly, of the RdDM target loci that required Pol IV and/or Pol V, only 16% were fully dependent on Dicer activity. DNA methylation was partly or completely independent of Dicer activity at the remaining Pol IV- and/or Pol V-dependent loci, despite the loss of 24-nt siRNAs. Instead, DNA methylation levels correlated with the accumulation of Pol IV-dependent 25-50 nt RNAs at most loci in Dicer mutant plants. Our results suggest that RdDM in plants is largely guided by a previously unappreciated class of Dicer-independent non-coding RNAs, and that siRNAs are required to maintain DNA methylation at only a subset of loci.","['Arabidopsis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Plant/genetics', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'RNA, Plant/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/genetics/*metabolism']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Cell cycle', 'protein', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Plant biology', 'DNA', 'dna', 'PCR experiment', 'DNA polymorphism', 'RNA', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Gene ID', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'rna', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecule data processing', 'Small molecules', 'Ribosome Profiling']"

We investigated changes in the clinical and molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii over a 10-year period. We compared the data from 2 prospective multicenter cohort studies in Spain, one performed in 2000 (183 patients) and one in 2010 (246 patients), which included consecutive patients infected or colonized by A. baumannii. Molecular typing was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The incidence density of A. baumannii colonization or infection increased significantly from 0.14 in 2000 to 0.52 in 2010 in medical services (p < 0.001). The number of non-nosocomial health care-associated cases increased from 1.2% to 14.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). Previous exposure to carbapenems increased in 2010 (16.9% in 2000 vs 27.3% in 2010, p = 0.03). The drugs most frequently used for definitive treatment of patients with infections were carbapenems in 2000 (45%) and colistin in 2010 (50.3%). There was molecular-typing evidence of an increase in the frequency of A. baumannii acquisition in non-intensive care unit wards in 2010 (7.6% in 2000 vs 19.2% in 2010, p = 0.01). By MSLT, the ST2 clonal group predominated and increased in 2010. This epidemic clonal group was more frequently resistant to imipenem and was associated with an increased risk of sepsis, although not with severe sepsis or mortality. Some significant changes were noted in the epidemiology of A. baumannii, which is increasingly affecting patients admitted to conventional wards and is also the cause of non-nosocomial health care-associated infections. Epidemic clones seem to combine antimicrobial resistance and the ability to spread, while maintaining their clinical virulence.","['*Acinetobacter Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Acinetobacter baumannii/classification/drug effects/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Carbapenems/*pharmacology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin/*pharmacology', 'Colony Count, Microbial/methods', '*Cross Infection/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology/physiopathology', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spain/epidemiology']","['Protein interactions', 'Protein-nucleic acid interactions', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Sequence tagged sites', 'Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Genotyping', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Statistical calculation', 'ID list', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbiology', 'Selection detection', 'Infectious disease', 'Information extraction', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Drug report', 'Antimicrobial resistance prediction', 'Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Incident curve plotting', 'Sequence identity', 'Evidence', 'MAT', 'Pain medicine', 'Protein chain', 'SPARQL']"
30472158,IKZF2 is required for myeloid leukemic stem cells by driving self-renewal and inhibiting the myeloid differentiation program I,"Leukemias exhibit a dysregulated developmental program mediated through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Although IKZF2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we found that it is dispensable for mouse and human HSC function. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in hypodiploid B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we found that IKZF2 is required for myeloid leukemia. IKZF2 is highly expressed in leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and its deficiency results in defective LSC function. IKZF2 depletion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells reduced colony formation, increased differentiation and apoptosis, and delayed leukemogenesis. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and direct IKZF2 binding in MLL-AF9 LSCs demonstrate that IKZF2 regulates a HOXA9 self-renewal gene expression program and inhibits a C/EBP-driven differentiation program. Ectopic HOXA9 expression and CEBPE depletion rescued the effects of IKZF2 depletion.

However, the molecular basis of cAMP production in Arthrobacter species is rarely explored. Here, for the first time, we report the comparative transcriptomic and proteomic study of Arthrobacter cells to elucidate the higher productivity of cAMP under high oxygen supply. We finally obtained 14.1% and 19.3% of the Arthrobacter genome genes which were up-regulated and down-regulated notably, respectively, with high oxygen supply, and identified 54 differently expressed proteins. Our results revealed that high oxygen supply had two major effects on metabolism: inhibition of glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (histidine, branched-chain amino acids and glutamate metabolism); enhancement of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and purine metabolism. We also found that regulation of adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase was not significant under high oxygen supply, suggesting efficient cAMP export might be important in cAMP production. These findings may contribute to further understanding of capacities of Arthrobacter species and would be highly useful in genetic regulation for desirable production.","['Arthrobacter/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesis', 'Oxygen/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proteome/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome']","['Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'GEN', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly']"

26854484,"The standard treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the immunochemotherapy-based R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). Resistance to treatment, intrinsic or acquired, is observed in approximately 40% of patients with DLBCL, who thus require novel interventions to survive. To identify biomarkers for cytotoxic response assessment, microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with doxorubicin sensitivity were determined by combining global miRNA expression profiling with systematic dose-response screens in 15 human DLBCL cell lines. One candidate, miR-34a, was tested in functional in vitro studies and in vivo in a retrospective clinical cohort. High expression of miR-34a was observed in cell lines sensitive to doxorubicin, and upregulation of miR-34a is documented here to increase doxorubicin sensitivity in in vitro lentiviral transduction assays. High expression of miR-34a had a prognostic impact using overall survival as outcome. With risk stratification of DLBCL samples based on resistance gene signatures (REGS), doxorubicin-responsive samples had statistically significant upregulated miR-34a expression. Classification of the DLBCL samples into subset-specific B cell-associated gene signatures (BAGS) revealed differentiation-specific expression of miR-34a. Our data further support FOXP1 as a target of miR-34a, suggesting that downregulation of FOXP1 may sensitize DLBCL cells to doxorubicin. We conclude that miRNAs, in particular miR-34a, may have clinical utility in DLBCL patients as both predictive and prognostic biomarkers.

Using mutants that cause defects in germ cell proliferation or gametogenesis, we identified sets of genes with germline-enriched expression in either hermaphrodites or males, or in both sexes. Additionally, we compared gene expression profiles between males and hermaphrodites lacking germline tissue to define genes with sex-biased expression in terminally differentiated somatic tissues. Cross-referencing hermaphrodite germline and somatic gene sets with in situ hybridization data demonstrates that the vast majority of these genes have appropriate spatial expression patterns. Additionally, we examined gene expression at multiple times during wild-type germline development to define temporal expression profiles for these genes. Sex- and germline-regulated genes have a non-random distribution in the genome, with especially strong biases for and against the X chromosome. Comparison with data from large-scale RNAi screens demonstrates that genes expressed in the oogenic germline display visible phenotypes more frequently than expected.","['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/cytology/*genetics/growth & development', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Disorders of Sex Development/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genome', 'Germ Cells/cytology', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oogenesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Interference', 'Sex Determination Processes', 'Spermatogenesis/genetics', 'X Chromosome/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Database', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Drug development', 'Medicines research and development', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'MAT', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Database name (Osteogenesis)', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'geneseq', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'RNA', 'Structure determination', 'Recombination detection', 'Annotation processing', 'Dermatology', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report']"
29630593,Single-cell RNA-seq of fibroblasts from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patients and wild-type controls,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale droplet-based dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

27288403,"Chromosomes in all organisms are highly organized and divided into multiple chromosomal interaction domains, or topological domains. Regions of active, high transcription help establish and maintain domain boundaries, but precisely how this occurs remains unclear. Here, using fluorescence microscopy and chromosome conformation capture in conjunction with deep sequencing (Hi-C), we show that in Caulobacter crescentus both transcription rate and transcript length, independent of concurrent translation, drive the formation of domain boundaries. We find that long, highly expressed genes do not form topological boundaries simply through the inhibition of supercoil diffusion. Instead, our results support a model in which long, active regions of transcription drive local decompaction of the chromosome, with these more open regions of the chromosome forming spatial gaps in vivo that diminish contacts between DNA in neighboring domains.

To characterize transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in HSCs during development, we leveraged high-throughput genomic approaches to profile miRNAs, lincRNAs, and mRNAs. Our findings indicate that HSCs manifest distinct alternative splicing patterns in key hematopoietic regulators. Detailed analysis of the splicing dynamics and function of one such regulator, HMGA2, identified an alternative isoform that escapes miRNA-mediated targeting. We further identified the splicing kinase CLK3 that, by regulating HMGA2 splicing, preserves HMGA2 function in the setting of an increase in let-7 miRNA levels, delineating how CLK3 and HMGA2 form a functional axis that influences HSC properties during development.

33449399,"Mammalian preimplantation development involves highly conserved genetic programs across species. However, temporal differences in gene network activation and membership differences in gene modules are also observed. In this study, we focus on understanding the activation of crucial gene networks in trophoectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass across species using human, monkey, and mouse models. By single cell RNA sequencing analysis in cynomolgus monkey early embryos, we find relatively late major embryonic genome activation occurring at early morula stages. Gene network preservation analysis reveals that genetic programs in monkey embryos more closely resemble human embryos compared to mouse, supporting the notion that preimplantation development in primate species are divergent from rodent species. For example, primate blastocysts show differential expression of ICM and TE genes such as X and Y, whereas mouse show differences in A and B expression. Interestingly, the overall conservation of TE gene networks is higher than ICM across three species, suggesting a more conserved developmental program in TE lineage differentiation. Additionally, TE-specific gene networks are exclusively activated at the blastocyst stage with low or no expression in morula or earlier embryos. In contrast, a majority of ICM-specific genes are strongly activated during the first major wave of EGA, which are further fine-tuned during late morula and blastocyst stages. Taken together, our study provides new insight into mammalian preimplantation development and sequential activation of lineage-specific genetic programs of TE versus ICM.

Conversely, 20q11.2 gain was only observed in the MLNs of 5 of the 10 sample pairs, indicating that genes in this chromosomal region may play a significant role in OTSCC lymph node metastasis.

This study indicates that additional genetic changes, such as 20q11.2 gain, which encodes the E2F1 gene, can be acquired through clonal evolution, and may be required for the metastatic process. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allelic Imbalance/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/secondary', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'Biomarkers', 'Tumor annotation', 'BIOM format', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'Chromosome annotation (aberration)', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Copy number variation', 'Copy number variation detection', 'DNA variation', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Map', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Heterogen annotation', 'Epistasis', 'MAT', 'Mutation annotation (prognostic)', 'Protein analysis']"
29229819,Genome sequencing of actinomycetes for natural products discovery,"Nature's ability to generate diverse natural products from simple building blocks has inspired combinatorial biosynthesis. The knowledge-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis has allowed the production of designer analogs by rational metabolic pathway engineering. While successful, structural alterations are limited, with designer analogs often produced in compromised titers. The discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis complements the knowledge-based approach by exploring the vast combinatorial biosynthesis repertoire found in Nature. Here we showcase the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis by targeting the domain of unknown function and cysteine lyase domain (DUF-SH) didomain, specific for sulfur incorporation from the leinamycin (LNM) biosynthetic machinery, to discover the LNM family of natural products. By mining bacterial genomes from public databases and the actinomycetes strain collection at The Scripps Research Institute, we discovered 49 potential producers that could be grouped into 18 distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis of the DUF-SH didomains. Further analysis of the representative genomes from each of the clades identified 28 <i>lnm</i>-type gene clusters. Structural diversities encoded by the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries were predicted based on bioinformatics and confirmed by in vitro characterization of selected adenylation proteins and isolation and structural elucidation of the guangnanmycins and weishanmycins. These findings demonstrate the power of the discovery-based approach to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity and highlight Nature's rich biosynthetic repertoire. Comparative analysis of the LNM-type biosynthetic machineries provides outstanding opportunities to dissect Nature's biosynthetic strategies and apply these findings to combinatorial biosynthesis for natural product discovery and structural diversity.","['*Actinobacteria/enzymology/genetics', '*Bacterial Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Genes, Bacterial/*physiology', 'Lactams/*metabolism', 'Macrolides/*metabolism', 'Multigene Family/*physiology', '*Phylogeny', 'Thiazoles/*metabolism', 'Thiones/*metabolism']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Gene ID', 'Molecular docking', 'Gene family report', 'Family name', 'SCOP family', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'Molecules']"
30677397,Expression profiling of extracellular long noncoding RNAs in aqueous humor of primary open-angle glaucoma patients,"This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) diagnosis. First, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression profiles in the aqueous humor (AH) from 10 POAG and 10 control patients were accessed by microarray analyses. Coding-noncoding gene coexpression networks were drawn to predict potential lncRNA functions. lncRNA T267384, ENST00000607393, and T342877 expression levels were further tested by real-time quantitative PCR in AH from 29 POAG and 30 cataract patients, in iris tissues from 16 POAG patients and 10 controls, and in plasma from 49 POAG patients and 55 healthy controls. Finally, ENST00000607393 function was characterized in an in vitro model of cell calcification. A total of 3627 lncRNAs and 2228 mRNAs in the AH of POAG patients were significantly up-regulated, and 1520 lncRNAs and 820 mRNAs were significantly down-regulated. Seven lncRNAs showed positive correlation with glaucoma-associated gene, bone morphogenetic protein 2. Moreover, real-time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that T267384, ENST00000607393, and T342877 expression levels were significantly higher in the AH from a different cohort of POAG patients. ENST00000607393 was also significantly higher in the iris and plasma of POAG patients. Last, ENST00000607393 knockdown alleviated calcification of primary human trabecular meshwork cells in vitro. Therefore, lncRNAs T267384, ENST00000607393, and T342877 may be potential biomarkers for POAG diagnosis.

29488325,Ageing in Macrostomum lignano,"Animals show a large variability of lifespan, ranging from short-lived as Caenorhabditis elegans to immortal as Hydra. A fascinating case is flatworms, in which reversal of aging by regeneration is proposed, yet conclusive evidence for this rejuvenation-by-regeneration hypothesis is lacking. We tested this hypothesis by inducing regeneration in the sexual free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We studied survival, fertility, morphology, and gene expression as a function of age. Here, we report that after regeneration, genes expressed in the germline are upregulated at all ages, but no signs of rejuvenation are observed. Instead, the animal appears to be substantially longer lived than previously appreciated, and genes expressed in stem cells are upregulated with age, while germline genes are downregulated. Remarkably, several genes with known beneficial effects on lifespan when overexpressed in mice and C. elegans are naturally upregulated with age in M. lignano, suggesting that molecular mechanism for offsetting negative consequences of aging has evolved in this animal. We therefore propose that M. lignano represents a novel powerful model for molecular studies of aging attenuation, and the identified aging gene expression patterns provide a valuable resource for further exploration of anti-aging strategies.","['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Platyhelminths']","['Imaging', 'Medical imaging', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mathematics']"
30404917,Drosophila intestinal stem and progenitor cells are major sources and regulators of homeostatic niche signals,"Epithelial homeostasis requires the precise balance of epithelial stem/progenitor proliferation and differentiation. While many signaling pathways that regulate epithelial stem cells have been identified, it is probable that other regulators remain unidentified. Here, we use gene-expression profiling by targeted DamID to identify the stem/progenitor-specific transcription and signaling factors in the <i>Drosophila</i> midgut. Many signaling pathway components, including ligands of most major pathways, exhibit stem/progenitor-specific expression and have regulatory regions bound by both intrinsic and extrinsic transcription factors. In addition to previously identified stem/progenitor-derived ligands, we show that both the insulin-like factor Ilp6 and TNF ligand eiger are specifically expressed in the stem/progenitors and regulate normal tissue homeostasis. We propose that intestinal stem cells not only integrate multiple signals but also contribute to and regulate the homeostatic signaling microenvironmental niche through the expression of autocrine and paracrine factors.","['Animals', 'Drosophila/cytology/*physiology', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Intestines/*cytology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Epistasis', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'cel', 'CellML']"

Latexin (Lxn) is a negative stem cell regulatory gene identified on the basis of genetic diversity. By using an Lxn knockout mouse model, we found that Lxn inactivation in vivo led to the physiological expansion of the entire hematopoietic hierarchy. Loss of Lxn enhanced the competitive repopulation capacity and survival of HSCs in a cell-intrinsic manner. Gene profiling of Lxn-null HSCs showed altered expression of genes enriched in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Thrombospondin 1 (Thbs1) was a potential downstream target with a dramatic downregulation in Lxn-null HSCs. Enforced expression of Thbs1 restored the Lxn inactivation-mediated HSC phenotypes. This study reveals that Lxn plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostatic hematopoiesis, and it may lead to development of safe and effective approaches to manipulate HSCs for clinical benefit.","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Cell type accession', 'Deletion detection', 'Deletion map', 'Gene ID', 'Transposon prediction', 'Regenerative medicine', 'DNA translation', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Biobank']"
18267014,"BackgroundArray-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) is commonly used to determine the genomic content of bacterial strains. In aCGH data, systematic errors are comparable to those occurring in transcriptome data. However, especially for microbes, an additional source of variation exists: differences in hybridization due to gene sequence divergence between the strains hybridized. Current normalization methods do not take this source of variation into consideration.ResultsWe present Supervised Lowess, or S-Lowess, an application of the subset Lowess normalization method that does take difference in genomic content into account. The performance of S-Lowess was assessed on aCGH experiments in which differentially labeled genomic DNA fragments of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 and L. lactis MG1363 strains were hybridized to IL1403 microarrays. Since both genome sequences are known (they have only on average 85 % sequence identity), the success rate in detecting deletions in the MG1363 genome of different aCGH normalization methods can be compared. S-Lowess detects 97% of the deletions, whereas other aCGH normalization methods detect up to only 60% of the deletions.ConclusionsS-Lowess removes systematic errors from dual-dye aCGH data in two steps: (i) determination of likely homologous genes (LHG); and (ii) estimation of correction factors for systematic errors from spots of LHG and subset Lowess normalization of the remaining spots using these correction factors. It is implemented in a user-friendly web-tool accessible from http://bioinformatics.biol.rug.nl/websoftware/s-lowess. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing normalization methods and maximizes the number of detectable genomic deletions or duplications from microbial aCGH data. Keywords: comparative genome hybridisation
In this study, 4 aCGH comparisons (slides) between L. lactis MG1363 and L. lactis IL1403 were performed (including dye swap with biological replicates; see also supplementary materials). The resulting aCGH slide signals were normalized using the different 'likely homologous gene' (LHG) sets (see above) yielding ratios of signals of labelled DNA of MG1363 over those of IL1403. A maximum of 8 ratios per amplicon (gene) were obtained for the 4 hybridized slides (each with 2 replicate spots per amplicon). Only genes with at least 5 measurements were used in this study. The normalization methods evaluated in this study are: a) no normalization, b) total signal normalization, c) grid-based Lowess (implemented in PreP; f = 0.7) [García de la Nava, J et al. 2003. Bioinformatics 19:2328-2329], and d) S-Lowess using different subsets of conserved lactococcal genes (for details see above).

27746144,"Mutations in growth factor receptor signaling pathways are common in cancer, including in tumors that arise from or metastasize to the brain. However, most small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain cancers, potentially due to inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting non-oncogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that EGFR-mutant cancers, including a highly lethal form of brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM), are remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering them sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist selectively kills GBM cells in an LXRβ- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing massive tumor regression and prolonged survival in mouse models.

Clinical studies have shown that grafted fetal neural tissue can achieve considerable biochemical and clinical improvements in PD. However, the source of fetal tissue grafts is limited and ethically controversial. Human parthenogenetic stem cells offer a good alternative because they are derived from unfertilized oocytes without destroying potentially viable human embryos and can be used to generate an unlimited supply of neural cells for transplantation. We have previously reported that human parthenogenetic stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hpNSCs) successfully engraft, survive long term, and increase brain dopamine (DA) levels in rodent and nonhuman primate models of PD. Here we report the results of a 12-month transplantation study of hpNSCs in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned African green monkeys with moderate to severe clinical parkinsonian symptoms.

Using gene expression profiling assay for the cells treated with tetracycline (Tet+) or without tetracycline (Tet-), we identified CASZ1b target genes and downstream transcriptional pathways in neuroblastoma cells.
SY5YtetCASZ1b cells were cultured in 6-well plate overnight, then treated with or without 1 µg/ml tetracyline for 24 hr. Three independent experiments were performed for microarray analysis","As a transcription factor, localization to the nucleus and the recruitment of cofactors to regulate gene transcription is essential. Nuclear localization and nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex binding are required for the zinc-finger transcription factor CASZ1 to function as a neuroblastoma (NB) tumor suppressor. However, the critical amino acids (AAs) that are required for CASZ1 interaction with NuRD complex and the regulation of CASZ1 subcellular localization have not been characterized. Through alanine scanning, immunofluorescence cell staining and co-immunoprecipitation, we define a critical region at the CASZ1 N terminus (AAs 23-40) that mediates the CASZ1b nuclear localization and NuRD interaction. Furthermore, we identified a nuclear export signal (NES) at the N terminus (AAs 176-192) that contributes to CASZ1 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling in a chromosomal maintenance 1-dependent manner. An analysis of CASZ1 protein expression in a primary NB tissue microarray shows that high nuclear CASZ1 staining is detected in tumor samples from NB patients with good prognosis. In contrast, cytoplasmic-restricted CASZ1 staining or low nuclear CASZ1 staining is found in tumor samples from patients with poor prognosis. These findings provide insight into mechanisms by which CASZ1 regulates transcription, and suggests that regulation of CASZ1 subcellular localization may impact its function in normal development and pathologic conditions such as NB tumorigenesis.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Export Signals', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']","['Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'ACE', 'Sequence trace', 'Sequence trace format', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Neurobiology', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'Expression signals', 'Nucleic acid signature', 'Nucleic acid report', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein report', 'protein', 'Protein report format', 'Recombination detection', 'Proteins', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

To define its role during the hematopoietic lineage commitment, we silenced c-myb in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Noteworthy, c-myb silencing increased the commitment capacity toward the macrophage and megakaryocyte lineages, whereas erythroid differentiation was impaired, as demonstrated by clonogenic assay, morphologic and immunophenotypic data. Gene expression profiling and computational analysis of promoter regions of genes modulated in c-myb-silenced CD34(+) cells identified the transcription factors Kruppel-Like Factor 1 (KLF1) and LIM Domain Only 2 (LMO2) as putative targets, which can account for c-myb knockdown effects. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that c-myb binds to KLF1 and LMO2 promoters and transactivates their expression. Consistently, the retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of either KLF1 or LMO2 partially rescued the defect in erythropoiesis caused by c-myb silencing, whereas only KLF1 was also able to repress the megakaryocyte differentiation enhanced in Myb-silenced CD34(+) cells.

19008212,Acetaminophen-induced gene expression profiles in sandwich-cultured primary rat hepatoctyes,"The frequent use of rodent hepatic in vitro systems in pharmacological and toxicological investigations challenges extrapolation of in vitro results to the situation in vivo and interspecies extrapolation from rodents to humans. The toxicogenomics approach may aid in evaluating relevance of these model systems for human risk assessment by direct comparison of toxicant-induced gene expression profiles and infers mechanisms between several systems. In the present study, acetaminophen (APAP) was used as a model compound to compare gene expression responses between rat and human using in vitro cellular models, hepatocytes, and between rat in vitro and in vivo. Comparison at the level of modulated biochemical pathways and biological processes rather than at that of individual genes appears preferable as it increases the overlap between various systems. Pathway analysis by T-profiler revealed similar biochemical pathways and biological processes repressed in rat and human hepatocytes in vitro, as well as in rat liver in vitro and in vivo. Repressed pathways comprised energy-consuming biochemical pathways, mitochondrial function, and oxidoreductase activity. The present study is the first that used a toxicogenomics-based parallelogram approach, extrapolating in vitro to in vivo and interspecies, to reveal relevant mechanisms indicative of APAP-induced liver toxicity in humans in vivo.","['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Species Specificity', 'Toxicogenetics/*methods']","['ACE', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'MGED', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'MGED concept ID', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Compound name', 'Cheminformatics', 'Chemical identifier', 'Hepatic and biliary medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Microarray hybridisation data', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'MAT', 'Active site prediction', 'Gene prediction', 'Promoter prediction', 'rna', 'RNA', 'RNA sequence', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'TAR format', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Genetics', 'Phylogenetics', 'Toxicology']"
28258184,"The germ cells of multicellular organisms protect their developmental potential through specialized mechanisms.  A shared feature of germ cells from worms to humans is the presence of non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein organelles called germ granules.  Depletion of germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans (i.e., P granules) leads to sterility and in some germlines expression of the neuronal transgene unc-119::gfp and the muscle myosin MYO-3.  Thus, P granules are hypothesized to maintain germ cell totipotency by preventing somatic development, although the mechanism by which P granules carry out this function is unknown.  In this study, we performed transcriptome and single molecule RNA-FISH analyses of dissected P-granule-depleted gonads at different developmental stages.  Our results demonstrate that P granules are necessary for adult germ cells to down-regulate spermatogenesis RNAs and to prevent the accumulation of numerous soma-specific RNAs.  P-granule-depleted gonads that express the unc-119::gfp transgene also express many other genes involved in neuronal development and concomitantly lose expression of germ cell fate markers.  Finally, we show that removal of either of two critical P-granule components, PGL-1 or GLH-1, is sufficient to cause germ cells to express UNC-119::GFP and MYO-3 and to display RNA accumulation defects similar to those observed after depletion of P granules.  Our data identify P granules as critical modulators of the germline transcriptome and guardians of germ cell fate.

28272987,"Phf5a regulates transcription elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), through regulation of the Paf1 complex. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of H2BK120-ub in mouse ESCs under conditions of shControl and shPhf5a knockdown. These results revealed that downregualtion of Phf5a results in the increase of the elongation mark H2BK120-ub from the gene bodies of pluripotency genes in ESC.
Ten million cells were treated with micrococcal nuclease to generate mono-nucleosomes and chromatin was precipitated using 10 micrograms of antibody against H2Bk120-ub, clone 56 (Millipore, 05-1312).","Maintenance of stem cell plasticity is determined by the ability to balance opposing forces that control gene expression. Regulation of transcriptional networks, signaling cues and chromatin-modifying mechanisms constitute crucial determinants of tissue equilibrium. Histone modifications can affect chromatin compaction, therefore co-transcriptional events that influence their deposition determine the propensities toward quiescence, self-renewal, or cell specification. The Paf1 complex (Paf1C) is a critical regulator of RNA PolII elongation that controls gene expression and deposition of histone modifications, however few studies have focused on its role affecting stem cell fate decisions. Here we delineate the functions of Paf1C in pluripotency and characterize its impact in deposition of H2B ubiquitylation (H2BK120-ub) and H3K79 methylation (H3K79me), 2 fundamental histone marks that shape transcriptional regulation. We identify that H2BK120-ub is increased in the absence of Paf1C on its embryonic stem cell targets, in sharp contrast to H3K79me, suggesting opposite functions in the maintenance of self-renewal. Furthermore, we found that core pluripotency genes are characterized by a dual gain of H2BK120-ub and loss of H3K79me on their gene bodies. Our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms of cellular adaptation and reveal novel functions of Paf1C in the regulation of the self-renewal network.","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Trans-Activators', 'Ubiquitination']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein identifier', 'Cell line report', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Histogram', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Mouse clinic', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Embryology', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Citation', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Recombination detection', 'Ordination plot']"

Refer to individual Series","The mechanism by which MORPHEUS' MOLECULE1 (MOM1) contributes to transcriptional gene silencing has remained elusive since the gene was first identified and characterized. Here, we report that two Arabidopsis thaliana PIAS (PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT)-type SUMO E3 ligase-like proteins, PIAL1 and PIAL2, function redundantly to mediate transcriptional silencing at MOM1 target loci. PIAL1 and PIAL2 physically interact with each other and with MOM1 to form a high molecular mass complex. In the absence of either PIAL2 or MOM1, the formation of the high molecular mass complex is disrupted. We identified a previously uncharacterized IND (interacting domain) in PIAL1 and PIAL2 and demonstrated that IND directly interacts with MOM1. The CMM2 (conserved MOM1 motif 2) domain of MOM1 was previously shown to be required for the dimerization of MOM1. We demonstrated that the CMM2 domain is also required for the interaction of MOM1 with PIAL1 and PIAL2. We found that although PIAL2 has SUMO E3 ligase activity, the activity is dispensable for PIAL2's function in transcriptional silencing. This study suggests that PIAL1 and PIAl2 act as components of the MOM1-containing complex to mediate transcriptional silencing at heterochromatin regions.","['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Arabidopsis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Silencing', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
18212247,"The CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) transcription factor plays a key role in the regulation of growth and differentiation of the granulocytic lineage in the hematopoietic system and CEBPA (encoding C/EBPalpha) is often mutated or deregulated in AML patients. Consistently, mice lacking C/EBPalpha have no mature neutrophils and die within a few hours. However, homozygous knockin mice in which wild type Cebpa has been replaced with a mutant allele (BRM2), which abolish the growth-repressing ability of C/EBPalpha, are viable, but at 8 weeks of age they display myeloid dysplasia with absence of neutrophil granulocytes. Strikingly, in older CebpaBRM2/BRM2 knockin mice the myeloid dysplastic phenotype progress into other myeloid malignancies such as myeloid proliferative syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia-like malignancy. This strongly suggests that secondary mutations in other loci must occur when developing leukemia in the CebpaBRM2/BRM2.In order to identify genes that cooperate with Cebpa mutations in the development of leukemia in CebpaBRM2/BRM2 mice a so-called retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen was performed. Inbred newborn CebpaBRM2/BRM2 and wildtype mice were injected with SRS19-6 retrovirus, which incorporated into the genome and resulted in activation of oncogenes and leukemic progression. When leukemia was evident the mice were euthanized and analyzed. As expected the CebpaBRM2/BRM2 mice had a shorter latency than wildtype mice (186 vs. 276 days). The mice had enlarged spleen, thymus, and/or lymph nodes and were thoroughly investigated by histology, flow cytometry and southern in order to determine the leukemic phenotypes. Most of the CebpaBRM2/BRM2 mice developed an AML-like phenotype, whereas T cell leukemias were most prominent in wildtype mice, showing that mutating Cebpa specifically directs leukemic progression towards a myeloid direction. Genomic instability was analyzed by CGH. Finally, the retroviral insertion loci were identified through a splinkerette-aided PCR strategy. This led to the identification of several novel putative and previously unexplored oncogenes, which might collaborate with mutated Cebpa in the development of AML.Keywords: Disease state analysis

Here, we use SRS19-6-driven retroviral insertional mutagenesis to compare the phenotypes of leukemias arising in Cebpa(+/+), Cebpa(+/BRM2), and Cebpa(BRM2/BRM2) mice, with respect to disease type, latency of tumor development, and identity of the retroviral insertion sites (RISs). Both Cebpa(+/BRM2) and Cebpa(BRM2/BRM2) mice preferentially develop myeloid leukemias, but with differing latencies, thereby demonstrating the importance of gene dosage. Determination of RISs led to the identification of several novel candidate oncogenes, some of which may collaborate specifically with the E2F repression-deficient allele of Cebpa. Finally, we used an in silico pathway analysis approach to extract additional information from single RISs, leading to the identification of signaling pathways which were preferentially deregulated in a disease- and/or genotype-specific manner.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Injections', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Virus Latency']","['Allele frequency distribution analysis', 'Organelles', 'Small molecules', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Binding site prediction', 'Clone ID', 'Clone library', 'Clone ID (IMAGE)', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Data management', 'Pain medicine', 'Sequence alignment refinement', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Plasmid map', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'Genomics', 'Annotation track', 'Nucleic acid features (immunoglobulin gene structure)', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunogen design', 'Protein interactions', 'Selection detection', 'Feature extraction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'PDB insertion code', 'Mutation ID', 'Function analysis', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Cultivation parameter', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation']"

We hypothesize that early gene expression-mediated molecular changes could be used to delineate adaptive and adverse responses to environmentally-based perturbations. Here, we examined cellular responses of the tracheobronchial airway to zinc (Zn) exposure, a model oxidant. Airway derived BEAS-2B cells exposed to 2–10 µM Zn2+ elicited concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity. Normal, adaptive, and cytotoxic Zn2+ exposure conditions were determined with traditional apical endpoints, and differences in global gene expression around the tipping point of the responses were used to delineate underlying molecular mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses of differentially expressed genes indicate early enrichment of stress signaling pathways, including those mediated by the transcription factors p53 and NRF2. After 4 h, 154 genes were differentially expressed (p <0.01) between the adaptive and cytotoxic Zn2+ concentrations. Nearly 40% of the biomarker genes were related to the p53 signaling pathway with 30 genes identified as likely direct targets using a database of p53 ChIP-seq studies. Despite similar p53 activation profiles, these data revealed widespread dampening of p53 and NRF2-related genes as early as 4 h after exposure at higher, unrecoverable Zn2+ exposures. Thus, in our model early increased activation of stress response pathways indicated a recoverable adaptive event. Overall, this study highlights the importance of characterizing molecular mechanisms around the tipping point of adverse responses to better inform HTS paradigms.

30287954,"Primary cell wall is an essential cell structure for plant playing major roles in plant growth, differentiation, and stress responses. Here we demonstrate that a group of AP2-ERF transcription factor regulates primary cell wall formation and can induce massive accumulation of it in empty fiber cell of the nst1-1 nst3-1 mutant lacking secondary cell wall in Arabidopsis. The transgenic plants expressing one of the AP2-ERF transcription factors fused with VP16 transcriptional activation domain under the control of NST3 promoter in the nst1-1 nst3-1 mutant showed similar level of cell wall contents with wild type by the massive accumulation of cell wall which lacks lignin and xylan. The transgenic plants showed 70% higher saccharification efficiency than wild type. Gene expression analysis using microarray revealed that genes related to primary cell wall were highly upregulated in the transgenic plant. Moreover, chimeric-activator of the AP2-ERF transcription factor accelerated cell wall regeneration of mesophyll protoplast of Arabidopsis while the chimeric-repressor retarded it. These data suggest that the group of AP2-ERF transcription factor is key regulator of the primary cell wall formation in plant and could be employed to produce massive cell wall with readily extractable feature.

By contrast, primary cell walls, which are chemically distinct, flexible and generally unlignified<sup>2</sup>, are easier to deconstruct. Thus, engineering certain primary wall characteristics into xylem secondary walls would be interesting to readily exploit biomass for industrial processing. Here, we demonstrated that by expressing AP2/ERF transcription factors from group IIId and IIIe in xylem fibre cells of mutants lacking secondary walls, we could generate plants with thickened cell wall characteristics of primary cell walls in the place of secondary cell walls. These unique, newly formed walls displayed physicochemical and ultrastructural features consistent with primary walls and had gene expression profiles illustrative of primary wall synthesis.

27923070,"Background: In malaria, parasites of the genus Plasmodium elicit robust host expansion of macrophages and monocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In a microarray analysis of pooled, activated CD4+ T cells from mice infected with P. chabaudi, we detected inducible expression of Csf1, which promotes macrophage proliferation. To better characterize Csf1-producing T cells, single-cell RNA-Seq was performed.Results: Robust Csf1 expression was detected in a subset of sampled CD4+ T cells (n = 14/35), whereas the remainder of cells had no detectable Csf1. Further, we identified ~ 400 genes that were differentially expressed between Csf1+ and Csf1- T cells.Conclusions: This work defines the transcriptional landscape of a subset of activated CD4+ T cells that produce the cytokine Csf1. These cells are expected to be important in infections with intracellular pathogens such as Plasmodium.
Antigen-experienced (CD11a+ CD49d+) CD4+ T cells were isolated by double-sorting from the blood of C57BL/6 adult female mice 6 days post-infection with Plasmodium chabaudi.   Single cells were isolated and processed for RNA sequencing using a Fluidigm C1 integrated fluidic circuit chip.  35 biological replicates were analyzed.","Dynamic regulation of leukocyte population size and activation state is crucial for an effective immune response. In malaria, Plasmodium parasites elicit robust host expansion of macrophages and monocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that myeloid expansion during P. chabaudi infection is dependent upon both CD4+ T cells and the cytokine Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF). Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis on antigen-experienced T cells revealed robust expression of Csf1, the gene encoding MCSF, in a sub-population of CD4+ T cells with distinct transcriptional and surface phenotypes. Selective deletion of Csf1 in CD4+ cells during P. chabaudi infection diminished proliferation and activation of certain myeloid subsets, most notably lymph node-resident CD169+ macrophages, and resulted in increased parasite burden and impaired recovery of infected mice. Depletion of CD169+ macrophages during infection also led to increased parasitemia and significant host mortality, confirming a previously unappreciated role for these cells in control of P. chabaudi. This work establishes the CD4+ T cell as a physiologically relevant source of MCSF in vivo; probes the complexity of the CD4+ T cell response during type 1 infection; and delineates a novel mechanism by which T helper cells regulate myeloid cells to limit growth of a blood-borne intracellular pathogen.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Malaria/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasmodium chabaudi/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence coordinates', 'Protein active sites', 'Sequence position', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Cytometry', 'Protein geometry data', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Laboratory techniques', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Plasmodium falciparum)', 'Gene ID (PlasmoDB)', 'Plasmid map', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data']"
27259716,"The cell and tissue of origin of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is controversial.  While the disease was traditionally assumed to arise from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), recent work supports an alternative model implicating the fallopian tube fimbriae epithelium (FTE).  We used comparative DNA methylome analyses as a means to test these two competing models, hypothesizing that the HGSC methylome should more closely resemble its tissue of origin.  Using two separate analysis methods, analysis within distinct genomic contexts, and validation studies using large-scale publically available HGSC methylome data, we consistently observed that the DNA methylome of HGSC more closely resembles FTE than OSE.   These data support the FTE origin model, and suggest DNA methylome analysis as a useful approach to examine cell/tissue lineage origin in cancer.HGSC is the most common and lethal form of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).  Two distinct tissues have been hypothesized as the tissue of origin of HGSC: OSE and FTE.  We hypothesized that the DNA methylome of HGSC would more closely resemble the methylome of its tissue of origin. To test this, we profiled HGSC (n=10), OSE (n=7), and FTE (n=7) primary fresh-frozen tissues, and analyzed DNA methylome using Illumina 450K arrays (n=24) and Agilent Sure Select methyl-seq (n=7).  We compared methylomes using statistical analyses of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMC) and differentially methylated regions (DMR), and methylation within a variety of different genomic contexts, including CpG island shores.  We also analyzed methylation specifically at Homeobox (HOX) genes, due to their role in tissue specification.  We used publically available HGSC methylome data (n=628) to provide additional comparison with FTE and OSE and potential validation.  This analysis revealed that HGSC and FTE methylomes were significantly and consistently more highly conserved than were HGSC and OSE.   Pearson correlations and hierarchal clustering of genes, promoters, CpG islands, CpG island shores, and HOX genes all revealed the increased relatedness of HGSC and FTE methylomes.  In addition, two different large data sets of publically-available HGSC methylome data confirmed these relationships.   In summary, our findings support the FTE origin model for HGSC, the most common and deadly EOC subtype.  Due to its tissue-specificity and biochemical stability, interrogation of the DNA methylome appears to be a valuable approach to examine cell/tissue lineage in cancer.

Two distinct tissues have been suggested as the tissue of origin: ovarian surface epithelia (OSE) and fallopian tube epithelia (FTE). We hypothesized that the DNA methylome of HGSC should more closely resemble the methylome of its tissue of origin. To this end, we profiled HGSC (n = 10), and patient-matched OSE and FTE (n = 5) primary fresh-frozen tissues, and analyzed the DNA methylome using Illumina 450K arrays (n = 20) and Agilent Sure Select methyl-seq (n = 7). Methylomes were compared using statistical analyses of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMC) and differentially methylated regions (DMR). In addition, methylation was evaluated within a variety of different genomic contexts, including CpG island shores and Homeobox (HOX) genes, due to their roles in tissue specification. Publicly available HGSC methylome data (n = 628) were interrogated to provide additional comparisons with FTE and OSE for validation. These analyses revealed that HGSC and FTE methylomes are significantly and consistently more highly conserved than are HGSC and OSE. Pearson correlations and hierarchal clustering of genes, promoters, CpG islands, CpG island shores, and HOX genes all revealed increased relatedness of HGSC and FTE methylomes. Thus, these findings reveal that the landscape of FTE more closely resembles HGSC, the most common and deadly EOC subtype.","['Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Fallopian Tubes/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics']","['Staden format', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Parsing', 'Variant classification', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling']"
17660570,"The contribution of epigenetic alterations to natural variation for gene transcription levels remains unclear.  In this study, we investigated the functional targets of the maize chromomethylase ZMET2 in multiple inbred lines to determine whether epigenetic changes conditioned by this chromomethylase are conserved or variable within the species.  Gene expression microarrays were hybridized with RNA samples from the inbred lines B73 and Mo17, and from near-isogenic derivatives containing the loss-of-function allele zmet2-m1.  A set of 126 genes that displayed statistically significant differential expression in zmet2 mutants relative to wild-type plants in at least one of the two genetic backgrounds were identified.  Analysis of the transcript levels in both wild-type and mutant individuals revealed that only 10% of these genes were affected in zmet2 mutants in both B73 and Mo17 genetic backgrounds.  Over 80% of the genes with expression patterns affected by zmet2 mutations display variation for gene expression between wild-type B73 and Mo17 plants.  Further analysis was performed for seven genes that were transcriptionally silent in wild-type B73, but expressed in B73 zmet2-m1, wild-type Mo17 and Mo17 zmet2-m1 lines.  Mapping experiments confirmed that the expression differences in wild-type B73 relative to Mo17 inbreds for these genes were caused by cis-acting regulatory variation.  Methylation-sensitive PCR and bisulphite sequencing demonstrated that for five of these genes the CpNpG methylation in the wild-type B73 genetic background was substantially decreased in the B73 zmet2-m1 mutant and in wild-type Mo17.  A survey of eight maize inbreds reveals that each of these five genes exhibit transcriptionally silent and methylated states in some inbred lines and unmethylated, expressed states in other inbreds, providing evidence for natural variation in epigenetic states for some maize genes.

27611783,"We aimed to elucidate the effects of feeding condition (indoor grain-feeding vs. grazing on pasture) on c-miRNAs in Japanese Black (JB) cattle (Wagyu). The cattle at 18 months old were divided into pasture feeding and conventional indoor grain feeding for 5 months. Microarray analysis of c-miRNAs from the plasma extracellular vesicles led to the detection of a total of 202 bovine miRNAs in the plasma, including 15 miRNAs that differed between the feeding conditions.
miRNA expression in plasma extracellular vesicles (Evs) of the cattle was measured after 5 months of grazing or grain feeding. Plasma EV samples prepared from three cattle for each treatment were collected for microarray analysis .","We aimed to understand the roles of miRNAs in the muscle tissue maturation and those of circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) in beef production of Japanese Black (JB) cattle (Wagyu), a breed with genetically background of superior intermuscular fat depot, by comparing different feeding conditions (indoor grain-feeding vs. grazing on pasture). The cattle at 18 months old were assigned to pasture feeding or conventional indoor grain feeding conditions for 5 months. Microarray analysis of c-miRNAs from the plasma extracellular vesicles led to the detection of a total of 202 bovine miRNAs in the plasma, including 15 miRNAs that differed between the feeding conditions. Validation of the microarray results by qPCR showed that the circulating miR-10b level in the grazing cattle was upregulated compared to that of the grain-fed cattle. In contrast, the levels of miR-17-5p, miR-19b, miR-29b, miR-30b-5p, miR-98, miR-142-5p, miR-301a, miR-374b, miR-425-5p, and miR-652 were lower in the grazing cattle than in the grain-fed cattle. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the predicted target genes of those c-miRNAs were enriched in gene ontology terms associated with blood vessel morphogenesis, plasma membrane, focal adhesion, endocytosis, collagen, ECM-receptor interaction, and phosphorylation. In the grazing cattle, the elevation of miR-10b expression in the plasma was coincident with its elevation in the longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle. Expression of bovine-specific miR-2478, the most plasma-enriched miRNA, tended to be also upregulated in the muscle but not in the plasma. Furthermore, grazing caused the downregulated mRNA expression of predicted miR-10b and/or miR-2478 target genes, such as DNAJB2, PTEN, and SCD1. Thus, the feeding system used for JB cattle affected the c-miRNAs that could be indicators of grain feeding. Among these, miR-10b expression was especially associated with feeding-induced changes and with the expression of the potential target genes responsible for glucose homeostasis and intramuscular fat depot in the LL muscle of JB cattle.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Herbivory', 'Lipogenesis/genetics/physiology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'Lipoproteins', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Phosphorylation sites']"
29212533,"Understanding chromatin dynamics is a key to other related processes, including DNA replication, transcription and recombination. As a first step, recently, an increasing amount of effort has been devoted to precisely define nucleosome positioning in different organisms. The most popular method to do so is digestion by Micrococcal nuclease (MNase), nowadays followed by ultrasequencing of the generated fragments. Although the sequence bias of MNase has been known for a long time, a data-based way of correcting this bias for sequencing experiments is still missing. Here we provide such a method, based on the digestion of naked DNA and the use of the bioinformatic tool DANPOS. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we demonstrate that the overall quality of the data is better after the correction proposed here. The characteristics of the method make it perfectly applicable to any other organism. Moreover, we find that the correction affects more to TATA containing genes than to TATA-like genes. Importantly, the correction uncovers a new role for TFIIS in chromatin dynamics. The absence of TFIIS caused a general increase in nucleosome fuzziness, and a higher peak of the -1 nucleosome at some promoters
Mnase-Seq experiments in both strains WT and dst1∆ mutant","TFIIS stimulates RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II and promotes the resolution of backtracking events. TFIIS acts in the chromatin context, but its contribution to the chromatin landscape has not yet been investigated. Co-transcriptional chromatin alterations include subtle changes in nucleosome positioning, like those expected to be elicited by TFIIS, which are elusive to detect. The most popular method to map nucleosomes involves intensive chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Maps based on these exhaustively digested samples miss any MNase-sensitive nucleosomes caused by transcription. In contrast, partial digestion approaches preserve such nucleosomes, but introduce noise due to MNase sequence preferences. A systematic way of correcting this bias for massively parallel sequencing experiments is still missing.","['High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/*metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']","['High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Nucleosome exclusion sequences', 'Nucleosome position prediction', 'Nucleosome formation potential prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'Reaction ID', 'Reaction data', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Relation extraction', 'Residue contact prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription']"
24885291,"These arrays were done in the context of a study to probe gene expression variation across Y-chromosome substitution lines of Drosophila melanogasterKeywords: polymorphism, evolution, chromosome substitution
This series contains all the arrays and designs described in Lemos et al.","Mito-nuclear gene interactions regulate energy conversion, and are fundamental to eukaryotes. Generally, mito-nuclear coadaptation would be most efficient if the interacting nuclear genes were X-linked, because this maximizes the probability of favorable mito-nuclear allelic combinations co-transmitting across generations. Thus, under a coadaptation (CA) hypothesis, nuclear genes essential for mitochondrial function might be under selection to relocate to the X-chromosome. However, maternal inheritance predisposes the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accumulate variation that, while male-harming, is benign to females. Numerous nuclear genes were recently reported in Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibit male-specific patterns of differential expression when placed alongside different mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting that nuclear genes are sensitive to an underlying male-specific mitochondrial mutation load. These genes are thus candidates for involvement in mito-nuclear interactions driven by sexual conflict (SC), and selection might have moved them off the X-chromosome to facilitate an optimal evolutionary counter-response, through males, to the presence of male-harming mtDNA mutations. Furthermore, the presence of male-harming mtDNA mutations could exert selection for modifiers on the Y-chromosome, thus placing these mito-sensitive nuclear genes at the center of an evolutionary tug-of-war between mitochondrion and Y-chromosome.We test these hypotheses by examining the chromosomal distributions of three distinct sets of mitochondrial-interacting nuclear genes in D. melanogaster; the first is a list of genes with mitochondrial annotations by Gene Ontologies, the second is a list comprising the core evolutionary-conserved mitochondrial proteome, and the third is a list of genes involved in male-specific responses to maternally-inherited mitochondrial variation and which might be putative targets of Y-chromosomal regulation.","['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mitosis/*genetics', '*X Chromosome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'MAT', 'Mitochondria', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report']"
22580345,Combined miRNA and mRNA Sequencing Identifies Protective Transcriptional Signature of Enhanced PI3Kalpha Signaling in Cardiac Hypertrophy,"The perturbation of myocardial transcriptome homeostasis is the hallmark of pathological hypertrophy, underlying the maladaptive myocardial remodeling secondary to pathological stresses. Classic and novel therapeutics that provide beneficial effects against pathological remodeling likely impact myocardial transcriptome architecture, including miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Microarray and PCR-based technologies, although employed extensively, cannot provide adequate sequence coverage or quantitative accuracy to test this hypothesis directly. The goal of this study was to develop and exploit next-generation sequencing approaches for comprehensive and quantitative analyses of myocardial miRNAs and mRNAs to test the hypothesis that augmented phosphoinositide-3-kinase-p110α (PI3Kα) signaling in the setting of pathological hypertrophy provides beneficial effects through remodeling of the myocardial transcriptome signature. In these studies, a molecular and bioinformatic pipeline permitting comprehensive analysis and quantification of myocardial miRNA and mRNA expression with next-generation sequencing was developed and the impact of enhanced PI3Kα signaling on the myocardial transcriptome signature of pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy was explored. These analyses identified multiple miRNAs and mRNAs that were abnormally expressed in pathological hypertrophy and partially or completely normalized with increased PI3Kα signaling. Additionally, several novel miRNAs potentially linked to remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy were identified. Additional experiments revealed that increased PI3Kα signaling reduces cardiac fibrosis in pathological hypertrophy through modulating TGF-β signaling and miR-21 expression. In conclusion, using the approach of combined miRNA and mRNA sequencing, we identify the protective transcriptome signature of enhanced PI3Kα signaling in the context of pathological hypertrophy, and demonstrate the regulation of TGF-β/miR-21 by which enhanced PI3Kα signaling protects against cardiac fibrosis.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cardiomegaly/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Endomyocardial Fibrosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heart Ventricles/metabolism', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome', 'Ventricular Remodeling/genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Cardiology', 'Cardinality', 'mega', 'Kinase name', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'WormBase class', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Article report', 'Article', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleotide', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Annotation track', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid data', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Protein modelling']"

We selected the thrombomodulin gene locus with its complex pattern of five VDR binding sites and multiple histone acetylation and open chromatin regions as an example to investigate together with a number of reference genes, the primary transcriptional responses to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA. Transcriptome-wide, 18.4% of all expressed genes are either up-or down-regulated already after a 90 min TsA treatment; their response pattern to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TsA sorts them into at least six classes. TsA stimulates a far higher number of genes than 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and dominates the outcome of combined treatments. However, 200 TsA target genes can be modulated by 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) and more than 1000 genes respond only when treated with both compounds. The genomic view on the genes suggests that the degree of acetylation at transcription start sites and VDR binding regions may determine the effect of TsA on mRNA expression and its interference with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3).

To investigate the mechanisms which underlie this, we have studied the regulation of the model genes Mdc and Il12b, whose stimulus-induced expression is tightly restricted to specific cells of the immune system. Surprisingly, we find that neither the promoter nor the enhancer sequences of these genes are sufficient to direct this cell-type specificity. Instead, the activities of upstream enhancers are repressed in nonexpressing cells by high levels of trimethylated H3K9 in their flanking regions. Genome-wide analysis indicates that this manner of regulation is shared by numerous enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. In dendritic cells and macrophages, the stimulus-induced demethylase Jmjd2d controls H3K9me3 levels at these regions, and is thereby required for Mdc and Il12b transcription. By experimentally assaying multiple enhancers in a variety of cell types, we show that regulation by H3K9me3 is a widely used mechanism which imparts specificity to the activities of otherwise broadly functional enhancers.","['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL22/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-12 Subunit p40/genetics', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']","['cel', 'CellML', 'Cell type accession', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Chemometrics', 'Compound ID (ChEMBL)', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Histogram', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'CATH domain ID', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Promoter ID', 'Promoter prediction', 'Promoters']"

Here, through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated forward genetic screen, we identified MORC2 as an essential gene required for epigenetic silencing by the HUSH complex. HUSH recruits MORC2 to target sites in heterochromatin. We exploited a new method, differential viral accessibility (DIVA), to show that loss of MORC2 results in chromatin decompaction at these target loci, which is concomitant with a loss of H3K9me3 deposition and transcriptional derepression. The ATPase activity of MORC2 is critical for HUSH-mediated silencing, and the most common alteration affecting the ATPase domain in CMT patients (p.Arg252Trp) hyperactivates HUSH-mediated repression in neuronal cells.

We used next-generation sequencing (NGS), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and average nucleotide identity (ANI) to investigate the relationship between these species. The type strains of Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium caprae, Mycobacterium microti and Mycobacterium pinnipedii were sequenced via NGS. Pairwise dDDH and ANI comparisons between these, previously sequenced MTBC type strain genomes (including 'Mycobacterium canettii', 'Mycobacterium mungi' and 'Mycobacterium orygis') and M. tuberculosis H37Rv<sup>T</sup> were performed. Further, all available genome sequences in GenBank for species in or putatively in the MTBC were compared to H37Rv<sup>T</sup>. Pairwise results indicated that all of the type strains of the species are extremely closely related to each other (dDDH: 91.2-99.2 %, ANI: 99.21-99.92 %), greatly exceeding the respective species delineation thresholds, thus indicating that they belong to the same species. Results from the GenBank genomes indicate that all the strains examined are within the circumscription of H37Rv<sup>T</sup> (dDDH: 83.5-100 %). We, therefore, formally propose a union of the species of the MTBC as M. tuberculosis. M. africanum, M. bovis, M. caprae, M. microti and M. pinnipedii are reclassified as later heterotypic synonyms of M. tuberculosis. 'M. canettii', 'M. mungi', and 'M. orygis' are classified as strains of the species M. tuberculosis.

29136504,Arid1a promotes tumor initiation but restrains progression and metastasis in liver cancer [RNA-seq],"ARID1A, an SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene, is commonly mutated in cancer and hypothesized to be tumor suppressive. In some hepatocellular carcinoma patients, ARID1A was highly expressed in primary tumors but not in metastatic lesions, suggesting that ARID1A can be lost after initiation. Mice with liver-specific homozygous or heterozygous Arid1a loss were resistant to tumor initiation while ARID1A overexpression accelerated initiation. In contrast, homozygous or heterozygous Arid1a loss in established tumors accelerated progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, gain of Arid1a function promoted initiation by increasing CYP450-mediated oxidative stress, while loss of Arid1a within tumors decreased chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription of genes associated with migration, invasion, and metastasis.

32056496,Developmental Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Asymmetry Between Mouse Placenta and Embryo,"In early embryos, DNA methylation is remodelled to initiate the developmental program but for mostly unknown reasons, methylation marks are acquired unequally between embryonic and placental cells. To better understand this, we generated high-resolution DNA methylation maps of mouse mid-gestation (E10.5) embryo and placenta. We uncovered specific subtypes of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that contribute directly to the developmental asymmetry existing between mid-gestation embryonic and placental DNA methylation patterns. We show that the asymmetry occurs rapidly during the acquisition of marks in the post-implanted conceptus (E3.5-E6.5), and that these patterns are long-lasting across subtypes of DMRs throughout prenatal development and in somatic tissues. We reveal that at the peri-implantation stages, the <i>de novo</i> methyltransferase activity of DNMT3B is the main driver of methylation marks on asymmetric DMRs, and that DNMT3B can largely compensate for lack of DNMT3A in the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm, whereas DNMT3A can only partially compensate in the absence of DNMT3B. However, as development progresses and as DNMT3A becomes the principal <i>de novo</i> methyltransferase, the compensatory DNA methylation mechanism of DNMT3B on DMRs becomes less effective.","['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Epigenome', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'DNA methylation', 'DNA translation', 'Methylation calling', 'Embryo report', 'Mammals', 'Embryology', 'Epigenomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Genome map', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Plant biology', 'Molecular replacement']"
28486108,Expression data from NB4 control shRNA cells and NB4 TRIB3 shRNA cells,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is driven by the oncoprotein PML-RARα, which antagonizes myeloid differentiation and promotes APL-initiating cell self-renewal. Combined all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or chemotherapy dramatically improves the prognosis of APL patients. Here we report that expression of pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) associates positively with APL progression and therapeutic resistance. The elevated TRIB3 expression promotes APL by interacting with PML-RARα and suppressing its sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation. This represses PML nuclear body assembly, p53-mediated senescence, and cell differentiation, and supports cellular self-renewal. Genetically inhibiting TRIB3 expression or combination of a peptide disturbing TRIB3/PML-RARα interaction with ATRA/As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> eradicates APL by accelerating PML-RARα degradation.

28514650,The INO80 complex removes H2A.Z to promote presynaptic filament formation during homologous recombination,"The INO80 complex (INO80-C) is an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome remodeler that acts in transcription, replication, and genome stability. It is required for resistance against genotoxic agents and is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). However, the causes of the HR defect in INO80-C mutant cells are controversial. Here, we unite previous findings using a system to study HR with high spatial resolution in budding yeast. We find that INO80-C has at least two distinct functions during HR-DNA end resection and presynaptic filament formation. Importantly, the second function is linked to the histone variant H2A.Z. In the absence of H2A.Z, presynaptic filament formation and HR are restored in INO80-C-deficient mutants, suggesting that presynaptic filament formation is the crucial INO80-C function during HR.","['DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Histones/*metabolism', '*Homologous Recombination', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', 'Replication Protein A/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Synapses/metabolism']","['DNA', 'dna', 'DNA structure', 'Histogram', 'Recombination detection', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Gene family report', 'Kinase name', 'protein', 'Protein identification', 'Protein modification ID', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Proteins', 'Protein accession', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Chemical formula']"

To date, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is the standard method for quantifying changes in alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale. Understanding the current limitations of RNA-seq is crucial for reliable analysis and the lack of high quality, comprehensive transcriptomes for most species, including model organisms such as Arabidopsis, is a major constraint in accurate quantification of transcript isoforms. To address this, we designed a novel pipeline with stringent filters and assembled a comprehensive Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) containing 82,190 non-redundant transcripts from 34 212 genes. Extensive experimental validation showed that AtRTD2 and its modified version, AtRTD2-QUASI, for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms, outperform other available transcriptomes in RNA-seq analysis. This strategy can be implemented in other species to build a pipeline for transcript-level expression and alternative splicing analyses.","['*Alternative Splicing', 'Arabidopsis/*genetics', '*Genes, Insect', 'Genetic Variation', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Untranslated', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptome']","['RNA splicing', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Sequence merging', 'Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Genes and proteins resources', 'Disease genes and proteins', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'DNA variation', 'Proteomics', 'Proteomics experiment', 'Proteogenomics', 'DNA translation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'Citation', 'Data reference', 'Reference identification', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"

To understand how a tailored response is coordinated, we examined the inflammatory response elicited in mouse macrophages by ionizing radiation (IR). RNA-sequencing studies revealed that most radiation-induced genes were strongly dependent on only one of a small number of sensors and signaling pathways, notably the DNA damage-induced kinase ATM, which regulated many IR-response genes, including interferon response genes, via an atypical IRF1-dependent, STING-independent mechanism. Moreover, small, defined sets of genes activated by p53 and NRF2 accounted for the selective response to radiation in comparison to a microbial inducer of inflammation. Our findings reveal that genes comprising an environmental response are activated by defined sensing mechanisms with a high degree of selectivity, and they identify distinct components of the radiation response that might be susceptible to therapeutic perturbation.","['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferons/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic/radiation effects', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']","['Protein report', 'Proteins', 'Protein report format', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Mutation ID', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'protein', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Radiation hybrid map', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence signature map', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'Introns', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein residue interactions', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Transcription factor name', 'Image metadata', 'Radiation Hybrid Mapping', 'RH scores', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Alpha diversity data', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Transcription regulatory sequence analysis', 'trans-regulatory element prediction', 'Tumor annotation', 'Protein expression', 'Protein active sites', 'Protein databases']"

34751409,Targeted RNA-Seq of Human Lymphoma Cell Line,"Promoter methylation represents one of the major epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the regulation of gene expression. Hypomethylating drugs are currently approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and some studies have recently been carried out on diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a type of Non‑Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 in mediating the epigenetic regulation of some key targets previously emerged as hypermethylated in Non‑Hodgkin lymphoma. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, genome‑wide arrays and methylation‑specific PCR were used to determine the level of methylation of specific targets. Gene silencing, gene expression and immunoblotting were used to investigate the role of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in lymphoma cells. The present study showed that lymphoma cell lines displayed a completely different methylation profile on selected targets compared with primary B lymphocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 5'‑aza‑cytidine (5AZA) and 5'‑aza‑2‑deoxycitidine (decitabine) exerted their activity through, at least in part, mechanisms independent of DNMT1 downregulation. Despite a global hypomethylating effect of 5AZA and decitabine, DNMT1 was not found to be necessary to maintain the hypermethylation of Krüppel‑like factor 4 (KLF4), death associated protein 1 (DAPK1) and spastic paraplegia 20 (<i>SPG20</i>). <i>SPG20</i> was found to be a completely methylated target in all the tested cell lines, but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting its association with malignancy. The highest methylation was clustered upstream of the transcription starting site in a panel of 28 DLBCL cell lines and the results were unaffected by the silencing of DNMT1 expression. These data demonstrated the epigenetic regulation of <i>SPG20</i> in lymphoid cells and identified a number of novel markers associated with lymphomas that deserve further investigation.","['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*genetics', 'Decitabine/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4/drug effects/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/*genetics']","['Metabolites', 'Cell cycle', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'DNA methylation', 'DNA translation', 'Methylation calling', 'Rate of association', 'Image metadata', 'Citation', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'Genome resequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession']"

Here we identify MLLT3 (also known as AF9) as a crucial regulator of HSCs that is highly enriched in human fetal, neonatal and adult HSCs, but downregulated in culture. Depletion of MLLT3 prevented the maintenance of transplantable human haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSPCs) in culture, whereas stabilizing MLLT3 expression in culture enabled more than 12-fold expansion of transplantable HSCs that provided balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Similar to endogenous MLLT3, overexpressed MLLT3 localized to active promoters in HSPCs, sustained levels of H3K79me2 and protected the HSC transcriptional program in culture. MLLT3 thus acts as HSC maintenance factor that links histone reader and modifying activities to modulate HSC gene expression, and may provide a promising approach to expand HSCs for transplantation.","['Animals', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell line report', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Transposon prediction', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction']"

We utilized machine-learning methods to identify sequence-based and positional features that distinguish phasiRNAs in rice and maize from other small RNAs (sRNAs). We developed Random Forest classifiers that can distinguish reproductive phasiRNAs from other sRNAs in complex sets of sequencing data, utilizing sequence-based (k-mers) and features describing position-specific sequence biases. The classification performance attained is > 80% in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicted value. Feature selection identified important features in both ends of phasiRNAs. We demonstrated that phasiRNAs have strand specificity and position-specific nucleotide biases potentially influencing AGO sorting; we also predicted targets to infer functions of phasiRNAs, and computationally assessed their sequence characteristics relative to other sRNAs. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning methods effectively identify phasiRNAs despite the lack of characteristic features typically present in precursor loci of other small RNAs, such as sequence conservation or structural motifs. The 5'-end features we identified provide insights into AGO-phasiRNA interactions.

Therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant DNA methylation in ovarian tumors have shown promise in the clinic, but the effects of epigenetic therapy on the tumor microenvironment are understudied. Here, we examined the effect of adipocytes on OC cell behavior in culture and impact of targeting DNA methylation in adipocytes on OC metastasis. The presence of adipocytes increased OC cell migration and invasion, and proximal and direct coculture of adipocytes increased OC proliferation alone or after treatment with carboplatin. Treatment of adipocytes with hypomethylating agent guadecitabine decreased migration and invasion of OC cells toward adipocytes. Subcellular protein fractionation of adipocytes treated with guadecitabine revealed decreased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) levels even in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitor, aphidicolin. Methyl-Capture- and RNA-sequencing analysis of guadecitabine-treated adipocytes revealed derepression of tumor-suppressor genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibitors. <i>SUSD2</i>, a secreted tumor suppressor downregulated by promoter CpG island methylation in adipocytes, was upregulated after guadecitabine treatment, and recombinant SUSD2 decreased OC cell migration and invasion. Integrated analysis of the methylomic and transcriptomic data identified pathways associated with inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and fatty acid α-oxidation, suggesting a possible mechanism of how epigenetic therapy of adipocytes decreases metastasis. In conclusion, the effect of DNMT inhibitor on fully differentiated adipocytes suggests that hypomethylating agents may affect the tumor microenvironment to decrease cancer cell metastasis.<b>Implications:</b> Epigenetic targeting of tumor microenvironment can affect metastatic behavior of ovarian cancer cells. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 16(8); 1226-40. ©2018 AACR</i>.","['Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*genetics/pathology', 'Epigenomics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']","['Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Parsing', 'Protein variants', 'Variant classification', 'Variant calling']"
29155828,Genome-wide profile of Notch pathway co-repressors and their role in shaping the Notch response,"Repressors are frequently deployed to limit the transcriptional response to signalling pathways. For example, several co-repressors interact directly with the DNA-binding protein CSL and are proposed to keep target genes silenced in the absence of Notch activity. However, the scope of their contributions remains unclear. To investigate co-repressor activity in the context of this well defined signalling pathway, we have analysed the genome-wide binding profile of the best-characterized CSL co-repressor in Drosophila, Hairless, and of a second CSL interacting repressor, SMRTER. As predicted there was significant overlap between Hairless and its CSL DNA-binding partner, both in Kc cells and in wing discs, where they were predominantly found in chromatin with active enhancer marks. However, while the Hairless complex was widely present at some Notch regulated enhancers in the wing disc, no binding was detected at others, indicating that it is not essential for silencing per se. Further analysis of target enhancers confirmed differential requirements for Hairless. SMRTER binding significantly overlapped with Hairless, rather than complementing it, and many enhancers were apparently co-bound by both factors. Our analysis indicates that the actions of Hairless and SMRTER gate enhancers to Notch activity and to Ecdysone signalling respectively, to ensure that the appropriate levels and timing of target gene expression are achieved.","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/metabolism', 'Ecdysone/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Genomics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein expression', 'DNA binding site prediction', 'Protein domains', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Genomics', 'Phylogenomics', 'Structural genomics', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Nucleic acid sequences', 'Nucleic acid sequence record', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"
27015005,Schlöppnerbrunnen omics,"Dissimilatory sulfate reduction in peatlands is sustained by a cryptic sulfur cycle and effectively competes with methanogenic degradation pathways. In a series of peat soil microcosms incubated over 50 days, we identified bacterial consortia that responded to small, periodic additions of individual fermentation products (formate, acetate, propionate, lactate or butyrate) in the presence or absence of sulfate. Under sulfate supplementation, net sulfate turnover (ST) steadily increased to 16-174 nmol cm(-3) per day and almost completely blocked methanogenesis. 16S rRNA gene and cDNA amplicon sequencing identified microorganisms whose increases in ribosome numbers strongly correlated to ST. Natively abundant (⩾0.1% estimated genome abundance) species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed no significant response to sulfate. In contrast, low-abundance OTUs responded significantly to sulfate in incubations with propionate, lactate and butyrate. These OTUs included members of recognized sulfate-reducing taxa (Desulfosporosinus, Desulfopila, Desulfomonile, Desulfovibrio) and also members of taxa that are either yet unknown sulfate reducers or metabolic interaction partners thereof. Most responsive OTUs markedly increased their ribosome content but only weakly increased in abundance. Responsive Desulfosporosinus OTUs even maintained a constantly low population size throughout 50 days, which suggests a novel strategy of rare biosphere members to display activity. Interestingly, two OTUs of the non-sulfate-reducing genus Telmatospirillum (Alphaproteobacteria) showed strongly contrasting preferences towards sulfate in butyrate-amended microcosms, corroborating that closely related microorganisms are not necessarily ecologically coherent. We show that diverse consortia of low-abundance microorganisms can perform peat soil sulfate reduction, a process that exerts control on methane production in these climate-relevant ecosystems.","['Bacteria/classification/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ecosystem', 'Fermentation', 'Methane/metabolism', '*Microbial Consortia', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Soil Microbiology', 'Sulfates/*metabolism', 'Sulfur/metabolism']","['Protein signal peptide detection (bacteria)', 'GTrack', 'GSuite', 'BTrack', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Mutation annotation (functional)', 'Representative sequence identification', 'Gene methylation analysis', 'DNA methylation', 'Laboratory techniques', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Reaction data', 'Microbiology', 'Biology', 'Fate map']"

High-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) were used to model LSS conditions to characterize changes in environmental stress resistance and adhesion/invasive properties. Low-shear stress-grown cultures exhibited enhanced thermal and oxidative stress resistance as well as increased adherence to Caco-2 cells, but no changes in invasion were observed. An AIEC rpoS mutant was constructed to examine the impact of this global stress regulator. The absence of RpoS under LSS conditions resulted in increased sensitivity to oxidative stress while adherence levels were elevated in comparison with the wild-type strain. TnphoA mutagenesis and rpoS complementation were carried out on the rpoS mutant to identify those factors involved in the LSS-induced adherence phenotype. Mutagenesis results revealed that one insertion disrupted the tnaB gene (encoding tryptophan permease) and the rpoS tnaB double mutant exhibited decreased adherence under LSS. Complementation of the tnaB gene, or medium supplemented with exogenous indole, restored adhesion of the rpoS tnaB mutant under LSS conditions.

This is especially evident in recipients with high levels of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies. Here we investigated the mechanisms of liver's protective impact using gene expression in the kidney allograft. Select solitary kidney transplant or simultaneous liver-kidney transplant recipients were retrospectively reviewed and separated into four groups: 16 cross-match negative kidney transplants, 15 cross-match positive kidney transplants, 12 cross-match negative simultaneous liver-kidney transplants, and nine cross-match-positive simultaneous liver-kidney transplants. Surveillance biopsies of cross-match-positive kidney transplants had increased expression of genes associated with donor-specific antigens, inflammation, and endothelial cell activation compared to cross-match-negative kidney transplants. These changes were not found in cross-match-positive simultaneous liver-kidney transplant biopsies when compared to cross-match-negative simultaneous liver-kidney transplants. In addition, simultaneously transplanting a liver markedly increased renal expression of genes associated with tissue integrity/metabolism, regardless of the cross-match status. While the expression of inflammatory gene sets in cross-match-positive simultaneous liver-kidney transplants was not completely reduced to the level of cross-match-negative kidney transplants, the downstream effects of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies were blocked. Thus, simultaneous liver-kidney transplants can have a profound impact on the kidney allograft, not only by decreasing inflammation and avoiding endothelial cell activation in cross-match-positive recipients, but also by increasing processes associated with tissue integrity/metabolism by unknown mechanisms.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Kidney/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*methods', 'Liver/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Young Adult']","['Scents', 'Scent annotation', 'MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'X-ray diffraction', 'BioPAX', 'Biophysics', 'BioPax term', 'Paediatrics', 'ChIP-seq', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Selection detection', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Peptide immunogenicity prediction', 'Statistical calculation', 'DNA testing', 'Gene set testing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Transposon prediction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'DNA translation', 'MAT', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mass spectrum', 'Plant biology']"
28646221,Genome-wide analysis of the altered gene expression in the transgenic mice ectopically expressing the human SRY.,"Sexual dimorphisms are prevalent in development, physiology and diseases in humans. Currently, the contributions of the genes on the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in these processes are uncertain. Using a transgene activation system, the human sex-determining gene hSRY is activated in the single-cell embryos of the mouse. Pups with hSRY activated (hSRY<sup>ON</sup>) are born of similar sizes as those of non-activated controls. However, they retard significantly in postnatal growth and development and all die of multi-organ failure before two weeks of age. Pathological and molecular analyses indicate that hSRY<sup>ON</sup> pups lack innate suckling activities, and develop fatty liver disease, arrested alveologenesis in the lung, impaired neurogenesis in the brain and occasional myocardial fibrosis and minimized thymus development. Transcriptome analysis shows that, in addition to those unique to the respective organs, various cell growth and survival pathways and functions are differentially affected in the transgenic mice. These observations suggest that ectopic activation of a Y-located SRY gene could exert male-specific effects in development and physiology of multiple organs, thereby contributing to sexual dimorphisms in normal biological functions and disease processes in affected individuals.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Ectopic Gene Expression', 'Embryonic Development/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Targeting', '*Genes, Lethal', 'Growth Disorders/*genetics/mortality', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Sex Determination Processes/*genetics', 'Sex-Determining Region Y Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes', 'Y Chromosome']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'Protein targeting and localisation', 'miRNA target prediction', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'Protein disorder prediction', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Gene order', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Alternative splicing prediction', 'Annotation track', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Structure determination', 'Annotation processing', 'Recombination detection', 'protein', 'Protein region signature', 'Protein interaction prediction', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Gene transcription', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene transcript report', 'Chromosome name', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Chromosome report']"
29276154,Modeling the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A using patient-specific iPSCs,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), one of the most frequent inherited peripheral neuropathies, is associated with PMP22 gene duplication. Previous studies of CMT1A mainly relied on rodent models, and it is not yet clear how PMP22 overexpression leads to the phenotype in patients. Here, we generated the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines from two CMT1A patients as an in vitro cell model. We found that, unlike the normal control cells, CMT1A hiPSCs rarely generated Schwann cells through neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Instead, CMT1A NCSCs produced numerous endoneurial fibroblast-like cells in the Schwann cell differentiation system, and similar results were obtained in a PMP22-overexpressing iPSC model. Therefore, despite the demyelination-remyelination and/or dysmyelination theory for CMT1A pathogenesis, developmental disabilities of Schwann cells may be considered as an underlying cause of CMT1A. Our results may have important implications for the uncovering of the underlying mechanism and the development of a promising therapeutic strategy for CMT1A neuropathy.","['*Cell Differentiation', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Myelin Proteins/metabolism', 'Schwann Cells/*metabolism/pathology']","['Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Regenerative medicine', 'MAT', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'Protein data']"

Here, tests performed by the utilization of our designed specific SOD1 inhibitor LD100 on cancer and normal cells reveal that the signaling pathways and their crosstalk to support cancer cell growth are repressed, but the signaling pathways to promote cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are stimulated by specific SOD1 inhibition-mediated ROS changes. These regulated pathways constitute an ROS signaling network that determines the fate of cancer cells. This ROS signaling network is also regulated in SOD1 knockdown cells. These findings might facilitate disclosure of action mechanisms by copper-chelating anticancer agents and design of SOD1-targeting and ROS signaling pathway-interfering anticancer small molecules.","['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Peroxynitrous Acid/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']","['Cell cycle', 'Psiblast checkpoint file', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Inhibitor annotation', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mitochondria', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Plasmid map', 'Plasmid identifier', 'Protein ID (PeroxiBase)', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Pathology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'PubChem bioassay ID']"

Here, we show the presence of internal m<sup>7</sup>G sites within mammalian mRNA. We then performed transcriptome-wide profiling of internal m<sup>7</sup>G methylome using m<sup>7</sup>G-MeRIP sequencing (MeRIP-seq). To map this modification at base resolution, we developed a chemical-assisted sequencing approach that selectively converts internal m<sup>7</sup>G sites into abasic sites, inducing misincorporation at these sites during reverse transcription. This base-resolution m<sup>7</sup>G-seq enabled transcriptome-wide mapping of m<sup>7</sup>G in human tRNA and mRNA, revealing distribution features of the internal m<sup>7</sup>G methylome in human cells.

30982741,Impact of depletion of groucho or notch on transcription in Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs).,"Intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation in the Drosophila midgut requires Delta/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, which separates the fate of ISCs from differentiating enteroblasts (EBs). Although a canonical Notch signaling cascade is involved in the lateral inhibition, its regulation at the transcriptional level is still unclear. Here we show that the establishment of lateral inhibition between ISC-EB requires two evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) that act differently. Gro functions in EBs with E(spl)-C proteins to suppress Delta expression, inhibit cell-cycle re-entry, and promote cell differentiation, whereas CtBP functions specifically in ISCs to mediate transcriptional repression of Su(H) targets and maintain ISC fate. Interestingly, several E(spl)-C genes are also expressed in ISCs that cooperate with Gro to inhibit cell proliferation. Collectively, our study demonstrates separable and cell-type-specific functions of Gro and CtBP in a lateral inhibition process that controls the proliferation and differentiation of tissue stem cells.","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Intestines/cytology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genetic engineering', 'Genetics', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential binding analysis', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell line report', 'Cell biology', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'DNA testing', 'Statistical calculation', 'Gene set testing', 'RNA sequence', 'RNA', 'rna', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein report', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide', 'Regenerative medicine', 'System metadata', 'cel']"

Here we report a 2.4-Gb draft genome sequence of a female Chinese hamster, Cricetulus griseus, harboring 24,044 genes. We also resequenced and analyzed the genomes of six CHO cell lines from the CHO-K1, DG44 and CHO-S lineages. This analysis identified hamster genes missing in different CHO cell lines, and detected >3.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 551,240 indels and 7,063 copy number variations. Many mutations are located in genes with functions relevant to bioprocessing, such as apoptosis.

Here, we show that, following ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, NSCs enter irreversible proliferative arrest with features of cellular senescence. This is characterized by increased cytokine secretion, loss of stem cell markers, and astrocytic differentiation. We demonstrate that BMP2 is necessary to induce expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP in irradiated NSCs via a noncanonical signaling pathway engaging JAK-STAT. This is promoted by ATM and antagonized by p53. Using a SOX2-Cre reporter mouse model for cell-lineage tracing, we demonstrate irradiation-induced NSC differentiation in vivo.

To identify early signaling events in the response of the heart to cigarette smoke exposure within the setting of obesity, we exposed normal weight and high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to repeated inhaled doses of mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke administered over a two week period, monitoring effects on both cardiac and pulmonary transcriptomes. MS smoke (250 μg wet total particulate matter (WTPM)/L, 5 h/day) exposures elicited robust cellular and molecular inflammatory responses in the lung with 1466 differentially expressed pulmonary genes (p < 0.01) in normal weight animals and a much-attenuated response (463 genes) in the hearts of the same animals. In contrast, exposures to SS smoke (85 μg WTPM/L) with a CO concentration equivalent to that of MS smoke (~250 CO ppm) induced a weak pulmonary response (328 genes) but an extensive cardiac response (1590 genes). SS smoke and to a lesser extent MS smoke preferentially elicited hypoxia- and stress-responsive genes as well as genes predicting early changes of vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, precursors of cardiovascular disease. The most sensitive smoke-induced cardiac transcriptional changes of normal weight mice were largely absent in DIO mice after smoke exposure, while genes involved in fatty acid utilization were unaffected. At the same time, smoke exposure suppressed multiple proteome maintenance genes induced in the hearts of DIO mice. Together, these results underscore the sensitivity of the heart to SS smoke and reveal adaptive responses in healthy individuals that are absent in the setting of high fat diet and obesity.","['Animals', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Obese', 'Obesity/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco/*chemistry', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology', 'Pathology', 'Rare diseases', 'Version information', 'Information extraction', 'Sequence version', 'MAT', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Histogram', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'Gene expression profiling']"
23431003,Improving plant growth performances through the exploitation of Sinorhizobium meliloti pangenome,"Many bacterial species, such as the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, are characterized by open pangenomes and contain multipartite genomes consisting of a chromosome and other large-sized replicons, such as chromids, megaplasmids, and plasmids. The evolutionary forces in both functional and structural aspects that shape the pangenome of species with multipartite genomes are still poorly understood. Therefore, we sequenced the genomes of 10 new S. meliloti strains, analyzed with four publicly available additional genomic sequences. Results indicated that the three main replicons present in these strains (a chromosome, a chromid, and a megaplasmid) partly show replicon-specific behaviors related to strain differentiation. In particular, the pSymB chromid was shown to be a hot spot for positively selected genes, and, unexpectedly, genes resident in the pSymB chromid were also found to be more widespread in distant taxa than those located in the other replicons. Moreover, through the exploitation of a DNA proximity network, a series of conserved ""DNA backbones"" were found to shape the evolution of the genome structure, with the rest of the genome experiencing rearrangements. The presented data allow depicting a scenario where the pSymB chromid has a distinctive role in intraspecies differentiation and in evolution through positive selection, whereas the pSymA megaplasmid mostly contributes to structural fluidity and to the emergence of new functions, indicating a specific evolutionary role for each replicon in the pangenome evolution.","['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Evolution, Molecular', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', '*Replicon', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sinorhizobium meliloti/classification/*genetics']","['Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Molecular evolution', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Molecular data', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Genome visualisation', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Selection detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Genetic map']"

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover genomic alterations during BE pathogenesis and progression to EAC, but treatment-naive surgical specimens are scarce. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of using widely available endoscopic mucosal biopsies for successful NGS, using samples obtained from a BE 'progressor'. Paired-end whole-genome NGS was performed on the Illumina platform using libraries generated from mucosal biopsies of normal squamous epithelium (NSE), BE and EAC obtained from a patient who progressed to adenocarcinoma during endoscopic surveillance. Selective validation studies, including Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry and functional assays, were performed to confirm the NGS findings. NGS identified somatic nonsense mutations of AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI like) (ARID1A) and PPIE and an additional 37 missense mutations in BE and/or EAC, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. ARID1A mutations were detected in 15% (3/20) high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC patients. Immunohistochemistry performed on an independent archival cohort demonstrated ARID1A protein loss in 0% (0/76), 4.9% (2/40), 14.3% (4/28), 16.0% (8/50) and 12.2% (12/98) of NSE, BE, low-grade dysplasia, HGD and EAC tissues, respectively, and was inversely associated with nuclear p53 accumulation (P=0.028). Enhanced cell growth, proliferation and invasion were observed on ARID1A knockdown in EAC cells. In addition, genes downstream of ARID1A that potentially contribute to the ARID1A knockdown phenotype were identified. Our studies establish the feasibility of using mucosal biopsies for NGS, which should enable the comparative analysis of larger 'progressor' versus 'non-progressor' cohorts. Further, we identify ARID1A as a novel tumor-suppressor gene in BE pathogenesis, reiterating the importance of aberrant chromatin in the metaplasia-dysplasia sequence.","['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Aged', 'Barrett Esophagus/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endoscopes', 'Epithelium/metabolism/pathology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'BioPAX', 'Biophysics', 'BioPax term', 'Plotting', 'Clustering profile plotting', 'Blot ID', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Generation', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'DNA-binding protein prediction', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'High-throughput sequencing', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Sequencing', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'MAT', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein sequence analysis', 'SNP detection', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'RNA sequence', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Reaction ID', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'Transcriptomics']"
28500237,Sequencing of ponatinib-resistant LC-2/ad derivatives (PR1 and PR2) and parental LC-2/ad cells,"Oncogenic rearrangements in <i>RET</i> are present in 1%-2% of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Ponatinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with low-nanomolar potency against the RET kinase domain. Here, we demonstrate that ponatinib exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in RET fusion-positive LC-2/ad lung adenocarcinoma cells and inhibits phosphorylation of the RET fusion protein and signaling through ERK1/2 and AKT. Using distinct dose escalation strategies, two ponatinib-resistant LC-2/ad cell lines, PR1 and PR2, were derived. PR1 and PR2 cell lines retained expression, but not phosphorylation of the RET fusion and lacked evidence of a resistance mutation in the RET kinase domain. Both resistant lines retained activation of the MAPK pathway. Next-generation RNA sequencing revealed an oncogenic NRAS p.Q61K mutation in the PR1 cell. PR1 cell proliferation was preferentially sensitive to siRNA knockdown of NRAS compared with knockdown of RET, more sensitive to MEK inhibition than the parental line, and NRAS dependence was maintained in the absence of chronic RET inhibition. Expression of NRAS p.Q61K in RET fusion expressing TPC1 cells conferred resistance to ponatinib. PR2 cells exhibited increased expression of EGFR and AXL. EGFR inhibition decreased cell proliferation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT in PR2 cells, but not LC-2/ad cells. Although AXL inhibition enhanced PR2 sensitivity to afatinib, it was unable to decrease cell proliferation by itself. Thus, EGFR and AXL cooperatively rescued signaling from RET inhibition in the PR2 cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that resistance to ponatinib in RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma is mediated by bypass signaling mechanisms that result in restored RAS/MAPK activation. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 16(8); 1623-33. ©2017 AACR</i>.","['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase']","['Kinase name', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Generation', 'Operation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Data management', 'Gene ID', 'Pain medicine', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecules', 'Operating system name', 'System metadata', 'Sequence signature map', 'Protein membrane regions', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Protein report (membrane protein)', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Gene ID (EcoGene)', 'Oncology', 'geneseq', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein databases']"

Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy concomitantly rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel contact domain boundaries. While transcription and replication coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs at loop anchors are transcription-, replication-, and cell type- independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in acute leukemias and prostate cancers.  Thus, loop anchors serve as preferred and promiscuous fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements.

28446595,DNA damage signaling mediates the functional antagonism between replicative senescence and terminal muscle differentiation,"The molecular determinants of muscle progenitor impairment to regenerate aged muscles are currently unclear. We show that, in a mouse model of replicative senescence, decline in muscle satellite cell-mediated regeneration coincides with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) and impaired ability to differentiate into myotubes. Inhibition of DDR restored satellite cell differentiation ability. Moreover, in replicative human senescent fibroblasts, DDR precluded MYOD-mediated activation of the myogenic program. A DDR-resistant MYOD mutant could overcome this barrier by resuming cell cycle progression. Likewise, DDR inhibition could also restore MYOD's ability to activate the myogenic program in human senescent fibroblasts. Of note, we found that cell cycle progression is necessary for the DDR-resistant MYOD mutant to reverse senescence-mediated inhibition of the myogenic program. These data provide the first evidence of DDR-mediated functional antagonism between senescence and MYOD-activated gene expression and indicate a previously unrecognized requirement of cell cycle progression for the activation of the myogenic program.","['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Muscle Development/genetics', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology/metabolism', 'MyoD Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myoblasts/*cytology/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell cycle', 'Carbon cycle', 'Cell type accession', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction', 'DNA', 'dna', 'Image', 'BLAST results', 'Tool name (BLAST)', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'Software engineering', 'Musculoskeletal medicine', 'protein', 'Protein data', 'Protein name', 'BLAST XML results format']"
22112458,"CP12 is a small nuclear encoded chloroplast protein that has been shown to form a complex with the Calvin cycle enzymes, PRK and GADPH. We have taken an antisense approach in order to address the importance of this regulatory protein on carbon assimilation. Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun with reduced levels of the CP12 protein, produced by leaf disc transformation with a full length tobacco CP12 cDNA, regulated by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and selection on kanamycin produced primary transformants whose progeny segregate for severity of the antisense CP12 phenotype. Because of the impact of the antisense reductions in CP12 on carbon assimilation, these plants have abnormal morphology of leaves, floral organs, greatly reduced fertility and markedly slower growth rates. Our hypothesis is that the phenotype is exposing the regulatory nature of the CP12 protein. Intermediates leaving the Calvin cycle are essential for the synthesis of hormones and perturbation of hormone balances is a potential source of the morphological and development effects observed in the CP12 antisense plants. Our objective is to understand the CP12 phenotype by identifying changes in gene expression occurring at key stages in the life cycle of the CP12 antisense plants.  CP12 antisense and wild type control plants for microarray analysis were germinated in a growth chamber in agar medium with 1% sucrose and 1/2 strength MS; with a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle at 25°C. At 20 days plants were transferred to a controlled environment greenhouse and grown in Fisons Levington F2 compost at 25°C, with light levels above 500 umol m-2 s-1 ;using supplementary lighting in a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. 3 independent sets of plants (both wild type and CP12 antisense) were grown for preparation of three independent biological replicate RNA samples.

PRK and GAPDH are inactivated when present in this complex, a process shown in vitro to be dependent upon oxidized CP12. Recently we reported on the importance of CP12 in vivo to higher plant metabolism using antisense suppression of CP12 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Our results indicated that while only minor changes in photosynthetic carbon fixation and in PRK and GAPDH activities were observed, striking changes in growth rates and morphology were seen.

28575647,YY1 haploinsufficiency causes an intellectual disability syndrome featuring transcriptional and chromatin dysfunction [ChIP-seq],"Yin and yang 1 (YY1) is a well-known zinc-finger transcription factor with crucial roles in normal development and malignancy. YY1 acts both as a repressor and as an activator of gene expression. We have identified 23 individuals with de novo mutations or deletions of YY1 and phenotypic features that define a syndrome of cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, intrauterine growth restriction, feeding problems, and various congenital malformations. Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation. Collectively, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of YY1 through dysregulation of key transcriptional regulators.","['Acetylation', 'Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Ontology', 'Haploinsufficiency/*genetics', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Hemizygote', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Domains', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*genetics']","['ACE', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Scent annotation', 'Scents', 'Sequence', 'Sequence database search (by sequence for primer sequences)', 'Sequence database name', 'Paediatrics', 'Immunoprecipitation experiment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'chrominfo', 'RNA immunoprecipitation', 'Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Mobile genetic element ID', 'Ontology', 'Ontology data', 'Ontology format', 'Haplotype map', 'Haplotype mapping', 'Phenotype name', 'Histogram', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Nucleic acid melting profile', 'MAT', 'Molecular modelling', 'Molecular data', 'Molecular model refinement', 'Mutation ID', 'DNA mutation', 'Mutation type', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein domains', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier']"

Low-M(r) polar metabolite analyses were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eighty-one identified metabolites and 416 unidentified mass spectral tags, characterized by retention time indices and specific mass fragments, were monitored. Cold shock influenced metabolism far more profoundly than heat shock. The steady-state pool sizes of 143 and 311 metabolites or mass spectral tags were altered in response to heat and cold shock, respectively. Comparison of heat- and cold-shock response patterns revealed that the majority of heat-shock responses were shared with cold-shock responses, a previously unknown relationship. Coordinate increases in the pool sizes of amino acids derived from pyruvate and oxaloacetate, polyamine precursors, and compatible solutes were observed during both heat and cold shock. In addition, many of the metabolites that showed increases in response to both heat and cold shock in this study were previously unlinked with temperature stress. This investigation provides new insight into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to thermal stress at the metabolite level, reveals relationships between heat- and cold-shock responses, and highlights the roles of known signaling molecules and protectants.","['Acclimatization/physiology', 'Arabidopsis/*metabolism', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/*physiology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Signal Transduction', '*Temperature']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'Text', 'Tree dating', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Nucleic acid melting temperature', 'Nucleic acid temperature profile', 'Signal transduction pathway report', 'DNA transduction map', 'Signal or transit peptide']"

J R Soc Interface 2010 Apr 6;7(45):651-65 19828503 , Abstract: The biochemical regulation of energy metabolism (EM) allows cells to modulate their energetic output depending on available substrates and requirements. To this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations or perfect adaptation.

A simplified analog of genetic regulatory networks, in vitro transcriptional circuits, provides a modular platform for the systematic construction of arbitrary circuits and requires only two essential enzymes, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and Escherichia coli ribonuclease H, to produce and degrade RNA signals. In this study, we design and experimentally demonstrate three transcriptional oscillators in vitro. First, a negative feedback oscillator comprising two switches, regulated by excitatory and inhibitory RNA signals, showed up to five complete cycles. To demonstrate modularity and to explore the design space further, a positive-feedback loop was added that modulates and extends the oscillatory regime. Finally, a three-switch ring oscillator was constructed and analyzed. Mathematical modeling guided the design process, identified experimental conditions likely to yield oscillations, and explained the system's robust response to interference by short degradation products.

22748295,"Sarma2012 - Interaction topologies of MAPK cascade (M2_K2_QSS_USEQ) The paper presents the various interaction topologies between the kinases and phosphatases of MAPK cascade. They are represented as M1, M2, M3 and M4. The kinases of the cascades are MKKK, MKK and MK, and Phos1, Phos2 and Phos3 are phosphatases of the system. All three kinases in a M1 type network have specific phosphatases Phos1, Phos2 and Phos3 for the dephosphorylation process. In a M2 type system, kinases MKKK and MKK are dephosphorylated by Phos1 and MK is dephosphorylated by Phos2. The architecture of system like M3 is such that MKKK gets dephosphorylated by Phos1, whereas Phos2 dephosphorylates both MKK and MK. Finally, the MAPK cascade exhibiting more complex design of interaction such as M4 is such that MKKK and MKK are dephosphorylated by Phos1 whereas MKK and MK are dephosphorylated by Phos2. In addition, as it is plausible that the kinases can sequester their respective phosphatases by binding to them, this is considered in the design of the systems (PSEQ-sequestrated system; USEQ-Unsequestrated system). The robustness of different interaction designs of the systems is checked, considering both MichaelisMenten type kinetics (K1) and elementary mass action kinetics (K2). In the living systems, the MAPK cascade transmit both short and long duration signals where short duration signals trigger proliferation and long duration signals trigger cell differentiation. These signal variants are considered to interpret the systems behaviour. It is also tested how the robustness and signal response behaviour of K2 models are affected when K2 assumes quasi steady state (QSS). The combinations of the above variants resulted in 40 models (MODEL1204280001-40). All these 40 models are available from BioModels Database . Models that correspond to type M4 with mass-action kinetics K2, in four condition 1) USEQ [ MODEL1204280020 - M4_K2_USEQ], 2) PSEQ [ MODEL1204280024 - M4_K2_PSEQ], 3) QSS_USEQ [ MODEL1204280036 - M4_K2_QSS_USEQ] and 4) QSS_PSEQ [ MODEL1204280040 - M4_K2_QSS_PSEQ] are available from the curated branch. The remaining 36 models can be accessed from the non-curated branch. This model [ MODEL1204280034 - M2_K2_QSS_USEQ] correspond to type M2 with mass action kinetics K2, in QSS (quasi steady state) and USEQ (Unsequestrated ) condition. This model can accessed from the non-curated branch of BioModels Database . This model is described in the article: Different designs of kinase-phosphatase interactions and phosphatase sequestration shapes the robustness and signal flow in the MAPK cascade. Sarma U, Ghosh I. BMC Syst Biol. 2012 Jul 2;6(1):82. Abstract: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The three layer mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade exhibits different designs of interactions between its kinases and phosphatases. While the sequential interactions between the three kinases of the cascade are tightly preserved, the phosphatases of the cascade, such as MKP3 and PP2A, exhibit relatively diverse interactions with their substrate kinases. Additionally, the kinases of the MAPK cascade can also sequester their phosphatases. Thus, each topologically distinct interaction design of kinases and phosphatases could exhibit unique signal processing characteristics, and the presence of phosphatase sequestration may lead to further fine tuning of the propagated signal. RESULTS: We have built four models of the MAPK cascade, each model with identical kinase-kinase interactions but unique kinases-phosphatases interactions. Our simulations unravelled that MAPK cascade's robustness to external perturbations is a function of nature of interaction between its kinases and phosphatases. The cascade's output robustness was enhanced when phosphatases were sequestrated by their target kinases. We uncovered a novel implicit/hidden negative feedback loop from the phosphatase MKP3 to its upstream kinase Raf-1, in a cascade resembling the B cell MAPK cascade. Notably, strength of the feedback loop was reciprocal to the strength of phosphatases' sequestration and stronger sequestration abolished the feedback loop completely. An experimental method to verify the presence of the feedback loop is also proposed. We further showed, when the models were activated by transient signal, memory (total time taken by the cascade output to reach its unstimulated level after removal of signal) of a cascade was determined by the specific designs of interaction among its kinases and phosphatases. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in interaction designs among the kinases and phosphatases can differentially shape the robustness and signal response behaviour of the MAPK cascade and phosphatase sequestration dramatically enhances the robustness to perturbations in each of the cascade. An implicit negative feedback loop was uncovered from our analysis and we found that strength of the negative feedback loop is reciprocally related to the strength of phosphatase sequestration. Duration of output phosphorylation in response to a transient signal was also found to be determined by the individual cascade's kinase-phosphatase interaction design.

21464939,"Gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells treated with Si-Wu-Tang, estradiol and ferulic acid","To pursue a systematic approach to discovery of mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we used microarrays, bioinformatics and the ""Connectivity Map"" (CMAP) to examine TCM-induced changes in gene expression. We demonstrated that this approach can be used to elucidate new molecular targets using a model TCM herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) which is widely used for women's health. The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with 0.1 µM estradiol or 2.56 mg/ml of SWT showed dramatic gene expression changes, while no significant change was detected for ferulic acid, a known bioactive compound of SWT. Pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes related to the treatment effect identified that expression of genes in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cytoprotective pathway was most significantly affected by SWT, but not by estradiol or ferulic acid. The Nrf2-regulated genes HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM, SLC7A11 and NQO1 were upregulated by SWT in a dose-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR. Consistently, treatment with SWT and its four herbal ingredients resulted in an increased antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity in MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of differentially expressed genes related to SWT treatment was used to compare with those of 1,309 compounds in the CMAP database. The CMAP profiles of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells showed an excellent match with SWT treatment, consistent with SWT's widely claimed use for women's diseases and indicating a phytoestrogenic effect. The CMAP profiles of chemopreventive agents withaferin A and resveratrol also showed high similarity to the profiles of SWT. This study identified SWT as an Nrf2 activator and phytoestrogen, suggesting its use as a nontoxic chemopreventive agent, and demonstrated the feasibility of combining microarray gene expression profiling with CMAP mining to discover mechanisms of actions and to identify new health benefits of TCMs.","['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Software']","['Plant biology', 'Protein variants', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Database', 'Protein databases', 'Sequence databases', 'Drug structure relationship map', 'Relation extraction', 'Drug report', 'Drugs and target structures', 'Enzyme ID', 'ENZYME enzyme report format', 'Enzyme name', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Gene report', 'Report', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Keyword', 'Medicine', 'Translational medicine', 'Pain medicine', 'Image metadata', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'Citation', 'Data reference', 'Reference identification', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'PCR experiment', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription', 'Software engineering']"
22573802,Affymetrix data from Populus nectaries versus leaves,"Many plant species grow extrafloral nectaries and produce nectar to attract carnivore arthropods as defenders against herbivores. Two nectary types that evolved with Populus trichocarpa (Ptr) and Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides (Ptt) were studied from their ecology down to the genes and molecules. Both nectary types strongly differ in morphology, nectar composition and mode of secretion, and defense strategy. In Ptt, nectaries represent constitutive organs with continuous merocrine nectar flow, nectary appearance, nectar production, and flow. In contrast, Ptr nectaries were found to be holocrine and inducible. Neither mechanical wounding nor the application of jasmonic acid, but infestation by sucking insects, induced Ptr nectar secretion. Thus, nectaries of Ptr and Ptt seem to answer the same threat by the use of different mechanisms.","['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Exocytosis/genetics', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile/metabolism', 'Flowers/*immunology/*parasitology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant/genetics', 'Herbivory/*physiology', 'Insecta/physiology', 'Larva/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Plant Leaves/parasitology/ultrastructure', 'Plant Nectar/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Populus/genetics/immunology/*parasitology/*physiology', 'Stress, Physiological']","['Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Protein sequence', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Analysis', 'Gene cluster', 'Sequence cluster ID (CluSTr)', 'Exome sequencing', 'Exome assembly', 'Cytoband position', 'Nucleic acids', 'Flow cell identifier', 'Power test', 'Primers', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG GENES gene report format', 'geneseq', 'PDB insertion code', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Oligonucleotide ID', 'Sequence analysis', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'TAR format', 'Population genetics', 'Population genomics', 'Physiology', 'Biological model accession', 'Mathematical model']"
21179027,Tissue-type specific estrogen signaling in breast and uterine cancer cells,"A major question in transcription factor (TF) biology is why a TF binds to only a small fraction of motif eligible binding sites in the genome. Using the estrogen receptor-α as a model system, we sought to explicitly define parameters that determine TF-binding site selection. By examining 12 genetic and epigenetic parameters, we find that an energetically favorable estrogen response element (ERE) motif sequence, co-occupancy by the TF FOXA1, the presence of the H3K4me1 mark and an open chromatin configuration in the pre-ligand state provide specificity for ER binding. These factors can model estrogen-induced ER binding with high accuracy (ROC-AUC=0.95 and 0.88 using different genomic backgrounds). Moreover, when assessed in another estrogen-responsive cell line, this model was highly predictive for ERα binding (ROC-AUC=0.86).

1260009,Nicotiana tabacum Organism overview,"Nicotiana tabacum is believed to have arisen after hybridization of Nicotiana sylvestris with a species in the Tomentosae section of the genus Nicotiana. Recent biochemical experiments have confirmed the conclusions from previous cytogenetic studies that N. sylvestris was the maternal parent and have indicated that Nicotiana tomentosiformis was the paternal parent. However, these studies did not take into account the possibility that a new species of Nicotiana, called K-12, discovered in South America in 1968, could also have been one of the parents. Fraction I proteins were purified from N. tabacum and its putative progenitors, and separated into large and small subunits. Chymotryptic peptides of each subunit were analyzed by ion exchange column chromatography with a gradient elution system. Among 38 resolved peaks of the large subunits, 2 peaks were found to be different among the putative species. Since only N. sylvestris showed an identical chromatogram with N. tabacum, N. sylvestris was concluded to be the maternal progenitor, as the genetic information for the large subunit of Fraction I protein was known to be inherited by the cytoplasmic mode. On the other hand, the small subunit of Fraction I protein is inherited by the Mendelian mode and therefore N. tabacum, an allopolyploid, could be expected to contain two types of small subunits, one derived from N. sylvestris and the other from a paternal progenitor. N. sylvestris lacks two of the 25 chymotryptic peptides of the small subunit of N. tabacum. Among 3 putative paternal progenitors, these two peaks appeared only in N. tomentosiformis, but not in Nicotiana otophora or K-12. Thus, N. tomentosiformis was concluded to be a paternal progenitor of N. tabacum. The conclusion was verified by comparing chymotryptic peptides of small subunits from three amphidiploids of N. sylvestris crossed with N. tomentosiformis, N. sylvestris crossed with N. otophora snd N. sylvestris crossed with K-12. The analytical results showed that only the progeny of N. sylvestris crossed with N. tomentosiformis contained the same small subunits as N. tabacium.","['Chymotrypsin', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', '*Plant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Plants/*metabolism', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Species Specificity', 'Tobacco/metabolism']","['Genetic mapping', 'Genetic variation', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Peptide ID', 'Peptide property', 'Peptide identifier', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Plant biology', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Toxicology', 'Medical toxicology', 'Species name', 'Species tree', 'SCOP species']"

A number of genes were up- and down-regulated specifically at 12 h, others at 24 h while others were up- and down-regulated at both time points. Similarly, some genes were specifically induced very close to the lesion while others in more distal tissue. Clustering of expression profiles resulting from other biotic and abiotic interactions with Arabidopsis indicated a large overlap in gene expression. This study highlighted a multitude of genes induced in Arabidopsis spatially and temporally following infection with B. cinerea providing an insight into key processes of defence against this pathogen.

21098105,Identification of Gene Products Involved in the Oxidative Stress Response of Moraxella catarrhalis: Evaluation of OxyR dependent Genes,"Moraxella catarrhalis is subjected to oxidative stress from both internal and environmental sources. A previous study (C. D. Pericone, K. Overweg, P. W. Hermans, and J. N. Weiser, Infect. Immun. 68:3990-3997, 2000) indicated that a wild-type strain of M. catarrhalis was very resistant to killing by exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The gene encoding OxyR, a LysR family transcriptional regulator, was identified and inactivated in M. catarrhalis strain O35E, resulting in an increase in sensitivity to killing by H₂O₂ in disk diffusion assays and a concomitant aerobic serial dilution effect. Genes encoding a predicted catalase (KatA) and an alkyl hydroperoxidase (AhpCF) showed dose-dependent upregulation in wild-type cells exposed to H₂O₂. DNA microarray and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses identified M. catarrhalis genes whose expression was affected by oxidative stress in an OxyR-dependent manner. Testing of M. catarrhalis O35E katA and ahpC mutants for their abilities to scavenge exogenous H₂O₂ showed that the KatA catalase was responsible for most of this activity in the wild-type parent strain. The introduction of the same mutations into M. catarrhalis strain ETSU-4 showed that the growth of a ETSU-4 katA mutant was markedly inhibited by the addition of 50 mM H₂O₂ but that this mutant could still form a biofilm equivalent to that produced by its wild-type parent strain.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Catalase/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/physiology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moraxella catarrhalis/*drug effects/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress/physiology']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'Database', 'Database ID', 'Catalogue ID', 'Deletion map', 'Deletion detection', 'Genetic mapping', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein hydrogen bonds', 'Hydrogen bond calculation', 'Protein hydrogen exchange rate', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'IDAT']"

11530848,SAGE profile of rat hippocampus mRNA from Wistar rats,"Using the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, we generated a gene expression profile of the rat hippocampus. A total of 76,790 SAGE tags was analyzed, allowing identification of 28,748 different tag species, each representing a unique mRNA transcript. The tags were divided into different abundancy classes, ranging from tags that were detected over 500 times to tags encountered only once in the 76,790 tags analyzed. The mRNA species detected more than 50 times represented 0.3% of the total number of unique tags while accounting for 22% of the total hippocampal mRNA mass. The majority of tags were encountered 5 times or less. The genes expressed at the highest levels were of mitochondrial origin, consistent with a high requirement for energy in neuronal tissue. At a lower level of expression, several neuron-specific transcripts were encountered, encoding various neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and turnover, ion channels and pumps, and synaptic components. Comparison of relative expression levels demonstrated that glutamate receptors are the most frequent neurotransmitter receptors expressed in the hippocampus, consistent with the important role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, while GABA receptors were present at approximately 10-fold lower levels. Several kinases were present including CaMKII, which was expressed at high levels, consistent with its being the most abundant protein in the spines of hippocampal pyramidal cells. This is the first extensive inventory of gene expression in the hippocampus and serves as a reference for future studies aimed at elucidating hippocampal transcriptional responses under various conditions.","['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hippocampus/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mathematics', 'Neurons/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Compound name', 'Phenomics', 'Chemical data format', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Processed microarray data', 'Gene expression report ID', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression QTL analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Mathematical model', 'NeuronDB ID', 'NeuroML', 'Neurology', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Mice or rats', 'Protein sequence repeats', 'Nucleic acid repeats', 'TAR format', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

Little is known about the stability of these epigenomes when related, but distinct genomes are brought together by intra-species hybridization. Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and their reciprocal hybrids were used as a model system to investigate the dynamics of histone modification patterns. The genome-wide distribution of histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 in the inbred parental accessions Col-0, C24 and Cvi and their hybrid offspring was compared by chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with genome tiling array hybridization. The analysis revealed that, in addition to DNA sequence polymorphisms, chromatin modification variations exist among accessions of A. thaliana. The range of these variations was higher for H3K27me3 (typically a repressive mark) than for H3K4me2 (typically an active mark). H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 were rather stable in response to intra-species hybridization, with mainly additive inheritance in hybrid offspring.

21853118,The consequences of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) depletion on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice,"Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are characterised by a decreased n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in hepatic phospholipids. The metabolic consequences of n-3 PUFA depletion in the liver are poorly understood. We have reproduced a drastic drop in n-3 PUFA among hepatic phospholipids by feeding C57Bl/6J mice for 3 months with an n-3 PUFA depleted diet (DEF) versus a control diet (CT), which only differed in the PUFA content. DEF mice exhibited hepatic insulin resistance (assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) and steatosis that was associated with a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and occurred despite a higher capacity for triglyceride secretion. Microarray and qPCR analysis of the liver tissue revealed higher expression of all the enzymes involved in lipogenesis in DEF mice compared to CT mice, as well as increased expression and activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Our data suggest that the activation of the liver X receptor pathway is involved in the overexpression of SREBP-1c, and this phenomenon cannot be attributed to insulin or to endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. In conclusion, n-3 PUFA depletion in liver phospholipids leads to activation of SREBP-1c and lipogenesis, which contributes to hepatic steatosis.","['Animals', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'Diet', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/genetics', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism', 'Fatty Liver/*genetics/pathology', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Insulin Resistance/*genetics', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics', 'Liver/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver X Receptors', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1/metabolism', 'Triglycerides/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'NET', 'mega', 'Nucleic acids', 'mega variant', 'Fate map', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Residue distance calculation', 'Sequence distance matrix', 'Drug metabolism', 'Metabolites', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Orpha number', 'Diffraction data reduction', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Lipids', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Database search results', 'BLAST results', 'Sequence search results', 'Transcriptional regulatory element prediction', 'Protein binding sites', 'trans-regulatory element prediction']"

Despite recent identification of metabolic alterations in this lethal malignancy, the metabolic dependencies of obesity-associated PDA remain unknown. Here we show that obesity-driven PDA exhibits accelerated growth and a striking transcriptional enrichment for pathways regulating nitrogen metabolism. We find that the mitochondrial form of arginase (ARG2), which hydrolyzes arginine into ornithine and urea, is induced upon obesity, and silencing or loss of ARG2 markedly suppresses PDA. In vivo infusion of <sup>15</sup>N-glutamine in obese mouse models of PDA demonstrates enhanced nitrogen flux into the urea cycle and infusion of <sup>15</sup>N-arginine shows that Arg2 loss causes significant ammonia accumulation that results from the shunting of arginine catabolism into alternative nitrogen repositories. Furthermore, analysis of PDA patient tumors indicates that ARG2 levels correlate with body mass index (BMI). The specific dependency of PDA on ARG2 rather than the principal hepatic enzyme ARG1 opens a therapeutic window for obesity-associated pancreatic cancer.Obesity is an established risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

27872309,"Examine the abundance and length of siRNAs produced by mutant Dicer-2 in vivo and in vitro in order to understand the mechanism by which Dicer-2 produces highly precise 21 nt siRNAs.
Examine the abundance and length of siRNAs produced by mutant Dicer-2 in vivo and in vitro","The enzyme Dicer produces small silencing RNAs such as micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In Drosophila, Dicer-1 produces ∼22-24-nt miRNAs from pre-miRNAs, whereas Dicer-2 makes 21-nt siRNAs from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). How Dicer-2 precisely makes 21-nt siRNAs with a remarkably high fidelity is unknown. Here we report that recognition of the 5'-monophosphate of a long dsRNA substrate by a phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ (Piwi, Argonaute, and Zwille/Pinhead) domain is crucial for the length fidelity, but not the efficiency, in 21-nt siRNA production. Loss of the length fidelity, meaning increased length heterogeneity of siRNAs, caused by point mutations in the phosphate-binding pocket of the Dicer-2 PAZ domain decreased RNA silencing activity in vivo, showing the importance of the high fidelity to make 21-nt siRNAs. We propose that the 5'-monophosphate of a long dsRNA substrate is anchored by the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain and the distance between the pocket and the RNA cleavage active site in the RNaseIII domain corresponds to the 21-nt pitch in the A-form duplex of a long dsRNA substrate, resulting in high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which Dicer-2 produces 21-nt siRNAs with a remarkably high fidelity for efficient RNA silencing.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'MicroRNAs', 'Phosphate-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA Helicases/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA Interference/*physiology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/metabolism/*physiology', 'Substrate Specificity']","['Protein sequence', 'Sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'RNA annotation format', 'miRNA target prediction', 'Nucleic acid features (microRNA)', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Protein domain', 'Protein domain ID', 'Helical net', 'Helical wheel', 'RNA', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Citation', 'Polypeptide chain ID', 'RNA structure', 'RNA-Seq', 'Small molecules', 'Small molecule data', 'Ribosome Profiling', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'DNA sense specification', 'Chemical formula']"

Disruptions to these cause a significant number of human birth defects, including ocular coloboma. We provide robust spatial-temporal staging and unique anatomical detail of optic fissure closure (OFC) in the embryonic chick, including evidence for roles of apoptosis and epithelial remodelling. We performed complementary transcriptomic profiling and show that <i>Netrin</i>-1 (<i>NTN1</i>) is precisely expressed in the chick fissure margin during fusion but is immediately downregulated after fusion. We further provide a combination of protein localisation and phenotypic evidence in chick, humans, mice and zebrafish that Netrin-1 has an evolutionarily conserved and essential requirement for OFC, and is likely to have an important role in palate fusion.

28366642,"Many proteins associate with elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), although the functions of most of them are still not well understood. Spt5 is an essential transcription elongation factor that binds directly to RNA polymerase and is conserved in prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes1. In eukaryotes, evidence suggests that Spt5 functions in transcription elongation by both RNA polymerases I and II, mRNA capping, mRNA splicing, and mRNA 3’ end formation2. However, the genome-wide requirement for Spt5 in transcription has not been extensively studied. To address this issue, we have comprehensively analyzed the consequences of Spt5 depletion on transcription by RNAPII in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using four genome-wide approaches: ChIP-seq, NET-seq, 4tU-seq, and RNA-seq. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of Spt5, RNAPII accumulates at a high level over the first ~500 bp of transcription units, suggesting that Spt5 is globally required to elongate past a barrier to transcription. This possibility is strongly supported by results showing that Spt5 is required for a normal level of RNA synthesis. In addition to these effects on sense-strand transcription, Spt5 depletion results in widespread convergent antisense transcription that initiates at approximately the same position as the sense-strand barrier. While the role of these antisense transcripts is unknown, the two that were tested control the distribution of RNAPII. Our results also show that Spt5 represses divergent antisense transcription, explaining why it has not been previously observed in S. pombe. Taken together, our results reveal a global and critical role for Spt5 in multiple classes of transcription by RNAPII.
Four pairs of biological replicates: with and without Spt5 C-terminal region, and before and after treatment to deplete Spt5 transcript and protein.","Spt5 is an essential and conserved factor that functions in transcription and co-transcriptional processes.

Our results demonstrate that Spt5 is crucial for a normal rate of RNA synthesis and distribution of RNAPII over transcription units. In the absence of Spt5, RNAPII localization changes dramatically, with reduced levels and a relative accumulation over the first ∼500 bp, suggesting that Spt5 is required for transcription past a barrier. Spt5 depletion also results in widespread antisense transcription initiating within this barrier region. Deletions of this region alter the distribution of RNAPII on the sense strand, suggesting that the barrier observed after Spt5 depletion is normally a site at which Spt5 stimulates elongation.

Intriguingly, we show that topologically associating domains (TADs) represent co-regulated subunits of chromatin and display considerable structural alterations as a result of changes in the cis-regulatory interaction landscape. The extensive rewiring of cis-regulatory interactions is closely associated with differential gene expression programs. Further, we demonstrate the regulatory role of Ebf1 and its downstream factor, Pax5, in chromatin reorganization and transcription regulation.

24364495,Not available,"Over the past years, phosphoproteomics has advanced to a prime tool in signaling research. Since then, an enormous amount of information about in vivo protein phosphorylation events has been collected providing a treasure trove for gaining a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in cell signaling. Yet, we still face the problem of how to achieve correct modification site localization. Here we use alternative fragmentation and different bioinformatics approaches for the identification and confident localization of phosphorylation sites. Phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed by multistage activation, collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), yielding complementary phosphopeptide identifications. We further found that MASCOT, OMSSA and Andromeda each identified a distinct set of phosphopeptides allowing the number of site assignments to be increased. The postsearch engine SLoMo provided confident phosphorylation site localization, whereas different versions of PTM-Score integrated in MaxQuant differed in performance. Based on high-resolution ETD and higher collisional dissociation (HCD) data sets from a large synthetic peptide and phosphopeptide reference library reported by Marx et al. [Nat. Biotechnol. 2013, 31 (6), 557-564], we show that an Andromeda/PTM-Score probability of 1 is required to provide an false localization rate (FLR) of 1% for HCD data, while 0.55 is sufficient for high-resolution ETD spectra. Additional analyses of HCD data demonstrated that for phosphotyrosine peptides and phosphopeptides containing two potential phosphorylation sites, PTM-Score probability cutoff values of <1 can be applied to ensure an FLR of 1%. Proper adjustment of localization probability cutoffs allowed us to significantly increase the number of confident sites with an FLR of <1%.Our findings underscore the need for the systematic assessment of FLRs for different score values to report confident modification site localization.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', '*Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']","['Protein sequence', 'Amino acid property', 'Amino acid name', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Format', 'Chromatographic alignment', 'Chromatogram visualisation', 'Computational biology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Biology', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'Molecular data', 'Sequence data', 'Molecular simulation data', 'Phosphorylation sites', 'Peptide ID', 'Protein signal peptides', 'DNA methylation', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Mass spectrometry data', 'Mass spectrum']"
28385888,"Reproduction requires pulsatile release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which regulates expression of the pituitary gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Fshb expression shows an inverted U-shaped response to GnRH pulse frequency. Increasing GnRH pulse frequency beyond ~one pulse/2 hours, despite increasing the average GnRH concentration, induces progressively less Fshb. To clarify regulatory mechanisms underlying Fshb gene control, we developed three biologically inspired and topologically distinct mathematical models. The models represent: 1) parallel activation of Fshb inhibitory and stimulatory factors (e.g. inhibin α, VGF), 2) activation of a signaling component with a refractory period (e.g. G protein), and 3) inactivation of a factor needed for Fshb induction (e.g. GDF9). Simulations with all three models recapitulated the Fshb expression levels obtained in standard perifusion experiments at different GnRH pulse frequencies. Notably, simulations altering average concentration, pulse duration and frequency showed that the apparent frequency-dependent pattern of Fshb expression obtained with model 1 actually resulted from variations in average GnRH concentration. In contrast, models 2 and 3 showed “true” frequency sensing. To resolve which components of this GnRH signal induce Fshb, a massively parallel experimental system was developed. Analysis of over 4000 samples in ~40 experiments indicated that, while early genes Egr1 and Fos respond only to variations in GnRH concentration, Fshb induction is sensitive to GnRH pulse frequency changes, whilst maintaining the same average concentration. These results provide a framework for understanding the role of different regulatory factors in modulating the responses of the Fshb gene.

Coverslips were placed in inert coverslip racks and pulse patterns were achieved by moving racks among GnRH, wash and resting solutions in chambers maintained at 37°C in a water bath. The chamber solution in the water bath was DMEM supplemented with 2% charcoal-treated FBS and 20mM HEPES. For each condition/time point, a minimum of 3 biological replicates were collected. Cells were pulsed with a cycle period (T) of either 30 min, 1 h,  2 h or 4 h, a pulse duration of either 2.5 min, 5 min, or 10 min, and a pulse amplitude of either 0.5 nM, 1 nM, or 2 nM GnRH.

Using genome-wide methylation analysis of SAE DNA of nonsmokers and smokers, the data identified 204 unique genes differentially methylated in SAE DNA of smokers compared with nonsmokers, with 67% of the regions with differential methylation occurring within 2 kb of the transcriptional start site. Among the genes with differential methylation were those related to metabolism, transcription, signal transduction and transport. For the differentially methylated genes, 35 exhibited a correlation with gene expression, 54% with an inverse correlation of DNA methylation with gene expression and 46% a direct correlation. These observations provide evidence that cigarette smoking alters the DNA methylation patterning of the SAE and that, for some genes, these changes are associated with the smoking-related changes in gene expression.","['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelium/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Respiratory Mucosa/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Young Adult']","['Experimental design and studies', 'Quality control report', 'Sequencing quality control', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetic mapping', 'Epitope mapping', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'Genome map', 'GWAS study', 'Rate of association', 'Genome annotation', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Translation initiation site prediction', 'Transcription', 'Gene transcription']"

As a counterdefense, viruses deploy viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). Well-established in plants and invertebrates, the existence of antiviral RNAi remains unknown in mammals. Here, we show that undifferentiated mouse cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or Nodamura virus (NoV) accumulate ~22-nucleotide RNAs with all the signature features of siRNAs. These derive from viral dsRNA replication intermediates, incorporate into AGO2, are eliminated in Dicer knockout cells, and decrease in abundance upon cell differentiation. Furthermore, genetically ablating a NoV-encoded VSR that antagonizes DICER during authentic infections reduces NoV accumulation, which is rescued in RNAi-deficient mouse cells.

While it is clear that age is a significant risk factor, markers of immune status associated with susceptibility to severe infections are incompletely defined. We have taken advantage of stable characteristics of individual status to profile immune markers from a stratified cohort of healthy subjects with a history of asymptomatic or severe infection with WNV. We characterized individual variations in antibody and serum cytokine levels and genome-wide transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood cells (PBMCs). While antibody levels were not significantly different between cohorts, we found that subjects with a history of severe infection had significantly lower levels of serum IL-4, and that these changes in IL-4 levels were associated with altered gene expression patterns in PBMCs. In addition, we identified a signature of 105 genes that displayed altered expression levels when comparing subjects with a history of asymptomatic or severe infection. These results suggest that systems-level analysis of immune system status can be used to identify factors relevant for susceptibility to severe infections, and specifically point to an important contribution for IL-4 in resistance to WNV infection.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', '*Biomarkers', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytokines/blood', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transcriptome', 'United States', 'West Nile Fever/*immunology', 'West Nile virus/*immunology', 'Young Adult']","['MGED', 'MGED concept ID', 'HPA antibody id', 'Epitope mapping', 'Biomarkers', 'BIOM format', 'Genetic marker identification', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Cytometry', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytogenetic map', 'Pathology', 'Disease ID', 'Disease name', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'MAT', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transcriptome assembly', 'UNITE accession', 'Phylogenetic discrete data', 'Phylip discrete states format', 'Exome sequencing', 'Virus identifier', 'Virus annotation']"
23408836,Cancer-produced metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase induce tumor-evoked Bregs via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha,"Breast cancer cells facilitate distant metastasis through the induction of immunosuppressive regulatory B cells, designated tBregs. We report in this study that, to do this, breast cancer cells produce metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway such as leukotriene B4 to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in B cells. Inactivation of leukotriene B4 signaling or genetic deficiency of PPARα in B cells blocks the generation of tBregs and thereby abrogates lung metastasis in mice with established breast cancer. Thus, in addition to eliciting fatty acid oxidation and metabolic signals, PPARα initiates programs required for differentiation of tBregs. We propose that PPARα in B cells and/or tumor 5-lipoxygenase pathways represents new targets for pharmacological control of tBreg-mediated cancer escape.","['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Lipoxygenase/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'PPAR alpha/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Escape/genetics/immunology']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Feature selection', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Tumor annotation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Cell and tissue culture', 'cel', 'Experimental data', 'Medicine', 'Experimental design and studies', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Strain name', 'Strain data format', 'Strain accession', 'Epistasis', 'Alpha diversity data', 'C-alpha trace', 'Structure alignment (protein C-alpha atoms)']"
23852169,"Reconstructing de novo silencing of an active plant retrotransposon: dynamics, mechanisms, biological implications","Transposable elements (TEs) contribute to genome size, organization and evolution. In plants, their activity is primarily controlled by transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), usually investigated at steady states, reflecting how long-established silent conditions are maintained, faithfully reiterated or temporarily modified. How active, invasive TEs are detected and silenced de novo in plants remains largely unknown. Using inbred lineages of hybrid Arabidopsis thaliana epigenomes combining wild-type and mutant chromosomes, we have deciphered the sequence of physiological and molecular events underlying the de novo invasion, proliferation and eventual demise of the single-copy endogenous retrotransposon Evadé (EVD). We show how this reconstructed TE burst causes widespread genome diversification and de novo epiallelism that could serve as sources for selectable and potentially adaptive traits.","['Arabidopsis/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Order', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genome, Plant', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Plants/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic']","['Arabidopsis', 'Locus ID (AGI)', 'Gene name (Arabidopsis)', 'DNA methylation', 'Methylation calling', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Epistasis', 'Gene ID', 'Codon usage', 'Codon usage table generation', 'Regular expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene order', 'Hit sort order', 'Aligned sequence order', 'Sequencing', 'Whole genome sequencing', 'RNA-Seq', 'Plant biology', 'Genome map', 'Genome alignment', 'Protein interactions', 'Pathogens', 'Protein interaction ID', 'Mathematical model', 'Biological model ID', 'Biological model format', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein domains', 'Phenotype name', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'KEGG PLANT entry format', 'Plant ontology term', 'Format detection', 'Protein identification', 'Citation', 'RNA', 'rna', 'RNA sequence', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'SECIS element prediction', 'Repeat sequences', 'Sequence', 'Repeat sequence analysis', 'Gene transcription', 'Transcription', 'DNA transcription']"

In this report, we first demonstrated that sphere cells from ovarian cancer cell line A2780 shared many features of CSCs, such as resistance to cisplatin and able to initiate tumors in an efficient manner. Then, we conducted cDNA microarray analysis on spheres from ovarian A2780 cells, and from breast MCF7 and SUM159 cells, and found that molecular pathways underlying spheres from these cancer cell lines were similar to a large extent, suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved in the genesis of CSCs in both ovarian and breast cancer types. In addition, we showed that spheres from these cancer types were highly sensitive to fenretinide, a stimulus of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, our results not only provide important insights into mechanisms underlying CSCs in ovarian and breast cancer, but also lead to the development of more sophisticated protocols of cancer therapy in near future.","['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/*administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/drug effects']","['BEAST', 'Yeast', 'Cell type accession', 'Cell biology', 'Cell line name', 'Drug report', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Gene expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Regular expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Human disease', 'cel', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Sequence analysis', 'Nucleic acid sequence', 'Protein variants', 'Variant calling', 'Genetic variation analysis', 'Cellular process pathways', 'Cellular process pathways report', 'Subcellular localisation prediction']"
23560115,Expression data from mouse insulinoma cells,"Elucidating the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic islet β cells is important for understanding and treating diabetes. MIN6 cells, a transformed β-cell line derived from a mouse insulinoma, retain GSIS and are a popular in vitro model for insulin secretion. However, in long-term culture, MIN6 cells' GSIS capacity is lost. We previously isolated a subclone, MIN6 clone 4, from the parental MIN6 cells, that shows well-regulated insulin secretion in response to glucose, glybenclamide, and KCl, even after prolonged culture. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for preserving GSIS in this subclone, we compared four groups of MIN6 cells: Pr-LP (parental MIN6, low passage number), Pr-HP (parental MIN6, high passage number), C4-LP (MIN6 clone 4, low passage number), and C4-HP (MIN6 clone 4, high passage number). Based on their capacity for GSIS, we designated the Pr-LP, C4-LP, and C4-HP cells as ""responder cells."" In a DNA microarray analysis, we identified a group of genes with high expression in responder cells (""responder genes""), but extremely low expression in the Pr-HP cells. Another group of genes (""non-responder genes"") was expressed at high levels in the Pr-HP cells, but at extremely low levels in the responder cells. Some of the responder genes were involved in secretory machinery or glucose metabolism, including Chrebp, Scgn, and Syt7. Among the non-responder genes were Car2, Maf, and Gcg, which are not normally expressed in islet β cells. Interestingly, we found a disproportionate number of known imprinted genes among the responder genes. Our findings suggest that the global expression profiling of GSIS-competent and GSIS-incompetent MIN6 cells will help delineate the gene regulatory networks for insulin secretion.","['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Carbonic Anhydrase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Glucose/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proglucagon/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-maf/genetics/metabolism', 'Secretagogins', 'Synaptotagmins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Protein binding sites', 'Binding site prediction', 'Protein-protein binding site prediction', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carbohydrate property', 'Carbohydrate report', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Generation', 'Cell migration analysis', 'Operation', 'Clone ID', 'Clone library', 'Clone ID (IMAGE)', 'Gene expression', 'Regular expression', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene regulatory networks', 'Gene regulatory network report', 'Gene regulatory network prediction', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Splice sites', 'Microarray raw data analysis', 'Analysis', 'Raw microarray data format', 'Proteins', 'protein', 'Protein-protein interactions', 'siRNA binding specificity prediction', 'Species name', 'DNA sense specification', 'Protein data', 'Transcription']"
23913270,Induction of the mouse germ cell fate by transcription factors in vitro [exp1],"The germ-cell lineage ensures the continuity of life through the generation of male and female gametes, which unite to form a totipotent zygote. We have previously demonstrated that, by using cytokines, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then into primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells with the capacity for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis, creating an opportunity for understanding and regulating mammalian germ-cell development in both sexes in vitro. Here we show that, without cytokines, simultaneous overexpression of three transcription factors, Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2γ), directs EpiLCs, but not embryonic stem cells, swiftly and efficiently into a PGC state. Notably, Prdm14 alone, but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c, suffices for the induction of the PGC state in EpiLCs. The transcription-factor-induced PGC state, irrespective of the transcription factors used, reconstitutes key transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that accompanies PGC or PGC-like-cell specification by cytokines including bone morphogenetic protein 4. Notably, the transcription-factor-induced PGC-like cells contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Our findings provide a new insight into the transcriptional logic for PGC specification, and create a foundation for the transcription-factor-based reconstitution and regulation of mammalian gametogenesis.","['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Cell Lineage/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Germ Layers/cytology', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Transcription Factor AP-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']","['Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Differential gene expression profiling', 'Differential gene expression analysis', 'Differential protein expression profiling', 'Cell line name', 'Cell line report', 'Cell line name (exact)', 'Proteins', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA binding sites', 'Embryology', 'Embryo report', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetic map', 'Genetics', 'Data handling', 'Protein solubility', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Gene expression profile', 'Gene expression profile processing', 'Keyword', 'cel', 'CellML', 'MAT', 'MeSH', 'Mice or rats', 'Rice', 'Gene transcription', 'Annotation track', 'Regulatory RNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Transcription factor binding sites', 'RNA-binding protein prediction', 'Transcription factor name', 'Transcription factor accession', 'Transcription factor identifier', 'Transcription']"
28546545,"The human growth hormone (hGH) minigene used for transgene stabilization in mice has been recently identified to be locally expressed in the tissues where transgenes are active and associated with phenotypic alterations. Here we extend these findings by analyzing the effect of the hGH minigene in TgC6hp55 transgenic mice which express the human TNFR1 under the control of the mesenchymal cell-specific CollagenVI promoter. These mice displayed a fully penetrant phenotype characterized by growth enhancement accompanied by perturbations in metabolic, skeletal, histological and other physiological parameters. Notably, this phenotype was independent of TNF-TNFR1 signaling since the genetic ablation of either Tnf or Tradd did not rescue the phenotype. Further analyses showed that the hGH minigene was expressed in several   tissues, also leading to increased hGH protein levels in the serum.

30270042,"Intestinal health is sustained by cooperation between diverse cell types, including epithelial cells, immune cells and stromal cells. Colonic stromal cells provide critical structural support but also regulate mucosal immunity, tolerance and inflammatory responses. Although mucosal stromal cells display substantial variability and plasticity, a paucity of unique genetic markers has precluded the identification of distinct stromal populations and functions. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing to uncover heterogeneity and subtype-specific markers of individual colonic stromal cells in health and ulcerative colitis (UC). Marker-free transcriptional clustering revealed four distinct stromal populations in healthy colon, corresponding to myofibroblasts and three previously unknown distinct subsets of fibroblasts. These fibroblast subsets were substantially remodeled in UC compared to healthy colon: inflamed UC colon was depleted for a healthy fibroblast subpopulation associated with epithelial cell homeostasis, and enriched for a novel disease-associated subtype expressing pro-inflammatory genes. Thus, we have discovered new, molecularly distinct colonic stromal cell subtypes that are altered in human disease.
Colonic epithelial cells from 3 healthy donors. 92 single cell libraries, 3 bulk controls, 1 empty well control. Individual donors processed as separate batches on Fluidigm C1 IFCs and pooled for sequencing (1 x Illumina HiSeq 2500 lane).","Intestinal mesenchymal cells play essential roles in epithelial homeostasis, matrix remodeling, immunity, and inflammation. But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo.

S. cerevisiae is found in multiple environments-one of which is the human body-as an opportunistic pathogen. To aid in the understanding of the S. cerevisiae population and quantitative genetics, as well as its emergence as an opportunistic pathogen, we sequenced, de novo assembled, and extensively manually edited and annotated the genomes of 93 S. cerevisiae strains from multiple geographic and environmental origins, including many clinical origin strains. These 93 S. cerevisiae strains, the genomes of which are near-reference quality, together with seven previously sequenced strains, constitute a novel genetic resource, the ""100-genomes"" strains. Our sequencing coverage, high-quality assemblies, and annotation provide unprecedented opportunities for detailed interrogation of complex genomic loci, examples of which we demonstrate. We found most phenotypic variation to be quantitative and identified population, genotype, and phenotype associations. Importantly, we identified clinical origin associations. For example, we found that an introgressed PDR5 was present exclusively in clinical origin mosaic group strains; that the mosaic group was significantly enriched for clinical origin strains; and that clinical origin strains were much more copper resistant, suggesting that copper resistance contributes to fitness in the human host. The 100-genomes strains are a novel, multipurpose resource to advance the study of S. cerevisiae population genetics, quantitative genetics, and the emergence of an opportunistic pathogen.","['Contig Mapping/*methods', '*Genome, Fungal', '*Genotype', '*Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/classification/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Sequence Alignment/*methods', 'Virulence/genetics']","['Mapping', 'ID mapping', 'Genome map', 'Genome report', 'Annotation track', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genotype and phenotype data', 'Genotype and phenotype annotation ID', 'Phenotype name', 'Phylogenetic tree', 'Phylogeny', 'Phylogeny reconstruction', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Polymorphism detection', 'Polymorphism report format', 'Gene ID (GeneDB Schizosaccharomyces pombe)', 'Monosaccharide accession', 'Sequence alignment', 'Virulence prediction', 'Virus identifier']"
