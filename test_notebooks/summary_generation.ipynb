The final follow-up visit was on Dec 23, 2020\\n          <p />\\n          <b>Study Design:</b> Four-arm, single-blind, phase 2, randomised controlled trial with follow-up up to 28 days after receiving the first dose of the study drugs\\n          <p />\\n          <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> Before the commencement of screening, our study team of clinicians and technicians met with community leaders, village health workers, and heads of households from each village to explain the study and obtain approval to conduct the study. Village health workers then used a door-to-door approach to inform households of the date and location where consenting and screening would take place. Participants were included in the trial if they met the following criteria: positive for <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocytes by microscopy (ie, ≥1 gametocytes recorded in a thick film against 500 white blood cells, equating to 16 gametocytes per μL with a standard conversion of 8000 white blood cells per μL blood); absence of other non-P falciparum species on blood film; haemoglobin density of 10 g/dL or more; normal G6PD (male >4 IU/g haemoglobin, female >6 IU/g haemoglobin); aged between 12–50 years; bodyweight 80 kg or less; no clinical signs of malaria defined by fever (≥37·5°C); no signs of acute, severe, or chronic disease; no allergies to any study drugs; reported no use of antimalarial drugs over the past week; consistent with the long half-life of tafenoquine, use of effective contraception for five half-lives (3 months) after the end of tafenoquine treatment. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy (tested at enrolment by urine and serum test) or lactation, use of other medication (except for paracetamol or aspirin), family history of congenital prolongation of the corrected QT interval, current or recent treatment with drugs known to extend the corrected QT interval, and blood transfusion in the past 90 days.\\n          <p />\\n          <b>Data Collection:</b> Participants received a full clinical and parasitological examination on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after receiving the first dose of the study drugs. Additional venous blood samples were taken for biochemical and infectivity assessments on days 0, 2, 7, and 14 in all treatment groups. For each assessment of infectivity, approximately 75 locally reared Anopheles gambiae were allowed to feed for 15–20 min on venous blood samples through a prewarmed glass membrane feeder system. All surviving mosquitoes were dissected on the seventh day after the feeding assay; midguts were stained in 1% mercurochrome and examined for the presence and density of oocysts by expert microscopists.\\n          <p />\\n      </blockquote>\\n      <p />\\n      <b>ClinEpiDB Data Integration:</b> Data files were provided to ClinEpiDB as excel files.

Uganda was the first country to implement universal distribution of free long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) starting in 2014, with repeated campaigns every 3-4 years. Uganda \\n      also has one of the largest indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) programs, focusing on selected high transmission districts using different formulations of insecticides rotated every few years. \\n      <p />\\n      The success of this intensive approach to vector control has been well documented in Tororo District, a historically high transmission area of southeastern Uganda. IRS was first implemented in Tororo \\n      District in December 2014, initially using a carbamate (Bendiocarb), then switching to an organophosphate (Actellic) in 2016. Comparing key malaria indicators measured from 2011-2014 (prior to IRS) \\n      with indicators in 2017-2019 (after two rounds of universal LLIN distribution and 5 years of sustained IRS), a 500-fold decrease in malaria transmission intensity, a 60-fold decrease in \\n      the incidence of symptomatic malaria, and a 5-fold decrease in parasite prevalence among children 0.5 to 10 years of age were documented. In addition, over this time frame there was a marked shift in the predominant \\n      vector species from <i>An. gambiae s.s.</i> to <i>An. arabiensis</i>. \\n      <p />\\n      However, a marked resurgence of malaria cases in 2020 was documented using health facility-based data from 5 districts of Uganda (including Tororo), reaching pre-IRS levels within 1-2 years. \\n      This coincided with a change to clothianidin-based formulations of IRS (Fludora Fusion/SumiShield) in 2019-2020.\\n      <p />\\n      To quantify the magnitude of the resurgence, investigate causes, and evaluate the impact of a shift back to IRS with Actellic in 2023, the PRISM Border\\n      Cohort study assessed changes in malaria metrics in regions within and near Tororo District.\\n      <p />\\n      <b>Objectives:</b> To better quantify the magnitude of the malaria resurgence in Tororo and to investigate potential causes, the PRISM Border Cohort compared temporal changes in malaria incidence, \\n      prevalence, and entomological measures between September 2020 and September 2023 in a cohort of 667 residents living in two areas within Tororo District and in neighboring Busia District, \\n      where IRS has never been implemented. In addition, the study assessed changes after the formulation of IRS in Tororo District was shifted back to an organophosphate (Actellic) in March 2023. \\n      <p />\\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\\n      <blockquote>\\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> Tororo and Busia Districts, Uganda\\n      <p />\\n      <img width=\"800px\" src=\"/documents/icemr_prism2_border_cohort/MAP_cross sectional survey households.png\" />\\n      <p />\\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> August 2020 – September 2023\\n      <p />\\n      <b>Study Design:</b> Prospective cohort study\\n      <p />\\n      <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> \\n      <p />\\n      Households were randomly selected from an enumeration list for screening and enrolled if they met the following criteria: \\n      <blockquote>\\n      <ul>\\n        <li>At least two members aged 5 years or younger reside in the household</li>\\n        <li>No more than 7 permanent residents currently reside in the household</li>\\n        <li>The household has no plans to move from the study catchment area in the next 2 years</li>\\n        <li>The household expressed willingness to participate in entomological surveillance studies</li>\\n      </ul>\\n      </blockquote>\\n      <p />\\n      All permanent residents from enrolled households were screened and enrolled in the cohort study if they met the following criteria: \\n      <blockquote>\\n      <ul>\\n        <li>The selected household was considered their primary residence</li>\\n        <li>The resident agreed to come to the study clinic for any febrile illness and scheduled routine visits</li>\\n        <li>The resident agreed to avoid antimalarial medications outside the study</li>\\n        <li>The resident (for parent or guardian in the case of children) provided written informed consent</li>\\n      </ul>\\n      </blockquote>\\n      <p />\\n      <b>Data Collection:</b> \\n      At enrollment, a baseline evaluation was conducted including a detailed medical history, focused physical examination, and blood collection by venipuncture for hemoglobin measurement, \\n      thick blood smear, and storage for future molecular studies. A household survey was conducted to collect information on characteristics of the household and LLIN ownership; all household \\n      members were provided access to an LLIN after the survey. A wealth index was generated for each household using principal components analysis based on common assets and categorized into tertiles. \\n      <p />\\n      The cohort was dynamic, such that over the course of the study any permanent residents that joined a household were screened for enrollment.

      "The PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort aims to investigate the resurgence of malaria in Tororo District, Uganda, following previous interventions with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The study enrolled 667 residents and compared malaria incidence and prevalence between September 2020 and September 2023. Factors such as the impact of the shift back to organophosphate IRS (Actellic) in March 2023 were also evaluated. Initial data highlighted significant decreases in malaria metrics from prior interventions, but a resurgence was noted in 2020. This cohort study sheds light on the complex dynamics of malaria transmission and vector control efficacy in high-burden areas. The PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort is a dynamic prospective cohort study conducted in Tororo and Busia Districts, Uganda, from August 2020 to September 2023. Eligibility criteria included households with at least two members under five years of age, and participants underwent regular medical evaluations, blood collections, and mosquito trapping every two weeks to assess malaria metrics and entomological factors.\n",

      "The PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort aims to investigate the resurgence of malaria in Tororo District, Uganda, following previous interventions with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The study enrolled 667 residents and compared malaria incidence and prevalence between September 2020 and September 2023. Factors such as the impact of the shift back to organophosphate IRS (Actellic) in March 2023 were also evaluated. Initial data highlighted significant decreases in malaria metrics from prior interventions, but a resurgence was noted in 2020. This cohort study sheds light on the complex dynamics of malaria transmission and vector control efficacy in high-burden areas. The PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort is a dynamic prospective cohort study conducted in Tororo and Busia Districts, Uganda, from August 2020 to September 2023. Eligibility criteria included households with at least two members under five years of age, and participants underwent regular medical evaluations, blood collections, and mosquito trapping every two weeks to assess malaria metrics and entomological factors.\n"
