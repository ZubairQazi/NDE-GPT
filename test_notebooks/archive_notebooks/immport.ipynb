       "'<p>Host responses to vaccines are complex but important to investigate. To facilitate the study, we have developed a tool called Vaccine Induced Gene Expression Analysis Tool (VIGET), with the aim to provide an interactive online tool for users to efficiently and robustly analyze the host immune response gene expression data collected in the ImmPort database. VIGET allows users to select vaccines, choose ImmPort studies, set up analysis models by choosing confounding variables and two groups of samples having different vaccination times, and then perform differential expression analysis to select genes for pathway enrichment analysis and functional interaction network construction using the Reactome&rsquo;s web services. VIGET provides features for users to compare results from two analyses, facilitating comparative response analysis across different demographic groups. VIGET uses the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to classify various types of vaccines such as live or inactivated flu vaccines, yellow fever vaccines, etc. Different variables are classified using our Vaccine Investigation Ontology (VIO). To showcase the utilities of VIGET, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of immune responses to yellow fever vaccines and found an intriguing complex activity response pattern of pathways in the immune system annotated in Reactome, demonstrating that VIGET is a valuable web portal that supports effective vaccine response studies using Reactome pathways and ImmPort data. The portal has been deployed at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viget.violinet.org/\">https://viget.violinet.org/</a>.</p>'"

To facilitate the study, we have developed a tool called Vaccine Induced Gene Expression Analysis Tool (VIGET), with the aim to provide an interactive online tool for users to efficiently and robustly analyze the host immune response gene expression data collected in the ImmPort database. VIGET allows users to select vaccines, choose ImmPort studies, set up analysis models by choosing confounding variables and two groups of samples having different vaccination times, and then perform differential expression analysis to select genes for pathway enrichment analysis and functional interaction network construction using the Reactome&rsquo;s web services. VIGET provides features for users to compare results from two analyses, facilitating comparative response analysis across different demographic groups. VIGET uses the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to classify various types of vaccines such as live or inactivated flu vaccines, yellow fever vaccines, etc. Different variables are classified using our Vaccine Investigation Ontology (VIO). To showcase the utilities of VIGET, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of immune responses to yellow fever vaccines and found an intriguing complex activity response pattern of pathways in the immune system annotated in Reactome, demonstrating that VIGET is a valuable web portal that supports effective vaccine response studies using Reactome pathways and ImmPort data. The portal has been deployed at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viget.violinet.org/\">https://viget.violinet.org/</a>.</p>',\n",

We further show that this approach extends survival of mice lethally infected with SARS-CoV-2, correlating with decreased lung virus burden, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and diminished severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Postinfection treatment by this nanosystem dramatically lowers the lung virus burden and alleviates virus-induced pathological changes.

Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory signature, including high levels of inflammatory cytokines, alveolar inflammatory infiltrates and vascular microthrombi. Here we show that patients with severe COVID-19 produced a unique serologic signature, including an increased likelihood of IgG1 with afucosylated Fc glycans. This Fc modification on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgGs enhanced interactions with the activating Fc-Gamma receptor Fc-Gamma RIIIa; when incorporated into immune complexes, Fc afucosylation enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. These results show that disease severity in COVID-19 correlates with the presence of proinflammatory IgG Fc structures, including afucosylated IgG1.',\n",

Notably, BA.2.75 exhibits enhanced neutralization resistance over BA.2 but less than the BA.4/5 variant. The G446S and N460K mutations of BA.2.75 are primarily responsible for its enhanced resistance to neutralizing antibodies. The R493Q mutation, a reversion to the prototype sequence, reduces BA.2.75 neutralization resistance. The impact of these mutations is consistent with their locations in common neutralizing antibody epitopes. Further, BA.2.75 shows enhanced cell-cell fusion over BA.2, driven largely by the N460K mutation, which enhances S processing. Structural modeling reveals enhanced receptor contacts introduced by N460K, suggesting a mechanism of potentiated receptor utilization and syncytia formation.',\n",

We used flow cytometry, T cell receptor analysis, single-cell transcriptomics, and cytokine analysis to profile virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing ubiquitous pathogens influenza and cytomegalovirus. Our results reveal that virus specificity determines overall magnitude, tissue distribution, differentiation, and clonal repertoire of virus-specific T cells. Age and sex influence T cell differentiation and dissemination in tissues, while T cell tissue residence and functionality is highly correlated with the site. Together, our results demonstrate how the covariates of virus, tissue, age, and sex impact the anti-viral immune response, important for targeting, monitoring, and predicting immune responses to existing and emerging viruses.',\n",

Contrary to the established role of CD69 on CD8 T cells, the functions of CD103 and CD49a on this population are not well defined. This study examines the expression patterns and functions of CD103 and CD49a with a specific focus on their impact on T cell motility during influenza virus infection. We show that the TRM cell surface phenotype develops by two-weeks post-infection and that each integrin contributes a distinct function regulating CD8 T cell motility both in vitro and in vivo, with CD49a facilitating migration and CD103 limiting motility through tethering. These results demonstrate for the first time how CD103 and CD49a differentially impact adherence and migration in the tissue, likely affecting overall retention, maintenance of TRM, and host protection.',\n",

Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of wild-type and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccine rollout and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We show that variants with enhanced transmissibility frequently increase epidemic severity, whereas those with partial immune escape either fail to spread widely or primarily cause reinfections and breakthrough infections. However, when these phenotypes are combined, a variant can continue spreading even as immunity builds up in the population, limiting the impact of vaccination and exacerbating the epidemic. These findings help explain the trajectories of past and present SARS-CoV-2 variants and may inform variant assessment and response in the future.',\n",

Here, we demonstrated that liposomal nanoparticles bearing an allergen and a high-affinity glycan ligand of the inhibitory receptor CD33 profoundly suppressed IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, prevented anaphylaxis in Tg mice with mast cells expressing human CD33, and desensitized mice to subsequent allergen challenge for several days. We showed that high levels of CD33 were consistently expressed on human skin mast cells and that the antigenic liposomes with CD33 ligand prevented IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction in slices of human lung. The results demonstrated the potential of exploiting CD33 to desensitize mast cells to provide a therapeutic window for administering allergen immunotherapy without triggering anaphylaxis.',\n",

The frequency of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells was significantly increased in patients at risk of developing plasma leakage. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that CD4+CD8+ DP cells co-clustered with CD8+ SP cells, and showed a similar expression profile in patients with and without warning signs of plasma leakage, implying a role of CD4+CD8+ DP cells in plasma leakage through a quantitative increase rather than functional alteration.',\n",
       "  'Mutations in the FUT2 gene that result in a lack of expression of histo-blood group antigens on secreted glycoproteins may shape the vaginal microbiota with consequences for birth outcome. To test this, we analysed the relationship between secretor status, vaginal microbiota and gestational length in an ethnically diverse cohort of 313 pregnant women, including 91 who delivered prematurely. Lactobacillus species were found to co-occur less often with other microbial taxa in non-secretors. Moreover, non-secretors with Lactobacillus spp. depleted vaginal microbiota in early pregnancy had significantly shorter gestational length than Lactobacillus spp. dominated non-secretors (mean of 245.5 (SD=44.5) versus 265.9 (23.6)); p=0.045), but not compared to Lactobacillus spp. dominated (261.8 (27.5)) and depleted (264.3 days (21.2)) secretors. In identifying a relationship between blood-group antigen expression and vaginal microbiota-host interactions, our results point towards stratification by secretor status as an important factor for considering preterm birth risk and prevention.',\n",
       "  'The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, including in highly vaccinated populations, has raised important questions about the efficacy of current vaccines. In this study, we show that the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine and the adenovirus-vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine provide robust protection against high-dose challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in cynomolgus macaques. We vaccinated 30 macaques with homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S. Following Omicron challenge, vaccinated macaques demonstrated rapid control of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage, and most vaccinated animals also controlled virus in nasal swabs. However, 4 vaccinated animals that had moderate Omicron-neutralizing antibody titers and undetectable Omicron CD8+ T cell responses failed to control virus in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover, virologic control correlated with both antibody and T cell responses. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to vaccine protection against a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant.',\n",

The mechanisms by which circulating ASCs become LLPCs are not well elucidated. Here, we show that human blood ASCs have distinct morphology, transcriptomes, and epigenetics compared with BM LLPCs. Compared with blood ASCs, BM LLPCs have decreased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio but increased endoplasmic reticulum and numbers of mitochondria. LLPCs up-regulate pro-survival genes MCL1, BCL2, and BCL-XL while simultaneously down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes HRK1, CASP3, and CASP8 Consistent with reduced gene expression, the pro-apoptotic gene loci are less accessible in LLPCs. Of the pro-survival genes, only BCL2 is concordant in gene up-regulation and loci accessibility. Using a novel in vitro human BM mimetic, we show that blood ASCs undergo similar morphological and molecular changes that resemble ex vivo BM LLPCs. Overall, our study demonstrates that early-minted blood ASCs in the BM microniche must undergo morphological, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes to mature into apoptotic-resistant LLPCs.',\n",

Seroprevalence ranged around 28% early during the pandemic and a good correlation was observed between RBD and spike-based ELISAs. Modest correlations were observed between NP and both RBD and spike-based assays. The antibody levels in HCWs declined over time; however, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD and spike-based assays remained unchanged, while the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined.

Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen and lungs, exhibiting shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity prevail in lymph nodes and intestines, exhibiting tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations.

However, the importance of humoral and cellular immunity for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined. Here we show that adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects naive recipient rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.

Cervical shortening, which often precedes preterm birth, is associated with Lactobacillus iners and elevated levels of IgM, C3b, C5, C5a and IL-6.

Here, we obtained tissues from human organ donors to examine T cells across major barrier sites (skin, lung, jejunum), associated lymph nodes, lymphoid organs (spleen, bone marrow), and in circulation. By integrating single-cell protein and transcriptome profiling, we demonstrate that human barrier sites contain tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that exhibit site-adapted profiles for residency, homing, and function distinct from circulating memory T cells. Incorporating T cell receptor and transcriptome analysis, we show that circulating memory T cells are highly expanded, display extensive overlap between sites, and exhibit effector and cytolytic functional profiles, while TRM clones exhibit site-specific expansions and distinct functional capacities. Together, our findings indicate that circulating T cells are more disseminated and differentiated, while TRM exhibit tissue-specific adaptation and clonal segregation, suggesting that strategies to promote barrier immunity require tissue-targeting.',\n",

Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here, we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods: Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings: Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4%-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10%-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions: These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection, but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease, compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response.

The result shows that PGR evolved rapidly in the human lineage (as well as other Catarrhine primates), which likely reflects an episode of relaxed selection intensity rather than positive selection. Coincident with the episode of relaxed selection intensity, ancestral sequence resurrection and functional tests indicate that the major human PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) evolved divergent functions in the human stem-lineage.

We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10 challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice.',\n",

We performed a longitudinal analysis of pre-COVID19-pandemic samples from 2016-2019 in young adults and assessed CCC-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses. Notably, CCC responses were commonly detected with comparable frequencies as with other common antigens and were sustained over time. CCC-specific CD4+ T cell responses were associated with low HLA-DR+CD38+ signals, and their magnitude did not correlate with yearly CCC infection prevalence. Similarly, CCC-specific and spike RBD-specific IgG responses were stable in time. Finally, high CCC-specific CD4+ T cell reactivity, but not antibody titers, was associated with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These results provide a valuable reference for understanding the immune response to endemic coronaviruses and suggest that steady and sustained CCC responses are likely from a stable pool of memory CD4+ T cells due to repeated earlier exposures and possibly occasional reinfections.',\n",

The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October-8 December), while the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans prior to November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported.

Here, we provide a framework to address this question through a joint Bayesian model that simultaneously analyzes lab validation and field survey data, and we define the impact of test allocation on inferences of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. In many scenarios, prevalence estimates can be most improved by apportioning additional effort towards validation rather than to the field.

To identify BMI-associated metabolic perturbations and potential mid-gestation serum biomarkers of sPTB, the study compared metabolomics/lipidomics in sPTB and FTB (Full term birth) women stratified by BMIs categories: underweight, normal weight, and obese. Technique: combining untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics with targeted metabolic profiling of major regulators of inflammation and metabolism, including oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids and ceramides. Results: 1) underweight/sPTB showed dyslipidemia characterized by elevated phospholipids, unsaturated triglycerides, sphingomyelins, cholesteryl esters and long-chain acylcarnitines. 2) normalweight/sPTB showed altered relative abundance of 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids to other regioisomers at mid-pregnancy. 3) obese/sPTB: showed elevated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia characterized by elevated serum free fatty acids. In conclusion, using metabolomics can distinct BMI-dependent metabolic manifestations among women who had sPTB',\n",

We carefully reviewed all clinical records to ascertain the provider's level of clinical suspicion for COVID-19 illness and compared these assessments with available results of SARS-CoV-2 testing, in addition to longitudinal data on clinical outcomes. We found that the vast majority of patients (96% of N = 25) clinically assessed to have a low probability of COVID-19 illness were subsequently confirmed to have either a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result or, in the absence of testing, clinical stability without any further concern for COVID-19 illness.

       "  'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide spectrum of disease presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity and the levels of circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, including virus-neutralizing titers. A serological analysis of 536 convalescent healthcare workers reveals that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels are elevated in individuals that experience severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody is dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), with an IgG subclass ratio skewed toward elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. In addition, individuals that experience severe disease show elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody binding to the inflammatory receptor Fc?RIIIa. Based on these correlational studies, we propose that spike-specific IgG subclass utilization may contribute to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results may have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and convalescent plasma therapy.',\n",
       "  'Establishing how many people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 remains an urgent priority for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.',\n",
       "  'Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as the birth of an infant before 37 weeks of gestational age. It is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 15 million preterm births per year. Vaginal microbiome more specifically is known to change throughout pregnancy, and can even affect the fetus before delivery. This study presents the first meta-analysis of vaginal microbiome in preterm birth. This study integrated raw 16S ribosomal RNA vaginal microbiome data from three pregnancy related studies consisting of over 300 pregnant patients sampled longitudinally over the three trimesters. It was found that women who later have a preterm delivery, have a higher variance in their vaginal microbiome, with the largest, most significant difference between term and preterm patients being in samples collected during the first trimester. While several of the microbial genera have been reported previously, three of those nine microbial genera are newly reported here. New hypotheses emerging from such an integrative analysis can lead to novel diagnostics to identify women who are at higher risk for PTB and potentially inform new therapeutic interventions.',\n",

Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated rapid protection following mRNA vaccination. Thus, we sought to investigate how quickly mRNA vaccines elicit antibody responses compared to other vaccine modalities. We first compared the immune kinetics of mRNA and DNA vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike in mice. We observed rapid induction of antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies by day 5 following mRNA (4??g/mouse), but not DNA (50??g/mouse), immunization. Comparing innate responses hours post immunization, the mRNA vaccine induced increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, and MCP-1 cytokines which maybe promoting humoral responses downstream. We then evaluated the immune kinetics of an HIV-1 mRNA vaccine in comparison to DNA, protein, and rhesus adenovirus 52 (RhAd52) vaccines of the same HIV-1 envelope antigen in mice. Again, induction of envelope-specific antibodies was observed by day 5 following mRNA vaccination, whereas antibodies were detected by day 7?14 following DNA, protein, and RhAd52 vaccination. Thus, eliciting rapid humoral immunity may be a unique and advantageous property of mRNA vaccines for controlling infectious disease outbreaks.',\n",

       "  'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective prophylactic vaccination to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry. The current intramuscular vaccines elicit systemic immunity but not necessarily high-level mucosal immunity. Here, we tested a single intranasal dose of our candidate adenovirus type 5-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (AdCOVID) in inbred, outbred, and transgenic mice. A single intranasal vaccination with AdCOVID elicited a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA in the respiratory tract, serum neutralizing antibodies, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. A single AdCOVID dose resulted in immunity that was sustained for over six months. Moreover, a single intranasal dose completely protected K18-hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, preventing weight loss and mortality. These data show that AdCOVID promotes concomitant systemic and mucosal immunity and represents a promising vaccine candidate.',\n",
       "  'During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, novel and traditional vaccine strategies have been deployed globally. We investigated whether antibodies stimulated by mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2), including third-dose boosting, differ from those generated by infection or adenoviral (ChAdOx1-S and Gam-COVID-Vac) or inactivated viral (BBIBP-CorV) vaccines. We analyzed human lymph nodes after infection or mRNA vaccination for correlates of serological differences. Antibody breadth against viral variants is lower after infection compared with all vaccines evaluated but improves over several months. Viral variant infection elicits variant-specific antibodies, but prior mRNA vaccination imprints serological responses toward Wuhan-Hu-1 rather than variant antigens. In contrast to disrupted germinal centers (GCs) in lymph nodes during infection, mRNA vaccination stimulates robust GCs containing vaccine mRNA and spike antigen up to 8 weeks postvaccination in some cases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity, breadth, and maturation are affected by imprinting from exposure history and distinct histological and antigenic contexts in infection compared with vaccination.',\n",

Children are not spared from infection nor complications of COVID-19, and the recent recommendation for boosters in individuals ages 12 years or older calls for broader understanding of the adolescent immune profile after mRNA vaccination. We tested the durability and cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses over a six-month time course in vaccinated adolescents against the SARS-CoV-2 D614G (\"\"wild type\"\") and Omicron antigens. Serum from 77 adolescents showed that anti-Spike antibodies wane significantly over six months. After completion of a two-vaccine series, cross-reactivity against Omicron-specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) was seen. Functional humoral activation against wild type and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 also declines over time in vaccinated adolescent children. Evidence of waning mRNA-induced vaccine immunity underscores vulnerabilities in long-term pediatric protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while cross-reactivity highlights the additional benefits of vaccination. Characterization of adolescent immune signatures post-vaccination will inform guidance on vaccine platforms and timelines, and ultimately optimize immunoprotection of children.',\n",
       "  'Screening programs that test only the unvaccinated population have been proposed and implemented to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread, implicitly assuming that the unvaccinated population drives transmission. To evaluate this premise and quantify the impact of unvaccinated-only screening programs, we introduce a model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through which we explore a range of transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness scenarios, rates of prior infection, and screening programs. We find that, as vaccination rates increase, the proportion of transmission driven by the unvaccinated population decreases, such that most community spread is driven by vaccine-breakthrough infections once vaccine coverage exceeds 55% (omicron) or 80% (delta), points which shift lower as vaccine effectiveness wanes. Thus, we show that as vaccination rates increase, the transmission reductions associated with unvaccinated-only screening decline, identifying three distinct categories of impact on infections and hospitalizations. More broadly, these results demonstrate that effective unvaccinated-only screening depends on population immunity, vaccination rates, and variant.',\n",
       "  'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation that have a major impact on many diseases and provide an exciting avenue toward antiviral therapeutics. From patient transcriptomic data, we determined that a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, is directly involved with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) machinery during host infection. Specifically, we show that miR-2392 is key in driving downstream suppression of mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation, glycolysis, and hypoxia, as well as promoting many symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We demonstrate that miR-2392 is present in the blood and urine of patients positive for COVID-19 but is not present in patients negative for COVID-19. These findings indicate the potential for developing a minimally invasive COVID-19 detection method. Lastly, using in vitro human and in vivo hamster models, we design a miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic that targets miR-2392, significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 viability in hamsters, and may potentially inhibit a COVID-19 disease state in humans.',\n",
       "  'Substantial H5 influenza HA directed immunity is elicited after vaccination of human subjects who had been previously immunized with a drifted H5 HA variant. We sought to investigate the characteristics of H5 HA specific immune responses in more depth by developing an animal model of H5 HA vaccination using drift variants of recombinant H5 HA proteins. HA proteins derived from influenzas A/Vietnam/1203/04 (Clade 1) and A/Indonesia/05/05 (Clade 2.1) were chosen. The sequence of vaccination consisted of two doses of homologous protein, followed by one additional dose of the homologous or heterologous, drifted HA protein. Each dose of HA was combined with CpG as an adjuvant and was injected subcutaneously. All the animals exhibited a serum IgG antibody response that cross-reacted with both HAs in an ELISA. However, those animals that received the drifted variant exhibited higher reactivity to the heterologous HA. Competitive ELISA of serum from drift-variant recipients showed evidence of antibody focusing towards the drifted HA, suggesting modification of the response towards improved cross-reactivity, though development of neutralizing antibodies was limited. Nevertheless, animals were protected against live-virus challenge, and passive transfer of serum was sufficient to confer protection to otherwise naive mice, indicating that both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies offer some degree of protection. These findings suggest that pre-vaccination against H5 influenza has the potential to prime immunity against emerging drifted H5 strains, and could also lower the dose requirements of vaccination in the event of a pandemic.',\n",

       "  'Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that overcome natural and vaccine-induced immunity threaten to exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on the cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses. IMPORTANCE Widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. NAb responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virological, immunological, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",

In this study, AD subjects and controls will be vaccinated with the yellow fever virus (YFV) (YFV-17D) by the subcutaneous (SC) or TC route to determine: 1) whether there are quantitative differences in the antiviral immune responses elicited in these 2 distinct groups of subjects; and 2) whether the route of vaccination alters these immune responses, especially in AD subjects who may have altered cutaneous immunity. Using in-depth analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in AD subjects and controls, an immunological signature may be identified that would aid in the screening process of individuals who might be at risk for EV. Moreover, this study will provide substantial information about normal and defective cutaneous immunity in AD subjects, which will be critical for future development of therapeutic drugs aimed at preventing or alleviating EV, as well as other more common viral skin infections.

Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk change across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites.

In an effort to indentify benchmarks of immunological health, influenza vaccination was used in 10 young (20-30 years) and 19 older subjects (60 to 89 years) as models for strong and weak immune responses, respectively. Serological responses to influenza strains as well as a wide variety of other parameters, including gene expression, antibodies to hemagglutinin peptides, serum cytokines, cell subset phenotypes and in vitro cytokine stimulation were measured. Using machine learning, nine variables predicting antibody response with 84% accuracy were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance:Most events that occurred more than 2 years after donation were nonsurgical and could occur up to 40 years after donation. Findings support the construction of a national registry for long-term monitoring of LDs and confirm the value of secondary reanalysis of clinical studies.',\n",
       "  \"The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 to 5 months of three treatments ― omalizumab, corticosteroid therapy boost, and placebo ― in reducing fall exacerbations in inner-city children and adolescents with allergic persistent asthma when initiated approximately 4 -6 weeks prior to the start of the first day of each participant's school year.\",\n",

       "  'The placenta is metabolically active and supports the growth of the fetus. We hypothesize that deficits in the capacity of the placenta to maintain bioenergetic and metabolic stability during pregnancy may result in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). To explore this hypothesis, we performed a nested cased control study of metabolomic signatures in placentas from women with SPTB (<36 weeks gestation) compared to normal pregnancies (?38 weeks gestation). To control for the effects of gestational age on placenta metabolism, we also studied a subset of metabolites in non-laboring preterm and term Rhesus monkeys. Comprehensive quantification of metabolites demonstrated a significant elevation in the levels of amino acids, prostaglandins, sphingolipids, lysolipids, and acylcarnitines in SPTB placenta compared to term placenta. Additional quantification of placental acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the significant elevation in SPTB human, with no significant differences between midgestation and term placenta in Rhesus macaque. Fatty acid oxidation as measured by the flux of 3H-palmitate in SPTB placenta was lower than term. Collectively, significant and biologically relevant alterations in the placenta metabolome were identified in SPTB placenta. Altered acylcarnitine levels and fatty acid oxidation suggest that disruption in normal substrate metabolism is associated with SPTB.',\n",
       "  'Recent studies have shown that vaccinated individuals harbor T cells that can cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human common cold coronaviruses. However, it is still unknown whether CD4+ T cells from vaccinated individuals recognize peptides from bat coronaviruses that may have the potential of causing future pandemics. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitope (S815-827) that is conserved in coronaviruses from different genera and subgenera, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, multiple bat coronaviruses, and a feline coronavirus. Our results showed that S815-827 was recognized by 42% of vaccinated participants in our study who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines. Using T cell expansion and T cell receptor sequencing assays, we demonstrated that S815-827-reactive CD4+ T cells from the majority of responders cross-recognized homologous peptides from at least 6 other diverse coronaviruses. Our results support the hypothesis that the current mRNA vaccines elicit T cell responses that can cross-recognize bat coronaviruses and thus might induce some protection against potential zoonotic outbreaks. Furthermore, our data provide important insights that inform the development of T cell?based pan-coronavirus vaccine strategies.',\n",

A recent study conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated.
