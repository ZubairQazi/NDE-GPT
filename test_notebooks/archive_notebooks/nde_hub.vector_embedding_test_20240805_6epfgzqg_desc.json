During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.\n      <p />\n      Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence\n      also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can\n      have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.\n      <p />\n      The WASH Benefits studies provides rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,\n      sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled\n      trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Kenya. The study is large in scope\n      (> 7,000 newborns) and has eight arms (six treatment arms and two control arms). Primary outcomes were measured after\n      two years of intervention.     \n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of\n      sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of\n      life. The WASH Benefits Kenya study is highly comparable to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study; both cluster randomized\n      trials investigated the effects of the same six treatment arms.\n      <p />\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n      <p />\n      <li>The study has three <b>primary scientific objectives:</b>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and\n        development after 2 years of intervention.</li>\n        <li>Determine whether there are larger reductions in diarrhea when providing a combined water, sanitation and handwashing\n        intervention compared to each component alone.</li>\n        <li>Determine whether there are larger effects on growth and development from combining a) daily supplemental nutrition\n        with b) a combined water, sanitation and handwashing intervention compared to each component alone.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>The study has three <b>secondary scientific objectives:</b><i> (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)</i>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Measure the impact of nutritional supplements and household environmental interventions on environmental enteropathy\n        biomarkers, and more clearly elucidate this potential pathway between environmental interventions and child growth and development.</li>\n        <li>Measure the impact of sanitation, water quality, handwashing and nutritional interventions on intestinal parasitic infection\n        prevalence and intensity.</li>\n        <li>Measure the association between parasitic infection and other measures of enteric health, including acute diarrhea and environmental\n        enteropathy biomarkers.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>The <b>tertiary scientific objective</b> of the study was to measure the impact of interventions on the following outcomes:<i> (Data is not currently available on ClinEpiDB.org.)</i>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Weight-for-age at 1 and 2 years</li>\n        <li>Weight-for-height at 1 and 2 years</li>\n        <li>Underweight at 2 years</li>\n        <li>Wasting at 2 years</li>\n        <li>Severe stunting at 2 years</li>\n        <li>Head circumference-for-age at 1 year and 2 years</li>\n        <li>Soil-transmitted helminth infection at 2 years</li>\n        <li>Protozoan infection at 2 years</li>\n        <li>Verbal Communicative Development Inventory at 1 year</li>\n        <li>WHO motor milestones at 1 year</li>\n        <li>Acute respiratory illness</li>\n        <li>All cause mortality</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> The trial was conducted in rural areas of 10 districts in Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga counties in the western \n      part of Kenya. The region is populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Unimproved latrine coverage is high (at least 85%). A pilot study in the region\n      estimated that among children <27 months old, 11% had diarrhea in the preceding 2 days. Very few (<5%) households had piped water and the majority of households \n      reported obtaining drinking water from sources where chlorination has previously been shown to be effective (such as protected springs). \n      <p />\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> November 2012 - May 2014 \n      <p />\n      <b>Study Design:</b> Cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6 treatment arms, a passive control arm, and a double-sized active control arm. Pregnant women \n      were enrolled, and outcomes were assessed in the children following 12 and 24 months of intervention. \n      <p />\n      <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> The study communities must have met the following criteria:\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Rural communities (defined as villages with <25% of residents living in rental houses, <2 gas/petrol stations and <10 shops)</li>\n        <li>Not enrolled in ongoing water, sanitation, hygiene, or nutrition programs</li>\n        <li>Most of the population relied on communal water sources and had unimproved sanitation facilities</li>\n        <li>At least six eligible pregnant women in the cluster at baseline</li>\n      </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p />\n      <b>Study Arms:</b> Clusters were randomized to one of 8 study arms. Intervention delivery occurred within 3 months after enrollment of pregnant women, prior \n      to or as close to birth as possible. Compounds shared a latrine, so sanitation and handwashing interventions were delivered a the compound-level. Nutritional \n      interventions were delivered directly to the child participant within households.\n      <blockquote>\n      <ol>\n        <li><b> Water quality:</b> The study installed chlorine dispensers within the cluster boundary at public water sources used by study participants. \n        All community members were also able to use the dispensers. After filling their water collection container (typically a 20 L plastic jerry can) at the \n        source, users could place the container under the dispenser and turn a knob to release 3 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite, an amount designed to yield \n        2 mL/L of free chlorine residual after 30 min for 20 L of water. The study also included community level promotion of dispenser use and all households \n        in the study compound received bottles of sodium hypochlorite (6 months' supply) to facilitate householders' water treatment during periods when they \n        rely on rainwater harvesting (common during the rainy season) or if they use a water source in which a dispenser has not been installed. Households were \n        visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b>Sanitation:</b> The sanitation intervention included three hardware components: (1) All existing latrines in the compound were \n        upgraded by installing a plastic slab with a tight-fitting lid. Households without latrines or with poor qualiity latrines were provided with\n        a new dual pit latrine. (2) Sani-scoop hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households \n        in the compound. (3) Plastic child potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of\n        the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent\n        contact with young children. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Handwashing:</b> The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in all households. \n        The first station was located in the kitchen (location of food preparation) and the other located near the toilet. Handwashing stations were constructed from locally available materials and included\n        a dual tippy-tap design with independent pedals attached to two 5 L jerry cans of clean water and soapy water. The study provided detergent soap to families \n        free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at two critical times: \n        after defecation and before food preparation. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH):</b> Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation, \n        and handwashing study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Nutrition:</b> Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children through age 6 months. When newborns reached\n        6 months of age, mothers were encouraged to continue breastfeeding their children until 24 months, and received education about\n        supplementing breastfeeding with healthy complementary foods following infant and young child feeding best practice guidelines from\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Final_IYCF_programming_guide_2011.pdf\">Unicef</a> and\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/a85622/en/\">WHO</a>.\n        From ages 6 - 24 months, study children received a daily lipid-based nutritional supplement (LNS) that has been developed and tested\n        through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ilins.ucdavis.edu/\">iLiNS</a> project. The study also provided LNS to older, age-eligible siblings (6-24 months) \n        living in study households to prevent potential sharing of LNS with older siblings. Households were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Water quality + sanitation + handwashing + Nutrition (WSHN):</b> Households received all four of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation, \n        handwashing, and nutrition study arms, and were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Double-sized active control arm:</b> Households did not receive any intervention, but were visited monthly by community-based health promoters.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b> Passive control arm:</b> Households did not receive any intervention and were not visited by community-based health promotors.</li>\n      </ol>\n      </blockquote>\n      <b>Units of Data Collection:</b> Clusters consisted of 1 or more administrative villages; two or more neighboring may have been combined to create 1 cluster as \n      long as the cluster of villages had at least 8 eligible pregnant women and shared a border. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds \n      were groups of households (typically 1-4 households from the same extended family). When multiple pregnant women from a single compound were eligible for \n      enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Data about each compound were collected from households belonging to \n      that compound, and responses from various households about that compound's characteristics may differ. \n      Children who were born to the pregnant women initially enrolled in the study were \n      considered \"target\" children. Children aged <36 months living in the compound at enrollment and additional children born into study compounds after 6 months were \n      considered \"sibling/neighbor\" children. \n      <p />\n      <b>Data Collection:</b> A survey at enrollment (year 0, pre-intervention baseline) measured household socioeconomic characteristics and demographics (including maternal \n      age, maternal education, electricity access, type of floor, and number of people in the household), as well as water, sanitation, and handwashing infrastructure and behaviors \n      (including type of water source, reported water treatment, defecation location, type of toilet, and presence of water and soap at a handwashing station). Adherence to the \n      interventions was measured by surveying each enrolled household during unannounced visits 1 year post-intervention (midline) and 2 years post-intervention (endline). \n      Caregiver reported symptoms were assessed at enrollment, midline, and endline; anthropometry was assessed 1 at midline and endline.\n      <p />\n      <img src=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/WASHb_Kenya_data_collection_timepoints.png\" />\n      <p />\n      <b>Study Documentation:</b> Analysis protocols and replication files are available on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://osf.io/tprw2/\">Open Science Framework</a>\n      <p />\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n      <li><b>Study protocols:</b>\n        <ul>\n        <li><a target=_blank href=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/Arnold_2013-WASHb_study_design_and_rationale.pdf\">WASH-b study design and rationale</a></li>\n        <li><a target=_blank href=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/Kenya Protocol Text-v14 clean.pdf\">WASH-b Kenya main trial protocol</a></li>\n        <li><a target=_blank href=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/WBK-primary-analysis-update.pdf\">WASH-b Kenya primary outcomes analysis plan updates</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><b>Data collection forms:</b> (used to collect raw data)\n        <ul>\n        <li><a target=_blank href=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/WASH_data_collection_instruments_2012.07.31 UCB.pdf\">WASH Benefits, common modules</a></li>\n        <li><a target=_blank href=\"/documents/WASH-b_Kenya/WASHB_Rapid_Uptake_Assessment_V21_2014-02-28.pdf\">WASH Benefits Kenya, uptake assessment (adherence) forms</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><b>Codebooks:</b> (describe variables in the \"analytic\" data files loaded into ClinEpiDB.

The MAL-ED study sought to gather data that will help to identify those environmental exposures early in life that contribute to growth and developmental \n      deficits. Thus, the project's investigators took a holistic approach to assess and quantify the contribution of a large number of factors that may be associated with \n      less than optimal outcomes using an approach that had not been previously explored.

Additional visits to each household by trained field staff at various intervals were made to collect data about health, vaccinations, and \n        dietary intake, and maternal and household characteristics; to measure anthropometry; to perform cognitive tests; and to collect blood, urine, and monthly surveillance \n        (non-diarrheal) and diarrheal stool samples. \n        <blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <p />\n          <li><b>Illness Surveillance and Stool Collection:</b> During twice-weekly household visits, caregivers responded to a standardized questionnaire designed to collect a \n          daily record of symptoms of cough, fever, vomiting, diarrhea and medication use. Stool samples were collected during diarrheal episodes (defined as ≥3 loose stools in a \n          24-hour period and separated by ≥2 diarrhea-free days) and during monthly home visits (nondiarrheal specimens). Subjects experiencing moderate and severe illnesses \n          (including severe diarrhea, dysentery, acute lower respiratory infections, dehydration, and fever) were referred to local health services.</li>\n          <li><b>Physical Growth:</b> Anthropometric measurements were collected on all children monthly using standardized procedures. The weight-for-age (WAZ), length-for-age \n          (LAZ), and weight-for-length (WLZ) z scores are calculated using the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group program. The height and \n          weight of mothers were measured 2 months after delivery. </li>\n          <li><b>Microbiology:</b> All stools were analyzed for the presence of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens associated with diarrhea using traditional methods of \n          microscopy, culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as appropriate to the pathogen. </li>\n          <li><b>Nutrition (Breastfeeding Status and Dietary Intake):</b> Individual nutritional status was assessed through periodic quantitative and qualitative assessments of \n          the food consumed during the first 2 years of life. For the first 8 months, information was gathered by questioning the caregiver about the extent and duration of exclusive \n          breastfeeding and about the introduction of weaning foods collected during the twice weekly and monthly home visits. When a child was 9 months of age, the caregiver was \n          asked monthly (until 24 months of age is reached) to recall food intake over the past 24 hours to estimate caloric intake of the child and inform assessments of dietary \n          quality and diversity.</li>\n          <li><b>Micronutrients:</b> Micronutrient levels were measured in blood samples collected at 7 and 15 months of age. Hemoglobin, ferritin, and plasma transferrin receptor \n          were used to assess levels of iron, lead, zinc, retinol, argentine, and glutamine. Iodine levels were measured in urine collected at 6 and 15 months. Because the acute-phase \n          response to infections are known to affect micronutrient levels, the level of α-1-acid glycoprotein present in blood was measured to serve as a control and enable accurate \n          assessment of micronutrient status in child subjects.</li>\n          <li><b>Gut Function and Inflammation:</b> The lactulose-mannitol test was administered to study children at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 months to evaluate gut permeability and \n          absorptive capacity, respectively. Three additional proteins were also assessed to gauge aspects of gut function: α-1-antitrypsin for gut permeability, neopterin as a \n          marker of T-helper 1 immune activation, and myeloperoxidase, which is indicative of neutrophil activity. Quantitative ELISAs to detect α-1-antitrypsin, myeloperoxidase, \n          and neopterin were performed on all stool samples.</li>\n          <li><b>Vaccine Response:</b> During monthly home visits, caregivers provided information about the receipt of childhood vaccinations, including but not limited to those \n          on the schedule of the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Vaccination records were also collected (at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months), and the information \n          source (eg, vaccine card, clinical report) was recorded. The MAL-ED study measured the response to selected parenteral and oral vaccines administered as part of the EPI \n          program in each country. Blood obtained at 7 and 15 months of age was used to evaluate (by ELISA) the level of immune response to pertussis toxin, measles, tetanus toxoid, \n          poliovirus types 1, 2, 3, and rotavirus by ELISA. Poliovirus neutralization titers were also determined.</li>\n          <li><b>Cognitive Development:</b> The cognitive development of each child was assessed through periodic administration of several validated instruments: the Bayley Scales \n          of Infant Development to assess global capacity (at 6, 15, and 24 months); the Infant Temperament Scale to assess infant temperament (at 6 months); and the MacArthur Adapted \n          Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Gestures (at 8, 15, and 24 months) to assess language development. The quality and quantity of stimulation and support \n          available to the child in his or her home environment was assessed with the HOME Inventory (at 6 and 24 months). <i>Cognitive development data is not currently available \n          on ClinEpiDB.org.</i></li>\n        </ul>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p />\n        The Scientific and Administrative Core provides leadership in coordinating the scientific activities across the network through technical subcommittees for surveillance, \n        microbiology, cognitive development, nutrition, gut function, and vaccine immunogenicity.

During this period, children are also at risk for undernutrition.\n      <p />\n      Beyond the acute morbidity and suffering caused by enteric infections and undernutrition, observational evidence\n      also suggests that repeated infections alone and in combination with undernutrition in the first years of life can\n      have lasting and detrimental effects on longer-term physical growth, cognitive development, and adult human capital.\n      <p />\n      The WASH Benefits studies provide rigorous evidence on the health and developmental benefits of water quality,\n      sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions during the first years of life. A cluster-randomized controlled\n      trial measured the impact of intervention among newborn infants in rural Bangladesh. The study is large in scope\n      (> 5,000 newborns) and has seven arms (six treatment arms and a control arm). Primary outcomes were measured after\n      two years of intervention.     \n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The goal of the WASH Benefits studies is to generate rigorous evidence about the impacts of\n      sanitation, water quality, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child health and development in the first years of\n      life.

(2) Sani-scoop \n        hoes dedicated to the removal of human and animal feces from the compound were provided to all households in the compound. (3) Plastic child \n        potties were provided to all households in the compound that had any children younger than 3 years. The behavior change components of\n        the intervention emphasized the use of the latrine for defecation and the safe disposal of feces in the compound courtyard to prevent\n        contact with young children.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b>Handwashing:</b> The hardware components of the handwashing intervention included two handwashing stations installed in the households\n        of target children.

The second station was located near the toilet, and included a 40-liter bucket with tap fitting, \n        stool, bowl and soapy water bottle. The study provided detergent soap to families free of charge to replenish the soapy water bottles. The behavior change component of\n        the intervention focused messaging for handwashing at critical times: after defecation, after cleaning a child who has defecated, before food preparation,\n        and before eating or feeding a child.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b>Water quality + sanitation + handwashing (WSH):</b> Households received all three of the interventions given to the the water quality, sanitation, \n        and handwashing study arms.</li>\n        <p />\n        <li><b>Nutrition:</b> The nutrition intervention targeted target children.

More than one cluster could have been enrolled in a single village but clusters needed to be separated from each \n      other by a minimum of 15 min (1km) walking distance. Households were the family unit of parents and children, and compounds were groups of \n      households (typically 3-10 households from the same extended family) that share a common courtyard. When multiple pregnant women from a single \n      compound were eligible for enrollment, more than one household may have been enrolled for that compound. Children who were born to the pregnant\n      women initially enrolled in the study were considered \"target\" (or index) children.

  "description": "<b>Background:</b> The efficacy and safety of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (oral PrEP), a fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or TDF alone, has been established for preventing the transmission of HIV among high-risk HIV negative individuals and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an additional HIV prevention tool. Kenya has made considerable progress in its HIV response, but HIV prevalence remains high in certain geographic pockets, among key populations (female sex workers - FSW, and men who have sex with men - MSM), and among certain vulnerable groups such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Substantial work is needed to lower HIV transmission rates among these groups, who have higher prevalence and lower ART use compared to the general population. \n      <p />\n      The utility of PrEP has expanded to high-risk individuals not identified as key populations or individuals in sero-discordant relationships. Kenya, through the 2017 PrEP Implementation Framework recognized the need to offer PrEP for any willing individual perceived to be at a \"substantial risk\", thus tactfully framing it as a public health intervention and preventing stigmatization. Programs implementing scale up in Kenya and other nations in sub-Saharan Africa therefore anticipate unsolicited demand for PrEP and have been morally obligated to offer the intervention to all those requesting for it even when they are not part of their target populations.\n      <p />\n      The Jilinde project is serving as a \"learning laboratory,\" which informs as well as evaluates programmatic decisions, and is facilitating iterative explorations of different models of PrEP implementation at scale to fit a real-market, low-resource context. Through addressing the critical domains of demand, supply, and government and community ownership of oral PrEP, Jilinde is generating critical lessons on the feasibility and effectiveness of scaling up oral PrEP in low- and middle-income countries. \n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate delivery, uptake and continuation of oral PrEP by key target groups (MSM and FSW), AGYW, individuals in HIV sero-discordant relationships, and other high-risk individuals in Kenya. Specific objectives:\n      <p />\n        <ol>\n        \t<li>To assess changes in client (user), community and stakeholder (including parents with AGYW) perception and behavior towards the delivery of oral PrEP services.</li>\n        \t<li>To describe trends in client HIV-risk and risk perceptions and their association with uptake, adherence and continuation for PrEP services across the key populations, AGYW, individuals in sero-discordant relationships and other high-risk individuals.</li>\n          <li>To describe barriers and facilitators (including stigma to oral PrEP and to key populations, AGYW, individuals in sero-discordant relationships and other high-risk individuals) for uptake and continuation of oral PrEP in the Bridge to Scale project sites.</li>\n        </ol>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b> \n      <blockquote>\n        <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> Data were collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Bridge to Scale (Jilinde) project was implemented. These include Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Kisumu, Kisii and Migori counties. \n        <p />\n        <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> March 2018 to April 2021. \n        <p />\n        <b>Study Design:</b> \n        <p />\n        <b>Prospective cohort study</b> - 1,135 clients (MSM, AGYW and FSWs) who were already in contact with oral PrEP services were recruited for a prospective cohort survey. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire at baseline, three (3), six (6), and twelve (12) months. This cohort was used to determine in depth, beyond the routinely collected clinical data, how social, behavioral, and psychological factors (depressive symptoms, substance use and perceived or experienced stigma) influence their risk profile, risk perceptions, uptake, and risk compensation. The focus of this cohort was to generate hypotheses about how risk, risk perceptions and both perceived and experienced stigma influence PrEP uptake, retention, and adherence and how risk perceptions change over time among key populations and AGYW encountering oral PrEP services. \n        <p />\n        To complement the survey questionnaire a diary card was introduced to participants on the cohort. The card was introduced after the end of the baseline interview, which coincided with the initial PrEP visit. This card served as a diarized log that was provided to willing new PrEP clients to be filled during the first 28 days following PrEP initiation. To optimize response rate, it was collected a month after PrEP initiation. We issued diary cards to 890 participants and 764 completed diary cards were returned. The diary assisted to map PrEP use to risky behaviors on a day-to-day basis to generate hypotheses about the existence of event-driven PrEP use within the Kenyan context. Participants were provided a detailed description and practical illustration about how to complete the card. \n        <p />\n        <b>Qualitative cross-sectional studies</b> - Qualitative studies were conducted in parallel to the prospective cohort to describe patterns, barriers and enablers of PrEP uptake, adherence, and continuation. These studies were repeated bi-annually on similar but different participants using follow-up guides to document emerging trends in behavior, knowledge, and perceptions towards oral PrEP. The sampling of participants took into consideration sex, age, roles, and years of practice at each study point to increase richness and robustness of the data collected. Data collection methods included key informant interviews (KIIs), In-depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). These were moderated by trained qualitative researchers using an appropriate language for each target audience. Participants were sampled from the catchment of health facilities from which oral PrEP was being offered. They included community opinion leaders, health care providers and managers, parents of AGYW, peer educators, community health volunteers, key populations, AGYW, and other oral PrEP clients including individuals in sero-discordant relationships and other high-risk individuals.\n        <p />\n        <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> The eligibility criteria for participant segments of interest and key informants are described as follows.\n        <ol>\n        \t<li>MSM - Males who engage in sexual activity with members of same sex, regardless of how they identify themselves.

After consenting procedures were completed, participants proceeded to the data collection phase as described below.\n       <p />\n       <b>Prospective cohort for the PrEP clients</b>: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was completed by a trained research assistant at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Data collectors were experienced quantitative interviewers who had undergone training on data collection procedures, the tools and ethics training. The questionnaire was inbuilt into a secure mobile-based data collection device (Tablet) and data linked to a REDCap account hosted by Jhpiego. Detailed security procedures were implemented in order to access the data. During the baseline interview, the interviewer obtained data from the participant using the already approved questions in the baseline tool. This included questions on their sexual behavior and PrEP and alcohol use for each of the last 14 days. During this time, the interviewer walked with the participant as they mapped each response backwards up to 14 days using the timeline follow back methodology validated by Sobell and Sobell (1992). After that, the interviewer introduced the participant to the self-completed diary card. The interviewer provided a clear explanation to the participant on how to complete and securely store the diary. This included an illustration about how to complete the diary card for at least three days. The interviewer then gave an appointment date on which the diary card was to be returned, where the card was to be collected and thanked the participant. During the follow-up interviews, the trained research assistants completed the follow-up questionnaire to the same cohort at 3, 6, and 12 months from the time of enrolment. Each participant was assigned a unique code while locator and contact details collected from each participant were used by the Research Assistant to trace participants in case they failed to honor the follow-up appointments.  \n       <p />\n       <b>Qualitative Studies</b>: These constituted FGDs (with health providers, AGYW, peer educators, MSM and FSW), KII (with community resource persons and health managers) and IDI's (AGYW and parents of AGYW). Homogeneous groups of participants were invited separately and data collection conducted in private spaces within PrEP sites or in community halls. Participants were invited prior to the exact date of data collection and details of the venue and time communicated clearly. The interviews were moderated by trained qualitative researchers and were audio recorded with consent from the participants. Additional handwritten notes were taken by a scribe and later typed to generate a summary of the interview. Interview guides were employed by the moderators to lead discussions in focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews. The audio-recorded data files were later transcribed, and those in Kiswahili or local language (dholuo) were translated into English language and back-translated to ensure that the original meaning was maintained. Comparisons were done between the typed handwritten notes and the transcripts. \n        <p />\n        <b>Study Documentation:</b> Data dictionaries will be made available once finalized.\n      <p />\n      <b>ClinEpiDB Data Integration:</b> Details will be made available once data integration is completed.\n      <p />\n      <b>Financial Support:</b> The Jilinde project was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under investment number INV-007340.

Uganda was the first country to implement universal distribution of free long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) starting in 2014, with repeated campaigns every 3-4 years. Uganda \n      also has one of the largest indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) programs, focusing on selected high transmission districts using different formulations of insecticides rotated every few years. \n      <p />\n      The success of this intensive approach to vector control has been well documented in Tororo District, a historically high transmission area of southeastern Uganda. IRS was first implemented in Tororo \n      District in December 2014, initially using a carbamate (Bendiocarb), then switching to an organophosphate (Actellic) in 2016. Comparing key malaria indicators measured from 2011-2014 (prior to IRS) \n      with indicators in 2017-2019 (after two rounds of universal LLIN distribution and 5 years of sustained IRS), a 500-fold decrease in malaria transmission intensity, a 60-fold decrease in \n      the incidence of symptomatic malaria, and a 5-fold decrease in parasite prevalence among children 0.5 to 10 years of age were documented. In addition, over this time frame there was a marked shift in the predominant \n      vector species from <i>An. gambiae s.s.</i> to <i>An. arabiensis</i>. \n      <p />\n      However, a marked resurgence of malaria cases in 2020 was documented using health facility-based data from 5 districts of Uganda (including Tororo), reaching pre-IRS levels within 1-2 years. \n      This coincided with a change to clothianidin-based formulations of IRS (Fludora Fusion/SumiShield) in 2019-2020.\n      <p />\n      To quantify the magnitude of the resurgence, investigate causes, and evaluate the impact of a shift back to IRS with Actellic in 2023, the PRISM Border\n      Cohort study assessed changes in malaria metrics in regions within and near Tororo District.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> To better quantify the magnitude of the malaria resurgence in Tororo and to investigate potential causes, the PRISM Border Cohort compared temporal changes in malaria incidence, \n      prevalence, and entomological measures between September 2020 and September 2023 in a cohort of 667 residents living in two areas within Tororo District and in neighboring Busia District, \n      where IRS has never been implemented.

A wealth index was generated for each household using principal components analysis based on common assets and categorized into tertiles. \n      <p />\n      The cohort was dynamic, such that over the course of the study any permanent residents that joined a household were screened for enrollment. Cohort study participants were encouraged to come to \n      a dedicated study clinic open 7 days per week for all their medical care. \n      <p />\n      Routine visits were conducted every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation and collection of blood by finger prick/heel stick (if < 6 months of age) or venipuncture (if aged 6 months and older) \n      for thick blood smear, hemoglobin measurement (every 12 weeks), and storage for future molecular studies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal coverage of populations at risk, defined as one net for every two people to achieve community benefits. \n      <p />\n      In Uganda, LLINs are the primary vector control intervention, and considerable  effort has been made to achieve universal coverage. However, to date, LLINs have not had the desired impact on malaria burden in Uganda. High levels of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors may be contributing to the limited impact of LLINs. \n      <p />\n      All LLINs are currently treated with pyrethroid insecticides due to their favorable safety profile at low doses, repellent effects, and rapid killing. However, pyrethroid resistance has been reported across Africa and could threaten malaria control. Unpublished data suggests that pyrethroid resistance is widespread across Uganda.\n      <p />\n      The threat of pyrethroid resistance has generated interest in combining more than one insecticide mixture in LLINs. One approach is to combine a pyrethroid insecticide with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which is capable of inhibiting cytochrome P450s, to potentially overcome pyrethroid resistance in anopheline vectors. \n      <p />\n      LLINs that include PBO are anticipated to be more effective in areas where pyrethroid resistance is mediated by P450s. However, the impact of PBO LLINs is expected to vary according to the bioavailability and retention of PBO, and the level, intensity, and mechanisms of insecticide resistance for local vectors, as well as across different transmission settings.\n      <p />\n      Evidence of the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO) is urgently needed. The Uganda National Malaria Control Program and implementing partners carried out a universal LLIN campaign in 2016-17, supported by generous contributions from international donors, including The Against Malaria Foundation, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the US President's Malaria Initiative, The AIDS Support Organisation, and the UK's Department for International Development. LLINs were distributed at no cost to all Ugandan households through a mass-distribution campaign. LLINs with, and without, PBO were distributed, presenting an opportunity to rigorously evaluate and compare the performance of combination LLINs (with PBO) and conventional LLINs (without PBO) on a wide-scale across a variety of malaria transmission intensities, vector ecologies, and insecticide resistance patterns. Following WHO guidance for robust evaluation of PBO nets, a cluster-randomized trial was carried out to compare the impact of LLINs with, and without, PBO in Uganda.\n      <br />\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The goal of the LLINEUP trial was to evaluate the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO), as compared to conventional LLINs (without PBO), on parasite prevalence, in Eastern and Western Uganda.\n      <p />\n      <b>Primary scientific objective:</b>\n      <p /> \n      The trial tested the hypothesis that parasite prevalence will be lower in intervention clusters (health sub-districts randomized to receive PBO nets), than in control clusters (health sub-districts randomized to conventional nets) overall, and stratified by region (Eastern and Western regions).\n      <p />\n      <b>Secondary scientific objectives:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of PermaNet 3.0 (with PBO), as compared to PermaNet 2.0 (without PBO), on parasite prevalence.</li>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of Olyset Plus (with PBO), as compared to Olyset Net (without PBO), on parasite prevalence.</li>\n        <li>To determine factors associated with effectiveness of LLINs with PBO, as compared to LLINs without PBO, including the level of \n        insecticide resistance.</li>\n        <li>To assess net survivorship, durability, and bio-efficacy in Uganda.</li>\n      </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> The LLINEUP study was conducted in 104 health sub-districts (clusters) in 48 districts in Eastern and Western Uganda. \n      <br />\n      <img src=\"/documents/LLINEUP/6_Fig1_map_17sept19-1.png\" width=\"40%\" />\n      <p />\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> March 2017 -

A household survey was the conducted to collect household-level information on the use of malaria interventions and treatment-seeking practices. All households were given a long lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN).\n      <p />\n      <u>Cohort Study Follow-Up:</u> Routine visits at the study clinic occurred once every 4 weeks and included a standardized evaluation. At each routine visit, participants under 6 months had blood collected by a finger prick/heel stick and those over 6 months had a venipuncture with 2.5-15 mL of blood collected based on their weight. Blood was used for a thick blood smear, to measure hemoglobin levels (every 12 weeks), for filter paper samples, and stored for additional studies.\n      <p />\n      Study participants received all medical care free of charge at a designated study clinic open every day, and were encouraged to come to the clinic any time they became ill. For any participant presenting to the clinic (for a routine or non-routine visit) with documented fever (tympanic temp >= 38C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hr, blood was obtained by finger prick for a thick blood smear. Smear-positive patients were diagnosed with malaria, hemoglobin measurements were obtained, and a thin blood smear was performed for parasite species identification. Episodes of uncomplicated malaria were treated with artemether + lumefantrine (AL). Complicated malaria (severe malaria or danger signs) or recurrent malaria within 14 d of prior therapy was treated with quinine or IV artesunate.\n      <p />\n      <u>Entomological surveys:</u> Surveys were conducted every 2 weeks in each household. A collection was done in all rooms where study participants slept. Mosquitoes were collected using miniature CDC light traps with the light positioned 1 meter above the floor at the foot of the bed where a cohort study participant slept. Traps were set at 19.00h and collected at 07.00h the following morning. Presence and use of LLINs was also recorded. Female <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes were counted and identified taxonomically to species level (<i>A. gambia s.l</i>,<i> A. funestus</i>, or \"other\") based on morphological criteria according to established taxonomic keys. Members of the <i>An. gambiae</i> complex were identified by PCR. Sporozoites were identified in individual mosquitoes stored with desiccant using ELISA.\n      <p />\n      <u>Population Level Vector Control Interventions:</u> Universal Long-lasting insecticide treated bednet (LLIN) campaigns were carried out in November 2013 and June 2017. There have been 7 rounds of district wide indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Bendiocarb was administered December 2014-January 2015, June-July 2015, and November-December 2015.

However, the effectiveness of LLINs is threatened by widespread pyrethroid resistance. In the first LLINEUP trial, we found that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) LLINs were superior to conventional LLINs. However, PBO LLINs have several potential limitations. PBO is a synergist, not an insecticide, and can only restore sensitivity of pyrethroid insecticides if resistance is due to specific metabolic mechanisms. Moreover, PBO cannot fully restore susceptibility in all resistant mosquito populations. \n    <p />\n    Newer dual active-ingredient LLINs treated with a combination of insecticides using different modes of action are attractive alternatives; these LLINs may provide greater protection and delay the spread of insecticide resistance, but like PBO LLINs, they are more expensive than conventional nets. Further evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pyriproxyfen (PPF)-treated LLINs is urgently needed. Royal Guard LLINs, treated with alphacypermethrin and PPF, are one of only two dual active-ingredient LLINs prequalified by the WHO which are available for widescale distribution. \n    <p />\n    In Uganda, the National Malaria Control Division (NMCD) and implementing partners were planning to deliver LLINs nationwide in 2020, through a mass distribution campaign supported by generous contributions from international donors. LLINs would be distributed free-of-charge to all Ugandan households, aiming to achieve universal coverage. The Against Malaria Foundation had agreed to provide LLINs treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus PPF (Royal Guard, Disease Control Technology) and LLINs treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus PBO (PermaNet 3.0, Vestergaard), presenting an opportunity to rigorously evaluate and compare these two LLINs at scale across Uganda. In collaboration with the MOH, a cluster-randomised trial was embedded to compare the impact of LLINs with PPF to LLINs with PBO into Uganda’s 2020 LLIN distribution campaign, as was done successfully for the last LLIN distribution campaign conducted in 2017-18.  \n    <p />\n    A major strength of LLINEUP2 is the use of malaria incidence as the primary outcome measure. Incidence of malaria, defined as the number of symptomatic cases of malaria occurring in a population at risk over time, is the gold standard for assessing malaria burden. However, cluster-randomised trials using malaria incidence as the primary outcome are very expensive and logistically challenging. A novel approach for measuring malaria incidence in this trial is to utilize data collected routinely at health facilities. By defining catchment areas around health facilities and collecting data on the location of residence of patients diagnosed with malaria, we were able to generate longitudinal measures of malaria incidence at an unprecedented scale across Uganda. \n    <p />\n    Finally, there is an urgent need to better understand the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in Uganda. To our knowledge, no published studies have evaluated how malaria control and care have evolved in Uganda since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is partly because of limited testing available for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in rural communities where the burden of malaria is highest. Given the platform provided by the Malaria Reference Center (MRC) surveillance, we were uniquely poised to evaluate the association between malaria and evidence of prior exposure to COVID-19 across Uganda. These results will inform policies and programmes for both malaria and COVID-19 in Uganda. \n    <br />\n    <p />\n    <b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of LLINs treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus pyriproxyfen (PPF LLINs), as compared to LLINs treated with a pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), on malaria incidence in Uganda. We will test the hypothesis that malaria incidence will be lower in intervention clusters (randomized to receive PPF LLINs) than in control clusters (randomized to receive PBO LLINs).\n      <p />\n      <b>Secondary objectives:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of PPF LLINs vs PBO LLINs on parasite prevalence, anaemia, and vector density</li>\n        <li>To estimate the cost-effectiveness of delivering PPF LLINs, as compared to PBO LLINs</li>\n        <li>To assess net durability, survivorship and use of PPF LLINs vs PBO LLINs</li>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria burden and care in Uganda</li>\n      </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> With the Ministry of Health, a high-quality malaria surveillance program was established.
