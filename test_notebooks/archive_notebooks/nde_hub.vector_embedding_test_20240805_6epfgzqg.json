  "description": "ACTT is a clinical trial platform sponsored by NIAID to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The studies are a multicenter trial and will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The studies will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm.  New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.   The initial iteration of ACTT (ACTT-1) evaluated Remdesivir vs placebo.  Participants had to have a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and meet one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrollment: radiographic infiltrates by imaging study, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).   Remdesivir was administered intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose administered daily on days 2 through 10 or until hospital discharge or death. A matching placebo was administered according to the same schedule and in the same volume as the active drug. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites: United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1).   Participants were assessed daily during their hospitalization, from day 1 through day 29. The participant’s clinical status on an eight-category ordinal scale, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and other clinical data was recorded each day. All serious adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events that represented an increase in severity from day 1 and any grade 2 or higher suspected drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were recorded. Upon discharge, participants had intermittent study visits through Day 29.  The final follow-up for all participants was Day 29."

  "description": "The MARM-TB-FDT dataset contains the PET/CT scans from common marmosets infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and imaged with FDG ([¹⁸F]Fluorodeoxyglucose) or FDT ([¹⁸F]Fluorodeoxytrehalose) during experiments to characterize the distribution of FDT into marmoset tissues during MTB infection. Trehalose is incorporated into the outer leaflet of MTB and so can, when labeled, be captured in bacteria, and infected cells where MTB are present. FDT is a 18 F positron-emitting non-mammalian disaccharide trehalose that can be used as probe to detect regions of mycobacterium infection. It was developed in a collaboration between Oxford University and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. This data set documents the preclinical non-human primate scans collected during this initial characterization of the probe’s performance. The dataset consists of multiple scans of 10 common marmosets (both infected and naïve) and two MTB- infected cynomolgus macaques. A excel read-me file lists the scans available in the data set."

  "description": "This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression.  The study includes both infused and non-infused agents and is a randomized controlled platform that allows agents to be added and dropped during the course of the study for efficient phase II and phase III testing of new agents within the same trial infrastructure.  Version 7 of the protocol provided for blinded phase II evaluation of an investigational agent for superiority to placebo among participants at lower risk of progression to hospitalization or death, regardless of the mode of administration of the agent.  Agents that graduate to phase III after initiation of the protocol version will be evaluated in persons at higher risk for progression to hospitalization or death for non-inferiority to an active comparator (monoclonal antibody cocktail of casirivimab plus imdevimab (REGEN-COV, Regeneron). This active comparator has been shown to be effective in this population in preventing hospitalization or death. When two or more agents are being evaluated in the same phase of the study, the trial design includes sharing of the control group (placebo in phase II and active comparator in phase III) for efficient evaluation of each agent.  Investigational agents will be approved by the Trial Oversight Committee (TOC) for phase II evaluation based on the presence of in vitro data demonstrating promise as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics in pre-clinical testing, and for which there are suitable pharmacokinetics and safety data from phase I testing, or through clinical or research testing for a different indication, and agent availability. Investigational agents will be included in phase III evaluation based on agent entry criteria for phase III as outlined in the protocol (or by TOC approval based on data available outside ACTIV-2)."

  "description": "The ACTIV-1 (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) clinical trial enrolled 1971 patients at 85 sites in the US and Latin America between October 2020 and December 2021.  Subjects were randomized to one of the substudies currently active in the study, and then to either the investigational agent (abatacept, infliximab, cenicriviroc) or its matching placebo. The study analyses compared each active therapy against a pooled placebo population consisting of placebo recipients from all three sub-studies (those accrued during the time the sub-study was actively enrolling). The efficacy of each therapeutic agent as add-on therapy to standard of care was evaluated based on the primary endpoint of time to recovery by Day 29. Key secondary objectives of this study were mortality and clinical improvement. Comparisons of the agents among themselves was not a research objective.  The cenicriviroc (CVC) sub-study was closed to enrollment on September 3, 2021, due to futility.  Evaluations of efficacy also included 8-point Ordinal Scale, incidence, and duration of new oxygen use, and (as an exploratory assessment) National Early Warning Score (NEWS). Safety was evaluated with laboratory and adverse event assessments, as well as evaluations of extrapulmonary manifestations.  Blood was collected at select sites for future secondary research.  Trial participants were assessed daily while hospitalized through Day 29 or discharge. Outpatient follow-up study visits occurred on Days 8, 11, 15 and 29. Follow up assessments by phone occurred at Days 22 and 60 to assess clinical status and adverse events.  The results for this study are available as three separate datasets, one for each sub-study. Enrollment numbers for each sub-study, including the randomization within each sub-study (active vs. matched placebo) and the pooled placebo population for analysis, are as follows:  For Abatacept: Active Drug: 524; Matched Placebo: 214; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 525.  For Infliximab: Active Drug: 531; Matched Placebo: 215; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 530.  For CVC: Active Drug: 360; Matched Placebo: 127; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 363.<br></br><br></br> ACTIV-1 biospecimen samples may be requested via the <a href='https://activ-biorep.org/'>ACTIV virtual biorepository page</a>.

  "description": "Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) study ( https://script.northwestern.edu/) is a cohort of critically ill patients from a prospective single-center observational study of patients who were hospitalized in a medical ICU, required mechanical ventilation, and received a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) given suspicion for pneumonia.  SCRIPT seeks to delineate the host/pathogen interactions during pneumonia using multiomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid joined with clinical data and physician adjudication.  There are 273 patients in the cohort with median [IQR] age of 62 [42,70].  74 had SARS-CoV-2, 33 had pneumonia secondary to other respiratory viruses, 133 had other pneumonia (bacterial), and 33 were initially suspected of having pneumonia yet subsequently adjudicated as having respiratory failure unrelated to pneumonia (non-pneumonia controls). 31.9% of the cohort had an unfavorable outcome defined as deceased.  Dataset - ‘02_clinical_data.csv’ is a data table that has each BAL sample (273 patients) presented in a single row, along with 30 columns that represent demographic and clinical metadata. The clinical features include laboratory and physiologic parameters, which are examined daily in the practice of physician rounds."

  "description": "This was a prospective observational cohort surveillance study of approximately 1100 adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Detailed information was collected regarding patient history and onset of illness upon enrollment. Participants had longitudinal assessments of clinical status, and pertinent clinical data (including clinical laboratory values, radiographic findings, medication use, oxygen and ventilatory support requirements, complications, etc.) was recorded. In parallel, the study conducted serial biologic sampling for detailed immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive picture of immune changes that occurred throughout the course of infection. The biological samples collected included blood, nasal swabs, and endotracheal aspirates. Participants were followed in hospital through Day 28, unless discharged earlier. If a participant required an escalation to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level care, either within or outside of a dedicated ICU, additional samples were collected within 24 and 96 hours of care escalation. Convalescent questionnaires and biological samples were collected at 3-month intervals up to Month 12 after discharge, if available. In addition, if a participant was discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28, attempts were made to collect additional scheduled assessments through Day 28 on an outpatient basis, if feasible. The ImmPort Study Accession ID for IMPACC is SDY1760, with additional proteomics data available in SDY2112."
