To synergize hypothesis building and testing, we designed the Pathogen Associated Drosophila MicroArray (PADMA) database for easy retrieval and comparison of microarray results from immunity-related experiments (www.padmadatabase.org). PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis. Thus, the PADMA database will be a useful resource to fly researchers to evaluate, revise, and refine hypotheses.","{'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Computational biology'}","{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Agricultural science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Infectious disease'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}"

Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling this endogenous programme can provide functional and evolutionary insights into the circannual biological clock and the potential of migratory species to adapt to changing environments. Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1). Numerous genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and motility were differentially expressed (including RHOJ, PAK1 and TLN1), suggesting that migration-related changes are regulated by seasonal neural plasticity.","{'Gene expression', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Neurology', 'Gene expression', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'Animal study'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}"

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Critical care medicine', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study'}"
ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Rare diseases'}"

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Zoology', 'DNA binding sites', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Reproductive health', 'Sequence analysis', 'Laboratory animal science', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Animal study', 'DNA replication and recombination'}"

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}"

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'RNA', 'DNA mutation', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetic variation', 'Zoology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Proteins', 'Enzymes', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study'}"

We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Microfluidics', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Mapping'}"

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Biodiversity', 'Genomics', 'Microbial ecology'}"

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Agricultural science', 'Drug discovery', 'Pathology', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease'}"

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genomics', 'Animal study', 'Cardiology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Model organisms', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Embryology'}"

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Software engineering', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Synthetic biology', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology', 'Synthetic chemistry'}"

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Proteogenomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics'}"

This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}"

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Gene expression', 'Cytogenetics', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Proteins', 'Human genetics', 'Immunology', 'Biobank'}"

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Zoology', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Small molecules', 'Mouse clinic', 'Animal study'}"

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Gene structure', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Comparative genomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Plant biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene transcripts'}"

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Proteins', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Zoology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Synthetic biology', 'Embryology', 'Drug metabolism'}"

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Microbial collection', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbon cycle'}"

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Protein variants', 'Animal study'}"

This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sample collections', 'Animal study'}"

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Human genetics', 'Open science', 'Human biology'}"

The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I. These results clarify the functional role of PfAP2-G during sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Parasitology', 'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Gene expression', 'Parasitology', 'DNA binding sites', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Gene regulation'}"

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Gene expression', 'Cytogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biomarkers', 'Proteins', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics'}"

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Software engineering', 'Human biology', 'Nucleic acids', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Zoology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Small molecules', 'Animal study'}"

We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Microbiology', 'Cell biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genomics'}"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Developmental biology', 'Mouse clinic.', 'Genetics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Gene expression', 'Cell biology', 'Systems biology', 'Protein interactions', 'Stem cells', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenetics', 'Molecular genetics'}"

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Synthetic microbial community', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Gene regulation', 'Methanotroph', 'Environmental sciences', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system', 'Carbon cycle'}"

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Cell biology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics'}"

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biotechnology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Oncology'}"

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Among several metabolites formed, 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium. Although sulcotrione has a chemical structure closely resembling that of mesotrione, the isolates were unable to degrade it.","{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Drug metabolism', 'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biodegradation', 'Soil', 'Bacteria', 'Agricultural science'}"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Many cellular models aimed at elucidating cancer biology do not recapitulate pathobiology including tumor heterogeneity, an inherent feature of cancer that underlies treatment resistance. Here we introduce a cancer modeling paradigm using genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that captures authentic cancer pathobiology. Orthotopic engraftment of the neural progenitor cells derived from hiPSCs that have been genome-edited to contain tumor-associated genetic driver mutations revealed by The Cancer Genome Atlas project for glioblastoma (GBM) results in formation of high-grade gliomas. Similar to patient-derived GBM, these models harbor inter-tumor heterogeneity resembling different GBM molecular subtypes, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and extrachromosomal DNA amplification. Re-engraftment of these primary tumor neurospheres generates secondary tumors with features characteristic of patient samples and present mutation-dependent patterns of tumor evolution. These cancer avatar models provide a platform for comprehensive longitudinal assessment of human tumor development as governed by molecular subtype mutations and lineage-restricted differentiation.","{'Genetic engineering', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'DNA mutation', 'Cell biology', 'Cancer', 'Tumor heterogeneity', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Stem cells', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Biotechnology', 'Drug discovery', 'Molecular biology', 'Drug development', 'Epigenetics', 'Genomics', 'Oncology'}"
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Geochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}"

The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I. These results clarify the functional role of PfAP2-G during sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Parasitology', 'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Parasitology', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics'}"

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Cytogenetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', '""Immunology', 'Genomics', 'Oncology""'}"

In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.","{'Protein binding sites', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Proteomics', 'Bioinformatics'}"

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Cell biology', 'Metastasis', 'Cancer', 'Genetics', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Molecular biology', 'Tumor suppressor', 'MicroRNA', 'Therapeutic targets', 'Chemokine receptor', 'Biochemistry', 'Migration', 'Genomics'}"

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Medicinal chemistry'}","{'Systems biology', 'Drug target predictions', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genomics', 'Genetic network engineering'}"

gpt-4,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Transcriptomics', 'Structural biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Microbiology', 'Data mining', 'Plant biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Agricultural science', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Molecular modelling', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'DNA', 'Infectious disease', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology'}"
gpt-4,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Biobank', 'Phylogeny', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Epigenomics', 'DNA binding sites', 'Molecular evolution', 'Data analysis', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data management', 'Immunomics', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Metabolomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Cardiology', 'Safety sciences', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Zoology', 'Structural genomics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Systems medicine', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Toxicology', 'Embryology', 'Open science', 'Genetic variation', 'Protein interactions', 'Data quality management', 'Protein expression', 'Translational medicine', 'Omics', 'Bioengineering', 'Data visualisation', 'Phylogenomics', 'Human genetics', 'Taxonomy', 'Structural variation', 'Immunology', 'Database management', 'Biology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Epigenetics', 'Population genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Molecular biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Data rescue', 'Metatranscriptomics', 'Medicine', 'Data acquisition', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'X-ray diffraction', 'Cladistics', 'Multiomics', 'Phenomics', 'Laboratory information management', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Phylogenetics', 'Quality affairs', 'Population genetics', 'Neurobiology', 'Structure prediction', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Sequence assembly', 'Synthetic biology', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Medical informatics', 'Function analysis', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Sequence composition, complexity and repeats', 'Data governance', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biophysics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Veterinary medicine', 'Functional genomics', 'DNA mutation', 'Sequence sites, features and motifs', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Genetics', 'Workflows', 'Virology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Structure analysis', 'Biomolecular simulation', 'Data security', 'Immunogenetics', 'Sample collections', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Informatics'}"

Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1).

gpt-4,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Methane cycle', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Molecular evolution', 'Data management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Metabolomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial collection', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Structural genomics', 'Marine biology', 'Proteogenomics', 'Systems medicine', 'Microbiology', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Metagenomics', 'Open science', 'Genetic variation', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein expression', 'Bioengineering', 'Data visualisation', 'Taxonomy', 'Database management', 'Biology', 'Chemical biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Ecology', 'Data acquisition', 'Carbon cycle', 'Structural biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Multiomics', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Gene structure', 'Microbial ecology', 'Chemistry', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Gene expression', 'Clone library', 'Protein structure analysis', 'Protein properties', 'Enzymes', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Functional genomics', 'Biodiversity', 'Sequence sites, features and motifs', 'DNA', 'Protein modifications.', 'Genetics', 'Biosciences', 'Biomolecular simulation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Sample collections', 'Biochemistry', 'Synthetic biology', 'Informatics'}"

gpt-4,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Systems biology', 'Computational biology', 'Biobank', 'Drug discovery', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Epigenomics', 'DNA binding sites', 'Molecular evolution', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Protein targeting and localisation', 'FAIR data', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Molecular medicine', 'Protein folds and structural domains', 'Human biology', 'Metabolomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Safety sciences', 'Infectious disease', 'Gene regulation', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Cell culture collection', 'Structural genomics', 'Workflow', 'Proteogenomics', 'Systems medicine', 'Protein variants', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Microbiology', 'Proteomics', 'Molecular genetics', 'Metagenomics', 'Nucleic acid structure analysis', 'Open science', 'Genetic variation', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Protein interactions', 'Protein expression', 'Public health and epidemiology', 'Translational medicine', 'Omics', 'Protein secondary structure', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Bioengineering', 'Data visualisation', 'Natural language processing', 'Drug development', 'Phylogenomics', 'Human genetics', 'Immunology', 'Database management', 'DNA packaging', 'Biology', 'Electron microscopy', 'Genetic engineering', 'Epigenetics', 'Population genomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Mapping', 'Molecular biology', 'Data rescue', 'Metatranscriptomics', 'Data acquisition', 'Medicine', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'X-ray diffraction', 'Multiomics', 'Copy number variation', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Laboratory information management', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Phylogenetics', 'Quality affairs', 'Gene structure', 'Software engineering.', 'Neutron diffraction', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Population genetics', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Structure prediction', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Protein structural motifs and surfaces', 'Synthetic biology', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Clone library', 'Medical informatics', 'NMR', 'Protein structure analysis', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Protein properties', 'Enzymes', 'Data governance', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biophysics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Animal study', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Functional genomics', 'DNA mutation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'DNA', 'RNA splicing', 'Trauma medicine', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Genetics', 'Virology', 'RNA', 'Rare diseases', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Compound libraries and screening', 'Structure analysis', 'Data security', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Immunogenetics', 'Protein modifications', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Informatics'}"
gpt-4,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'DNA mutation', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Systems biology', 'Chemical biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Biomedical science', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Personalised medicine', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Protein interactions', 'Oncology', 'Haematology', 'Protein expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Genomics', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Human biology', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Human genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunology', 'Biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology'}"
gpt-4,"DNA recombination is required for effective segregation and diversification of genomes and for the successful completion of meiosis. Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Nucleic acids', 'Molecular evolution', 'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Proteins', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene structure', 'Genome evolution', 'DNA', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Biology', 'Structural genomics', 'Structural biology'}"
gpt-4,"Newborns are frequently affected by mucocutaneous candidiasis. Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Biomedical science', 'Molecular genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Paediatrics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Omics', 'Molecular medicine', 'Human biology', 'DNA', 'Infectious disease', 'Human genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Immunology', 'Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural genomics'}"

To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence. Thus, the PAX6/DLX5-WNT5A axis governs the diffuse spread of glioma cells throughout the brain parenchyma, contributing to the lethality of GBM.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Genomics', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Proteogenomics', 'Medical informatics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Systems biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Epigenomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Pathology', 'Structural biology', 'Cell biology', 'Machine learning', 'Protein interactions', 'Multiomics', 'Data management', 'Oncology', 'Proteins', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Protein expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Translational medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gene structure', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Omics', 'Data visualisation', 'Human biology', 'DNA', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Neurobiology', 'Clinical data', 'Gene regulation', 'Human genetics', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Neurology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Biochemistry', 'Epigenetics', 'Structural genomics', 'Informatics'}"
gpt-4,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'DNA mutation', 'RNA', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Epigenomics', 'Molecular evolution', 'FAIR data', 'Data management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Structural genomics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Systems medicine', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Open science', 'Embryology', 'Genetic variation', 'Protein expression', 'Translational medicine', 'Bioengineering', 'Human genetics', 'Structural variation', 'Database management', 'Biology', 'Epigenetics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Mapping', 'Molecular biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Data acquisition', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Multiomics', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Gene structure', 'Quantitative genetics', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Neurobiology', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Structure prediction', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Immuno genetics', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Gene expression', 'Medical informatics', 'Function analysis', 'Nucleic acids', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biophysics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Animal study', 'Cell biology', 'Machine learning', 'Functional genomics', 'DNA mutation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'DNA', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Genetics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Rare diseases', 'Gene transcripts', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Structure analysis', 'Biomolecular simulation', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Informatics'}"

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

gpt-4,"Candida parapsilosis is a pathogenic fungus that is major cause of hospital-acquired infection, predominantly due to growth as biofilms on indwelling medical devices. It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Biomarkers', 'Genetics', 'Pathology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Systems biology', 'Computational biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Biomedical science', 'Microbiology', 'Data mining', 'Molecular genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Medical informatics', 'Proteomics', 'Protein variants', 'Molecular biology', 'Protein properties', 'Protein structure analysis', 'Transcriptomics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Data acquisition', 'Molecular evolution', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biophysics', 'Data analysis', 'Genetic variation', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Biotechnology', 'Protein targeting and localisation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Multiomics', 'Data management', 'Protein interactions', 'Molecular modelling', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Protein expression', 'Genomics', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Omics', 'Protein folds and structural domains', 'Data visualisation', 'Chemistry', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Structure prediction', 'Immunology', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Database management', 'Structure analysis', 'Biology', 'Protein modifications', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Informatics'}"

The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione.

gpt-4,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Chemical biology', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Systems biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Proteomics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Data acquisition', 'Comparative genomics', 'Metagenomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Geology', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Multiomics', 'Data management', 'Molecular modelling', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Functional genomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Omics', 'Data visualisation', 'Microbial ecology', 'Metabolomics', 'Chemistry', 'Natural language processing', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial collection', 'Gene regulation', 'Taxonomy', 'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Immunology', 'Database management', 'Biology', 'Synthetic biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Structural genomics', 'Informatics'}"

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Zoology', 'Genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene expression', 'Computational biology', 'Proteogenomics', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Systems biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Data mining', 'Drug discovery', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Medicine', 'Genetic variation', 'Personalised medicine', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Oncology', 'Functional genomics', 'Translational medicine', 'Genomics', 'Molecular medicine', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Pharmacology', 'RNA', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Informatics'}"
gpt-4,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Computational biology', 'Systems biology', 'Drug discovery', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Epigenomics', 'DNA binding sites', 'Molecular evolution', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Protein targeting and localisation', 'FAIR data', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data management', 'Model organisms', 'Immunomics', 'Molecular modelling', 'Genomics', 'Mobile genetic elements', 'Protein sites, features and motifs', 'Gene and protein families', 'Molecular medicine', 'Protein folds and structural domains', 'Human biology', 'Lipids', 'Metabolomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial collection', 'Infectious disease', 'Microfluidics', 'Gene regulation', 'Fluxomics', 'Molecular dynamics', 'Metabarcoding', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Structural genomics', 'Proteogenomics', 'Systems medicine', 'Protein variants', 'Microbiology', 'Data mining', 'Biomedical science', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Marine biology', 'Toxicology', 'Metagenomics', 'Nucleic acid structure analysis', 'Open science', 'Genetic variation', 'Embryology', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Protein interactions', 'Data quality management', 'Software engineering', 'Protein expression', 'Omics', 'Protein secondary structure', 'DNA polymorphism', 'Data visualisation', 'Antibiotics', 'Natural language processing', 'Drug development', 'Phylogenomics', 'Human genetics', 'Taxonomy', 'Structural variation', 'Immunology', 'Database management', 'DNA packaging', 'Biology', 'Genetic engineering', 'Epigenetics', 'Population genomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Mapping', 'Molecular biology', 'Data rescue', 'Developmental biology', 'Data acquisition', 'Medicine', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Structural biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Phenomics', 'Multiomics', 'Medicines research and development.', 'Protein folding, stability and design', 'Freshwater biology', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Laboratory information management', 'Quality affairs', 'Phylogenetics', 'Gene structure', 'Microbial ecology', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Population genetics', 'Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA', 'Structure prediction', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Sequence assembly', 'Epistasis', 'Data submission, annotation, and curation', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'NMR', 'Function analysis', 'Medical informatics', 'Protein structure analysis', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Protein properties', 'Enzymes', 'Nucleic acids', 'Sequence composition, complexity and repeats', 'Data governance', 'Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs', 'Comparative genomics', 'Personalised medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell biology', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Functional genomics', 'DNA mutation', 'Biodiversity', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sequence sites, features and motifs', 'DNA', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Genetics', 'RNA', 'Endocrinology and metabolism', 'Rare diseases', 'Gene transcripts', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Structure analysis', 'Data security', 'Immunogenetics', 'Protein modifications', 'Synthetic biology', 'Informatics'}"
