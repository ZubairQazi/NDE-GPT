Lassa Fever in Post-Conflict Sierra Leone,"Background

Lassa fever (LF), an often-fatal hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is a major public health threat in West Africa. When the violent civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991 to 2002) ended, an international consortium assisted in restoration of the LF program at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in an area with the world's highest incidence of the disease.

Methodology/Principal Findings

Clinical and laboratory records of patients presenting to the KGH Lassa Ward in the post-conflict period were organized electronically. Recombinant antigen-based LF immunoassays were used to assess LASV antigenemia and LASV-specific antibodies in patients who met criteria for suspected LF. KGH has been reestablished as a center for LF treatment and research, with over 500 suspected cases now presenting yearly. Higher case fatality rates (CFRs) in LF patients were observed compared to studies conducted prior to the civil conflict. Different criteria for defining LF stages and differences in sensitivity of assays likely account for these differences. The highest incidence of LF in Sierra Leone was observed during the dry season. LF cases were observed in ten of Sierra Leone's thirteen districts, with numerous cases from outside the traditional endemic zone. Deaths in patients presenting with LASV antigenemia were skewed towards individuals less than 29 years of age. Women self-reporting as pregnant were significantly overrepresented among LASV antigenemic patients. The CFR of ribavirin-treated patients presenting early in acute infection was lower than in untreated subjects.

Conclusions/Significance

Lassa fever remains a major public health threat in Sierra Leone. Outreach activities should expand because LF may be more widespread in Sierra Leone than previously recognized. Enhanced case finding to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment is imperative to reduce mortality. Even with ribavirin treatment, there was a high rate of fatalities underscoring the need to develop more effective and/or supplemental treatments for LF.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Tropical medicine', 'Public health and epidemiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

"Ontogeny of alveolar macrophages is a critical determinant of function during lung fibrosis [RNA-seq]
","Little is known about the relative importance of monocyte and tissue-resident macrophages in the development of lung fibrosis. We show that specific genetic deletion of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages after their recruitment to the lung ameliorated lung fibrosis, whereas tissue-resident alveolar macrophages did not contribute to fibrosis. Using transcriptomic profiling of flow-sorted cells, we found that monocyte to alveolar macrophage differentiation unfolds continuously over the course of fibrosis and its resolution. During the fibrotic phase, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages differ significantly from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages in their expression of profibrotic genes. A population of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages persisted in the lung for one year after the resolution of fibrosis, where they became increasingly similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Human homologues of profibrotic genes expressed by mouse monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages during fibrosis were up-regulated in human alveolar macrophages from fibrotic compared with normal lungs. Our findings suggest that selectively targeting alveolar macrophage differentiation within the lung may ameliorate fibrosis without the adverse consequences associated with global monocyte or tissue-resident alveolar macrophage depletion.

"Gut Microbiome Signatures are Predictive of Infectious Risk Following Induction Therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
","The majority of studies providing insights on the influence of the microbiome on the health of hematologic malignancy patients have concentrated on the transplant setting. In this investigation we examined microbiome characteristics from baseline until neutrophil recovery following induction chemotherapy (IC) in 97 acute myeloid leukemia patients. We aimed to assess the predictive capacity of the gastrointestinal microbiome and its relationship to clinical outcomes, with a specific focus on infection. At the start of IC, higher Shannon diversity (HR, 0.36; P=0.005) and higher relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (HR, 0.36; P=0.005) were associated with increased probability of remaining infection free during neutropenia. We determined baseline Shannon diversity values <2 had the best sensitivity, positive, and negative predictive value for infectious complications during neutropenia. Longitudinal analyses of microbiome trajectories from baseline until neutrophil recovery found greater decreases in stool Shannon diversity among subjects who developed an infection in the 90 days post neutrophil recovery (P = 0.003). Additionally, carbapenem receipt for >72hrs resulted in significantly lower α-diversity at neutrophil recovery (P=0.001) and was associated with increased incidence of infection in the 90 days following neutrophil recovery (HR, 4.55; P=0.002). Similarly, days on treatment antibiotics during IC was inversely correlated with Shannon diversity at the end of sampling (r=-0.40, P<0.001) and the cumulative incidence of infections in the 90 days post neutrophil recovery (HR, 1.04; P=0.002).

"Probiotic L. reuteri targeting C. difficile Infection
","Integration of antibiotic and probiotic therapy has the potential to lessen the public health burden to antimicrobial-associated diseases. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents an important example where rational design of next generation probiotics is being actively pursued to prevent disease recurrence. Because intrinsic resistance to clinically relevant CDI antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole, and fidaxomicin) is a desired trait in such probiotic species, we screened several bacteria and identified Lactobacillus reuteri as a promising candidate for adjunct therapy. Human-derived L. reuteri convert glycerol to the broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, reuterin. When supplemented with glycerol, strains carrying the pocR gene locus were potent reuterin producers with L. reuteri 17938 inhibiting C. difficile growth on a par with vancomycin. Targeted pocR mutations and complementation studies identified reuterin as the precursor-induced antimicrobial agent. Pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated when co-delivery of L. reuteri with glycerol was effective against C. difficile colonization in complex human fecal microbial communities, whereas treatment with either glycerol or L. reuteri alone was ineffective. Global unbiased microbiome and metabolomics analysis independently confirmed that glycerol precursor delivery with L. reuteri elicited changes in human microbial community composition and function that preferentially targets C. difficile outgrowth and toxicity, a finding consistent with glycerol fermentation and reuterin production. Antimicrobial resistance has thus been successfully exploited in the natural design of the human microbiome evasion of C. difficile and may provide a prototypic precursor-directed probiotic approach. Antibiotic resistance and substrate bioavailability may therefore represent critical new determinants for probiotic efficacy in clinical trials.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology'}",{'Probiotics'}

Influenza virus repurposes the antiviral protein IFIT2 to promote translation of viral mRNAs,"Cells infected by influenza virus mount a large-scale antiviral response and most cells ultimately initiate cell-death pathways in an attempt to suppress viral replication. We performed a CRISPR/Cas9-knockout selection designed to identify host factors required for replication following viral entry. We identified a large class of presumptive antiviral factors that unexpectedly act as important pro-viral enhancers during influenza virus infection. One of these, IFIT2, is an interferon-stimulated gene with well-established antiviral activity but limited mechanistic understanding. As opposed to suppressing infection, we show here that IFIT2 is instead repurposed by influenza virus to promote viral gene expression. CLIP‐seq demonstrated that IFIT2 binds directly to viral and cellular mRNAs in AU‐rich regions, with bound cellular transcripts enriched in interferon‐stimulated mRNAs. Polysome and ribosome profiling revealed that IFIT2 prevents ribosome pausing on bound mRNAs. Together, the data link IFIT2 binding to enhanced translational efficiency for viral and cellular mRNAs and ultimately viral replication. Our findings establish a model for the normal function of IFIT2 as a protein that increases translation of cellular mRNAs to support antiviral responses and explain how influenza virus uses this same activity to redirect a classically antiviral protein into a pro-viral effector.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Translational medicine', 'Virology'}",{'Host-Pathogen Interaction'}

","Stromal taxonomy consists of multiple cell subtypes that play a critical role in tissue repair or regeneration, fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis and tumor formation. However, their identities are not fully understood, as these conventional classified populations have historically been defined by restricted sets of markers. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate stromal mesenchymal cells (MCs) in normal and fibrotic mouse lung. Interrogated patterns of signature genes, lncRNAs, extracellular and plasma membrane genes, and top transcription factors expression were defined to characterize and classify 7 MC types in normal status. A specific new subset was discovered in fibrotic stage. Delineation of their differentiation trajectory was achieved by a machine learning method.

Changes in Microbial Ecology after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for recurrent C. difficile Infection Depends on Underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Gut microbiota play a key role in maintaining homeostasis in the human gut and alterations in the gut microbial ecosystem predispose to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and gut inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor can restore gut microbial diversity and pathogen colonization resistance and is being investigated for its ability to improve inflammatory gut conditions such as IBD. In this study, we investigated changes in gut microbiota following FMT in 38 patients with CDI with or without underlying IBD. Following FMT that successfully treated CDI, there was a significant change in gut microbial composition towards the donor microbiota and an overall increase in microbial diversity consistent with previous studies. FMT was successful in treating CDI using a diverse set of donors and varying degrees of donor stool engraftment suggesting donor type and degree of engraftment were not key for successful FMT treatment of CDI. However, in patients with underlying IBD, there was significantly lower expansion of new taxa and higher proportion of original community and more CDI relapses after FMT during a 24-month follow up. Moreover, the need for therapy for IBD did not change following FMT. These results suggest that changes in gut microbial landscape may be important for long term success of CDI treatment in patients with underlying IBD and potentially for improvement of underlying pathophysiology in IBD.

Microbiota dynamics in patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis and is responsible for a large and increasing fraction of hospital-acquired infections. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as an alternative treatment option for recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI) has recently been discussed favorably in the clinical and scientific communities and is receiving increasing public attention. However, short- and long-term health consequences of FMT remain a concern, as the effects of the transplanted microbiota on the patient remain unknown. While patients are generally reported to be free of RCDI-associated symptoms within a few days after FMT, they remain susceptible to relapse after additional antibiotic treatment. To shed light on associated microbial events, we performed fecal microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing of 14 pairs of healthy donors and RCDI patients treated successfully by FMT. Simultaneous longitudinal sampling of post-FMT patients and healthy donors until up to one year after FMT, including one post-FMT patient who experienced a relapse after antibiotic treatment, allowed us not only to confirm prior reports that RCDI is associated with reduced diversity and compositional changes in the fecal microbiota, but also to characterize previously undocumented post-FMT microbiota dynamics. The taxonomic groups found increased in individual RCDI patient samples differed when compared to healthy patient samples, and included Streptococcaceae, Enterococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae. Bacteria predicted to be involved in butyrate production (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae) were almost uniformly reduced in RCDI patients. Interestingly, the fecal RCDI sample from the relapsing post-FMT patient showed similarities to healthy donor samples, suggesting that the microbiota phenotypes described in other RCDI patients are not sufficient to explain the disease. Moreover, overall microbiota compositions and specifically abundances of the above-mentioned Firmicutes, continued to change in asymptomatic patients for at least 16 weeks after FMT, potentially explaining the increased risk for relapse in post-FMT RCDI patients.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",{'Microbiota'}

To develop a TB model that more closely resembles human disease, we infected mice with an ultra-low dose (ULD) of between 1-3 founding bacteria, reflecting a physiologic inoculum. ULD-infected mice exhibited highly heterogeneous bacterial burdens, well-circumscribed granulomas that shared features with human granulomas, and prolonged Mtb containment with unilateral pulmonary infection in some mice. We identified blood RNA signatures in mice infected with an ULD or a conventional Mtb dose (50-100 CFU) that correlated with lung bacterial burdens and predicted Mtb infection outcomes across species, including risk of progression to active TB in humans.

In 2009, infections with a novel H1N1 strain resulted in 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,470 deaths. Risk factors for morbidity and mortality include age, co-morbid illness–such as diabetes mellitus–and lower respiratory tract disease. In both human studies and pre-clinical animal models, several biomarkers have been associated with more severe disease. Preliminary studies show that the nasal and lower respiratory tract epithelial cells express receptors for cytokines associated with cell death that turn on specific signaling pathways and induce a unique transcriptome pattern within these cells. Thus, the epithelial transcriptome can be used to mine and understand which signals the epithelium is receiving from mucosal-associated lymphoid cells that are critical in driving influenza pathology. Based on these studies, we predict that epithelial transcriptomics can be used to model influenza severity in a predictive fashion.

MHC class II proteins mediate cross-species entry of bat influenza viruses,"Zoonotic influenza A viruses of avian origin can cause severe disease in individuals, or even global pandemics, and thus pose a threat to human populations. Waterfowl and shorebirds are believed to be the reservoir for all influenza A viruses, but this has recently been challenged by the identification of novel influenza A viruses in bats. The major bat influenza A virus envelope glycoprotein, haemagglutinin, does not bind the canonical influenza A virus receptor, sialic acid or any other glycan, despite its high sequence and structural homology with conventional haemagglutinins. This functionally uncharacterized plasticity of the bat influenza A virus haemagglutinin means the tropism and zoonotic potential of these viruses has not been fully determined. Here we show, using transcriptomic profiling of susceptible versus non-susceptible cells in combination with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, that the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR) is an essential entry determinant for bat influenza A viruses. Genetic ablation of the HLA-DR α-chain rendered cells resistant to infection by bat influenza A virus, whereas ectopic expression of the HLA-DR complex in non-susceptible cells conferred susceptibility. Expression of MHC-II from different bat species, pigs, mice or chickens also conferred susceptibility to infection. Notably, the infection of mice with bat influenza A virus resulted in robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, whereas mice deficient for MHC-II were resistant. Collectively, our data identify MHC-II as a crucial entry mediator for bat influenza A viruses in multiple species, which permits a broad vertebrate tropism.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Zoology', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

Sequencing short capped RNAs captures acute transcription initiation and identifies promoter and distal regulatory elements across eukaryotes from total RNA,"The spatial and temporal regulation of transcription initiation is pivotal for controlling gene expression. Here, we introduce capped-small RNA-seq (csRNA-seq), which uses total RNA as starting material to detect transcription start sites (TSS) of both stable and unstable RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution. csRNA-seq is highly sensitive to acute changes in transcription and identifies an order of magnitude more regulated transcripts than RNA-seq. Interrogating tissues from species across the eukaryotic kingdoms identified unstable transcripts resembling enhancer RNAs, pre-miRNAs, antisense transcripts and promoter upstream transcripts in multicellular animals, plants and fungi spanning 1.6 million years of evolution. Integration of epigenomic data from these organisms revealed that histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) was largely confined to TSS of stable transcripts, while H3K27ac marked nucleosomes downstream of all active TSS, suggesting an ancient role for post-translational histone modifications in transcription.

Viral determinants in H5N1 influenza A virus enable productive infection of HeLa cells,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a human respiratory pathogen that causes yearly global epidemics, and sporadic pandemics due to human adaptation of pathogenic strains. Efficient replication of IAV in different species is, in part, dictated by its ability to exploit the genetic environment of the host cell. To investigate IAV tropism in human cells, we evaluated the replication of IAV strains in a diverse subset of epithelial cell lines. HeLa cells were refractory to growth of human H1N1 and H3N2, and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAIs) viruses. Interestingly, a human isolate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 successfully propagated in HeLa cells to levels comparable to a human lung cell line. Heterokaryon cells generated by fusion of HeLa and permissive cells supported H1N1 growth, suggesting the absence of a host factor(s) required for replication of H1N1, but not H5N1, in HeLa cells. The absence of this factor(s) was mapped to reduced nuclear import, replication, and translation, and deficient viral budding. Using reassortant H1N1:H5N1 viruses, we found that the combined introduction of nucleoprotein (NP) and hemagglutinin (HA) from H5N1 was necessary and sufficient to enable H1N1 growth. Overall, this study suggests the absence of one or more cellular factors in HeLa cells that results in abortive replication of H1N1, H3N2, and LPAI viruses, but can be circumvented upon introduction of H5N1 NP and HA. Further understanding of the molecular basis of this restriction will provide important insights into virus-host interactions that underlie IAV pathogenesis and tropism.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Tropical medicine', 'Immunology', 'Virology'}",set()

Fecal microbial dynamics during recurrent and nonrecurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains problematic, with up to 30% of individuals diagnosed with primary CDI experiencing at least one episode of recurrence. Microbial therapeutics, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, have been successful in treating patients, increasing the relative proportion of ‘healthy’ microbes. However, few studies have looked at what predisposes patients to recurrent disease initially. Our study investigated the fecal microbiota community over time in patients diagnosed with CDI. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we sought to compare microbial changes over time in patients with or without recurrence and to identify microbial signatures that may correlate to the development of recurrence. We observed a trend towards lower diversity in samples collected from patients with recurrent disease over time. Although microbial community structure was similar between samples from recurrent and nonrecurrent patients, we observed a significantly different community structure between samples that tested positive or negative for C. difficile. Interestingly, patients with more severe disease had a lower diversity compared to healthier patients. To date, this study represents one of the largest studies focused on microbial signatures that may predispose individuals to recurrent CDI.

MadR transcriptional regulation of mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a complex cell envelope that is remodelled throughout infection to respond and survive the hostile and variable intracellular conditions within the host. Despite the importance of cell wall homeostasis in pathogenicity, little is known about the environmental signals and regulatory networks controlling cell wall biogenesis in mycobacteria. The mycolic acid desaturase regulator (MadR) is a transcriptional repressor responsible for regulation of the essential aerobic desaturases desA1 and desA2 that are differentially regulated throughout infection along with mycolate modification genes and thus, likely involved in mycolic acid remodelling. Here we generated a madR null mutant in M. smegmatis that exhibited traits of an impaired cell wall with increased permeability, susceptibility to rifampicin and cell surface disruption as a consequence of desA1/desA2 dysregulation. Analysis of mycolic acids revealed the presence of a highly desaturated mycolate in the null mutant that exists in relative trace amounts in the wildtype, but increases in abundance upon cell surface disruption as a result of relieved repression on the desA1/desA2 promoters. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed MadR as a cell surface disruption responsive regulator of desA1/desA2 and further implicating it in the control of bespoke β-oxidation pathways and transport evolutionarily diversified subnetworks associated with virulence. In vitro characterisation of MadR using electromobility shift assays and analysis of binding affinities is suggestive of a unique acyl-CoA pool sensing mechanism, whereby MadR is able to bind a range of acyl-CoA but MadR repression of desA1/desA2 promoters is only relieved upon binding of saturated acyl-CoA of chain length C16-C24. We propose this acyl effector ligand mechanism as distinct to other regulators of mycolic acid biosynthesis or fatty acid desaturases and places MadR as the key regulatory checkpoint that coordinates mycolic acid remodelling in response to host derived cell surface perturbation",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites'}",set()

","How transcription affects genome organization in the nucleus is poorly understood. Analyzing influenza A virus (IAV)-infected human macrophages, we observe rapid reorganization of chromatin interactions. These changes occur where IAV NS1 protein-induced global inhibition of transcription termination leads to read-through transcription for hundreds of kilobases past the ends of highly transcribed genes. In these read-through regions, RNA polymerase II induces cohesin displacement from CTCF sites at loop anchors, leading to disrupted chromatin interactions and decompaction. Conversely, transcription elongation inhibition allows cohesin to accumulate at previously transcribed CTCF sites and to mediate chromatin looping and compaction. Data from non-viral stimuli indicates that transcription generally regulates cohesin and genome organization within gene bodies. Additionally, transcription into heterochromatin regions switches them from the inert (B) to the permissive (A) chromatin compartment and enables transcription factor binding.

MTB avoids immune effectors and antibacterial killing by entering into distinct physiological states. The surviving cells, persisters, are a major barrier to the timely and relapse-free treatment of tuberculosis (TB). We present for the first time, PerSort, a method to isolate and characterize persisters in the absence of antibiotic, or other pressure. We demonstrate the value of PerSort to isolate translationally dormant cells that pre-exist in small numbers within Mycobacterium spp. cultures growing under optimal conditions, but which dramatically increased in proportion under stress conditions. The translationally dormant subpopulation exhibited multidrug tolerance and regrowth properties consistent with persister cells. Furthermore, PerSort enabled single-cell transcriptional profiling that provided evidence that the translationally dormant persisters were generated through a variety of mechanisms, including vapC30, mazF, and relA/spoT overexpression. Finally, we demonstrate that notwithstanding the varied mechanisms by which the persister cells were generated, they converge on a similar low oxygen metabolic state that was reversed through activation of respiration to rapidly eliminate persisters fostered under host-relevant stress conditions. We conclude that PerSort provides a new tool to study MTB persisters, enabling targeted strategies to improve and shorten the treatment of TB.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
"Parallel evolution of tobramycin resistance across species and environments
","An important problem in evolution is identifying the genetic basis of how different species adapt to similar environments. Understanding how diverse bacterial pathogens evolve in response to an antimicrobial treatment is a pressing example of this problem, where discovery of molecular parallelism could lead to clinically useful predictions. Evolution experiments with pathogens in environments containing antibiotics, combined with periodic whole population genome sequencing, can be used to identify many contending routes to antimicrobial resistance. We separately propagated two clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, in increasing concentrations of tobramycin in two different environments each: planktonic and biofilm. Independent of the pathogen, populations adapted to tobramycin selection by parallel evolution of mutations in fusA1, encoding elongation factor G, and ptsP, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase. As neither gene is a direct target of this aminoglycoside, both are unexpected and underreported causes of resistance. Additionally, both species acquired antibiotic-associated mutations that were more prevalent in the biofilm lifestyle than planktonic, in electron transport chain components in A. baumannii and LPS biosynthesis enzymes in P. aeruginosa populations. Using existing databases, we discovered both fusA1 and ptsP mutations to be prevalent in antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. Additionally, we report site-specific parallelism of fusA1 mutations that extend across several bacterial phyla. This study suggests that strong selective pressures such as antibiotic treatment may result in high levels of predictability in molecular targets of evolution despite differences between organism's genetic background and environment.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology'}",set()

A Genome-Wide CRISPR-Cas9 Screen Reveals the Requirement of Host Cell Sulfation for Schmallenberg Virus Infection,"Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an insect-transmitted orthobunyavirus that can cause abortions and congenital malformations in the offspring of ruminants. Even though the two viral surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc are involved in host cell entry, the specific cellular receptors of SBV are currently unknown. Using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 forward screening, we identified 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) transporter 1 (PAPST1) as an essential factor for SBV infection. PAPST1 is a sulfotransferase involved in heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis encoded by the solute carrier family 35 member B2 gene (SLC35B2). SBV cell surface attachment and entry were largely reduced upon the knockout of SLC35B2, whereas the reconstitution of SLC35B2 in these cells fully restored their susceptibility to SBV infection. Furthermore, treatment of cells with heparinase diminished infection with SBV, confirming that heparan sulfate plays an important role in cell attachment and entry, although to various degrees, heparan sulfate was also found to be important to initiate infection by two other bunyaviruses, La Crosse virus and Rift Valley fever virus. Thus, PAPST1-triggered synthesis of cell surface heparan sulfate is required for the efficient replication of SBV and other bunyaviruses.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Molecular medicine', 'Molecular biology'}",set()

"Circuits between infected macrophages and T cells in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
","Some patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 88 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 211 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on 10 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the alveolar space was persistently enriched in T cells and monocytes. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic profiling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages, which in turn respond by producing T cell chemoattractants. These T cells produce interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell activation. Collectively, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly-unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives persistent alveolar inflammation.

"The Aging Microenvironment Drives Alveolar Macrophage Changes in Aging [RNA-Seq]
","Our study shows that the aging lung microenvironment shapes the transcriptional phenotype of alveolar macrophages during aging. Except during acute injury when alveolar macrophage differentiation is incomplete, cellular ontogeny makes little difference in determining the transcriptional response of alveolar macrophages. Studies with parabiosis suggest the age-related changes in the alveolar microenvironment occur independently of circulating factors or cells. Our findings suggest that changes that target the microenvironment, for example metformin, senolytics or others might indirectly improve macrophage function during aging.

","The human helicase senataxin (SETX) has been linked to the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4) and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA2). Here we identified a role for SETX in controlling the antiviral response. Cells that had undergone depletion of SETX and SETX-deficient cells derived from patients with AOA2 had higher expression of antiviral mediators in response to infection than did wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we propose a model whereby SETX attenuates the activity of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at genes stimulated after a virus is sensed and thus controls the magnitude of the host response to pathogens and the biogenesis of various RNA viruses (e.g., influenza A virus and West Nile virus).

Existence of human-virus chimeric proteins generated during infection,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a threat to mankind because it generates yearly epidemics and poorly predictable sporadic pandemics with catastrophic potential. Influenza has a small RNA genome (~14 Kb) composed of 8 mini-chromosomes (segments). Segments encode both structural proteins and proteins expressed only during infection. Segments are constituted by a 5’UTR followed by a coding region and a 3’UTR. Transcription of IAV RNA into mRNA depends on host RNA Polymerase II, as the viral polymerase cleaves 5’ capped cellular nascent transcripts to be used as primers to initiate mRNA synthesis. We hypothesized that host nascent transcripts bearing AUG could generate upstream ORFs in the viral segments, a phenomenon that would depend on the translatability of the viral 5’UTRs. Using orthogonal datasets we report the existence of this mechanism, which generate host-virus chimeric proteins. We show that most segments encode proteins in this manner, expanding the proteome diversity of IAV in infected cells. Host-virus chimeric proteins are conserved across IAV strains, pointing to an evolutionary conservation of function achieved by sampling of the evolutionary space before gene fixation. Thus, we discover a mechanism that generate human-virus chimeric proteins during infection.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioinformatics', 'Computational biology', 'Virology'}",set()

Fecal microbial dynamics during recurrent and nonrecurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains problematic, with up to 30% of individuals diagnosed with primary CDI experiencing at least one episode of recurrence. Microbial therapeutics, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, have been successful in treating patients, increasing the relative proportion of ‘healthy’ microbes. However, few studies have looked at what predisposes patients to recurrent disease initially. Our study investigated the fecal microbiota community over time in patients diagnosed with CDI. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we sought to compare microbial changes over time in patients with or without recurrence and to identify microbial signatures that may correlate to the development of recurrence. We observed a trend towards lower diversity in samples collected from patients with recurrent disease over time. Although microbial community structure was similar between samples from recurrent and nonrecurrent patients, we observed a significantly different community structure between samples that tested positive or negative for C. difficile. Interestingly, patients with more severe disease had a lower diversity compared to healthier patients. To date, this study represents one of the largest studies focused on microbial signatures that may predispose individuals to recurrent CDI. Knowledge about microbial signatures that correlate with susceptibility to recurrent disease may lead to better treatment methods at initial CDI diagnosis.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

Dynamic changes in short- and long-term bacterial composition following fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that often fails standard antibiotic therapy. Despite its widespread recent use, however, little is known about the stability of the fecal microbiota following FMT. Results: Here we report on short- and long-term changes and provide kinetic visualization of fecal microbiota composition in patients with multiply recurrent CDI that were refractory to antibiotic therapy and treated using FMT. Fecal samples were collected from four patients before and up to 151 days after FMT, with daily collections until 28 days and weekly collections until 84 days post-FMT. The composition of fecal bacteria was characterized using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, compared to microbiota across body sites in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) database, and visualized in a movie-like, kinetic format. FMT resulted in rapid normalization of bacterial fecal sample composition from a markedly dysbiotic state to one representative of normal fecal microbiota. While the microbiome appeared most similar to the donor implant material 1 day post-FMT, the composition diverged variably at later time points. The donor microbiota composition also varied over time. However, both post-FMT and donor samples remained within the larger cloud of fecal microbiota characterized as healthy by the HMP. Conclusions: Dynamic behavior is an intrinsic property of normal fecal microbiota and should be accounted for in comparing microbial communities among normal individuals and those with disease states. This also suggests that more frequent sample analyses are needed in order to properly assess success of FMT procedures",gpt-3.5-turbo,{'Infectious disease'},{'Microbiology  Metagenomics'}
