M. tuberculosis oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor,"Identification of oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors in M. smegmatis
Purpose
Survival of M. tuberculosis is dependent on the existence of an energized plasma membrane, which couples nutrient oxidation to ATP synthesis via the production of an electrochemical gradient. This assay seeks to identify compounds that inhibit this process, also known as oxidative phosphorylation, utilizing inverted membrane vesicles from M. smegmatis, to assess the production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation upon the addition of NADH. The NADH is then oxidized through a cascade of redox reactions, resulting in the formation of a proton gradient across the vesicle membrane. This proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by the F1F0 ATP synthase.
Protocol
Compounds are dry-spotted into 384-well microtiter plates at a screening concentration of 10 uM. After compound addition, M. smegmatis inverted membrane vesicles were preincubated with compound for 30 min in a buffer consisting of 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM KH2P04. Then, 3 uL of NADH and ATP were added, at final concentrations of 2 mM and 100 uM, respectively, and incubated for 30 min. Finally, 2 mL of a 1:4 dilution (in PBS) of BacTiter-Glo was added to the plate and incubated for 5 min before measuring luminescence as a readout of ATP production on a ViewLux or Envision plate reader.

TB Intramacrophage Assay,"Full deck screen to identify novel compounds that inhibit intracellular M. tuberculosis via inducible fluoresence assay in the absence of INH. Compounds are also assayed for potentiation with known tuberculosis drugs by adding sub-therapeutic levels to the assay media.
Purpose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents an immense global public health problem, which has been exacerbated by the emergence of strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. This assay seeks to identify novel small molecules that restrict the growth of intracellular M. tuberculosis through a collaboration with the David Russell Laboratory at Cornell University.
Protocol
Macrophages (J774 cells from American Type Culture Collection) are seeded into 384-well black clear bottom plates. M. tuberculosis (Erdman(P606’::mKO-tetON)) is grown to mid-log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 OADC washed and syringed 6-times with 25G? tuberculin syringe. The de-clumped bacteria are diluted into pre-warmed infection media (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2.0 mM L-glutamine, and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate) and are used to infect cells at a MOI of 4:1. Bacteria are added to the screening plates with a Janus Ministation (Perkin Elmer). Compound plates are prepared at Calibr with DMSO as a negative control and Rifampicin as a positive control. Before addition to cells, compounds are diluted in DMEM (no FBS) and are added to the screening plates 1 hour after infection to a final top concentration of 20 ?M. Plates are incubated for a total of 6 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. On day 4, 10 ?l of 1.4 ?g/mL anhydrotetracycline (ATc) was added per well (final concentration 200 ng/mL). Plates are returned to the incubator for an additional 2 days. On day 6 (48 h post-induction), Mtb mKO fluorescence is quantified using an Envision Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Crypto-C. parvum high-content imaging proliferation (Sterling Lab),"Phenotypic high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen against the protozoan pathogen C. parvum to find new small molecule inhibitors of Cryptosporidium, which causes diarrheal disease in humans.
Purpose
Cryptosporidium parvum and the related species Cryptosporidium hominis cause diarrheal disease in humans. The current standard of care is ineffective in patients most at risk of cryptosporidiosis. This is a phenotypic high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen against the protozoan pathogen C. parvum to find new small molecule inhibitors of Cryptosporidium. This is the largest screen against Cryptosporidium and one of the few in a 1536-well format. The assay measures inhibition of parasite proliferation within the human ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-8; a commonly used cell line for studying Cryptosporidium spp. in vitro. HCI detection of this cell-based assay allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity.
Protocol
This specific ID is for the Sterling Parasitology Lab strain of C. parvum (IOWA strain), which has been routinely passaged through neonatal calves to propagate. For the assay, HCT-8 cells are seeded into 1536-well clear-bottom plates and incubated at 37C. 24 hours later, compounds are transferred (1.88 uM for primary screening and 25 uM top concentration for dose-response), and then excysted Cryptosporidium sporozoites and oocysts are dispensed onto cells. 48 hours later, cells are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells are then washed, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with SuperBlock (Thermo), and finally stained with a 1:10 dilution of Superblock with 1ug/mL FITC-tagged Vicia Villosa lectin and 3uM DAPI nuclear stain. Cells are then washed with PBS-T to remove residual stain and plates are sealed with aluminum adhesive seals. Plates are imaged (10x objective) on the CX5 Cellomics imager using the SpotDetector algorithm. Compounds that inhibit Cryptosporidium proliferation by >= 70% and do not inhibit HCT-8 growth by more than 40% are picked for dose response testing.

Dual fluorescence reporter based intracellular nonreplicating MTB screen,"Phenotypic high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen against the intracellular nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a dual fluorescence reporter-based system.
Purpose
In order to more closely recapitulate human tuberculosis disease, intramacrophage screens may be more useful than assays with only extracellular bacteria. We have developed a dual fluorescence reporter-based assay with intracellular nonreplicating MTB. Compounds that are active against replicating MTB are not active in this assay. Green fluorescence indicates the presence of MTB; red fluorescence indicates viable MTB; Hoechst staining is nuclear staining of macrophage host cells. This assay is to screen for compounds that kill nonreplicating MTB directly, or indirectly by enhancing host cell defense mechanisms.
Protocol
J774 macrophage cells are infected with M. tuberculosis H37RvDK (‚àÜPan, ‚àÜRD1) at a MOI of 5:1. Infected cells are seeded (5000 cells/well; 6 uL/well) in clear-bottom 1536-well plates and incubated at 37C for 12 hours. After incubation, the medium is replaced with 6 uL of fresh cell culture medium. Compounds are then dispensed into assay plates and incubated at 37C for 48 hours. After incubation period, 2 uL of inducer is added to each well (150 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline) and the plates are incubated at 37C overnight. The next day, medium is replaced with 6 uL of fresh 1X PBS containing 1 ug/ml Hoechst 33342. Plates are then sealed with aluminum adhesive seals and scanned on the Thermo CX5 Cellomics imager using the SpotDetector algorithm within 24 hours (live cell imaging, time sensitive).

STING agonist,"Identification of mouse cross-reactive STING agonists
Purpose
To screen for STING agonist using a IFIT2 reporter RAW264.7 cell-line. DMXAA is currently the only non-nucleotide STING agonist in literature but failed to exert activity in human cells. Any valid screen hit may become the first-in-class tool compound. IFIT2 is a downstream gene of type I interferon, and therefore STING agonist should increase the expression of both IFIT2 and luciferase. The reporter is a secreted luciferase and is smaller than Gaussia.
Protocol
Dry echo dispense 10uM compound into 1536w white plates. Dry echo dispense 30uM DMXAA (positive control) into bottom half of column 46. Dispense the cells (5uL, 1.2x10^6 cells per mL) (Invigoen #rawl-isg) and incubate at 37C for 24h. Dispense the reading reagent (2uL, 1x, Quanti-Luc, Invivogen #rep-qlc2). Read in 5min.

Wolbachia high-content imaging,"High content imaging, cell-based assay has been developed to identify compounds that reduce Wolbachia titer in host cells. Wolbachia is an endosymbiont of parasitic filarial nematodes, including ones that infect humans (like river blindness, elephantiasis)
Purpose
This high content imaging, cell-based assay has been developed to identify anti-wolbachial compounds. Wolbachia is an endosymbiont of parasitic filarial nematodes, including ones that infect humans, such as Onchocerca volvulus (which causes onchocerciasis, aka. river blindness), and Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp. (which cause lymphatic filariasis, aka. elephantiasis). Without Wolbachia the long-lived (up to 15 years) adult worms become sterile and eventually die. Wolbachia bacteria also infect insect cells, and this assay uses the LDW1 Drosophila cell line, naturally infected with Wolbachia strain wMel. This is the first HCI assay to specifically label Wolbachia, one of the largest screening efforts to date, and the first anti-wolbachial assays in 1536-well format.
Protocol
Clear bottom 1536-well plates are coated with Concanavalin-A lectin to facilitate cell adhesion. Compounds are pre-spotted into coated plates (2.5 uM for primary screen and 12.5 uM top concentration for dose-response) and LDW1 cells are dispensed into prepared plates. Doxycycline and rifampicin are used as inhibitory controls and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control.

Discovery of sporontocidals compounds as starting points for novel malaria causal prophylactics,"Identification of compounds that target P. falciparum sporozoites through a luminescent viability assay
Purpose
A transgenic P. falciparum reporter parasite was created by inserting a GFP::luc reporter gene under control of the circumsporozoite promoter in the Pf47 locus. These parasites show strong reporter expression in developing and mature sporozoites. To assess the effects of compounds on viability of sporozoite, salivary gland sporozoites were isolated from infected mosquitoes and incubated with test substance in microtiter plates. Twenty-four hours later, luciferase activity was determined as a measure for parasite viability.




Protocol
Fourteen to twenty-two days post infection with NF54-CGL, salivary glands of infected mosquitoes were isolated in L-15 (Leibovitz) medium (Lonza) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and L-glutamine and ground in a glass mortar to free the sporozoites. After determining the sporozoite count with a hematocytometer, sporozoites were diluted to the desired concentration with L-15 medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and L-glutamine without (‚Äúincomplete medium‚Äù) or with (‚Äúcomplete medium‚Äù) 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (hi-FBS). For the screenings, 12 ¬µL/well of a 25,000 to 83,000 sporozoite/mL dilution (corresponding to 300-1,000 sporozoites/well) were dispensed using a Multidrop (Thermofisher) or an electronic multichannel (Ovation) in white 384-well plates (Proxiplate 384-TC Perkin Elmer) pre-spotted with the chemical library. For assay development, test of antimalarial drugs and for compounds issued from resynthesis, 6 ¬µL of a 167,000 sporozoite/mL dilution (corresponding to 1,000 sporozoites/well) were dispensed using an electronic multichannel in white 384-well plates containing 6 ¬µL of compounds diluted at two-fold the final concentration in incomplete or complete medium. In all cases, the compounds had been dissolved in DMSO, and the final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1%. Each plate contained vehicle (0.1% DMSO) and positive (100 nM to 1 ¬µM gramicidin) controls, which were used for normalization of the signals. The plates were incubated at 26¬?C with ambient gas in a humidity-controlled incubator for 24 hours, then 6 ¬µL of Bright Glo reagent (Promega) was added to the wells. After a three minute incubation, luciferase activity was measured using a Synergy 2 multi-purpose plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).

Tuberculosis tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor,"Identification of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors of M. tuberculosis via luminescence assay
Purpose
Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase that catalyzes tyrosine to its corresponding tRNA during protein synthesis. Aminoacylation occurs in two steps: 1. Amino Acid + ATP ‚Üí Aminoacyl-AMP + PPi; 2. Aminoacyl-AMP + tRNA ‚Üí Aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP. Identifying inhibitors of TyrRS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis could disrupt the protein synthesis process and prevent growth. Since bacteria and human TyrRS are unique, it serves as potential target as antimicrobial agents. This 1536 well assay identifies inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis TyrRS by monitoring the depletion of ATP in the first step of the reaction using Kinase Glo. Because the luminescent signal is dependent on ATP, an increase in signal corresponds to the inhibition of TyrRS.
Protocol
Compounds and controls are pre-spotted onto white 1536 well microtiter plate at 10uM for primary screen and 100uM top concentration for dose response. 2uL of the enzyme buffer (100nM of Mtb TyrRS enzyme, 2 unit/mL of Inorganic E. Coli Pyrophosphatase from Sigma, and 0.1 mg/mL of BSA) is dispensed following 40 minute incubation. 1uL of substrate buffer (5uM of L-Tyrosine from Sigma, 1mg/mL of Mtb E.coli MRE 600 tRNA from Sigma, 1uM of ATP from Thermo Fisher) is then dispensed and is incubated for 4 hours. 3uL of Kinase Glo Detection is added and luminescence is read after 10 minute incubation on Perkin Elmer Viewlux Imager.

Intramacrophage Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"A high content microscopy assay to determine drug activity against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Purpose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, exists in a complex set of environments both intracellularly and extracellularly in the host. Most drug screening for tuberculosis has been performed on extracellular bacteria. We are screening for drugs that inhibit M. tuberculosis growth inside macrophages, a primary cell type in which the bacteria reside. This is a high-content image-based assay. Total fluorescence intensity of DsRed-producing M. tuberculosis and nucleic acid-stained macrophages are readouts of growth or survival.
Protocol
RAW 264.7 cells are propagated in RMPI ( RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2 mM Glutagro, 1 mM sodium pyruvate medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 37°C, 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells are infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Rv DREAM8 strain which constitutively expresses DsRed) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 overnight. Compounds are diluted in RPMI-1640, 5% FBS with Glutagro and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Infected RAW 264.7 cells are harvested with Accumax solution, washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacilli and resuspended in RPMI-1640 with Glutagro and sodium pyruvate (no FBS). Infected cells are  seeded in 384-well plates containing compounds at 3.3 x 10^3 cells per well, resulting in a final assay concentration of 2.5% FBS. After a 72 hour incubation period, SYBR Green I dye is diluted in PBS and added to a final concentration of 5x to stain macrophage nuclei. Cells are imaged on an ImageXpress Micro with a 4x objective. Macrophage nuclei are imaged using a FITC filter set and M. tuberculosis are imaged using a Texas Red filter set. This method has been published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303619?via%3Dihub

TB Deconstructed Granuloma,"Screening of ReFRAME library +/- isoniazid (INH) for synergistic activity against tetracycline-inducible mKO fluorescent reporter strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Erdman) in the deconstructed granuloma model (DGr).
Purpose
High through-put assaying of ReFRAME library for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the deconstructed granuloma model (DGr) in the presence of INH. To maximize the richness of a screen for compounds that impact progression of Mtb growth through host-directed targets we have developed a screen based on including all the cells present in active murine tuberculosis granulomas. 
Protocol
In brief, mice are infected with mCherry-expressing Mtb Erdman (103 organisms intranasally) and left for 21 days. At this time point the immune response is in transition. The innate response is still active and the acquired response is developing.  In addition, this is the time of highest bacterial burden.  We hypothesize that this is an ideal time-point because the infection is at its most plastic and all cell types that could impact disease progression (both positively and negatively) are present. To provide a comparison against this assay with the cell type we have utilized before, we have run this with J774 cells in parallel to the DGr-ReFrame. At 21 days the mice are sacrificed and the lungs excised. The tissue is broken down by homogenization and digestion with a cocktail of enzymes including collagenase and DNase1. Large fibrous aggregates are removed by centrifugation and the single cell suspension washed. An aliquot of the suspension is fixed for analysis by flow cytometry. The remainder is seeded into 384 well plates @ 100,000 cells/well (30uL), infected with a second Mtb strain, this time carrying the tetracycline inducible mKO protein (10uL @ 0.2 OD600). The plates are given either DMEM or DMEM with sub-MIC INH (0.0125ug/mL), and the test drug compounds (5uM in 10uL) in parallel. The plates are incubated, and 10uL ATc (final conc. 200ng/mL) is added at day 4 and read by fluorescent plate reader on day 6 and 7 to measure the signal from growing/surviving bacteria. At the conclusion of incubation the gain in signal is calculated by the median measurement across the plate.

MAVS Aggregation Assay,"The identification of a MAVS agonist using an image-based, high content assay.
Purpose
Activation of MAVS is one of the subsequent and central steps in the RIG-I pathway following the binding of dsRNA by MDA5 or RIG-I. The assay will detect compounds that can cause fluorescent fusion protein, Clover-MAVS, to aggregate within HEK293T stable line. Additional secondary assays will confirm if there is full pathway activation which would be equivalent through activation of the innate immune system.

Acinetobacter (1536w) 24h BTG Meropenem Potentiation - HUMC1 serum,"Viability assay for virulent XDR Acinetobacter baumannii strain HUMC1
Purpose
A. baumannii infections, such as nosocomial pneumonia and bacteremia, are a serious public concern, with drug resistant isolates a significant problem for treatment. Carbapenems, such as meropenem, are important therapeutic options for these infections, but resistant isolates have increasingly been reported. This is an assay to identify potentiators of meropenem antibiotic activity towards the carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii HUMC1 strain, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR), highly virulent clinical bloodstream isolate. HUMC1 has been well characterized in mouse models of infection by the Sternberg lab (USC), facilitating follow up of screen hits in vivo. This screen is carried out in defined cell culture medium, mimicking in vivo growth conditions of the bacteria during infection.
Protocol
Compounds are acoustically transferred via Echo into 1536-well white plates (20 uM for primary screen and 40 uM top concentration for dose-response, with 10 uM of meropenem throughout). Overnight cultures of bacteria are subcultured, diluted in assay media (a defined cell culture medium with high concentration of normal mouse serum), and dispensed into plates. Following a 24 hour incubation with compounds of interest, BacTiter-Glo Luminescent Microbial Cell Viability Assay is used to measure bacterial viability.

"Calibr ReFrame Library Screen against, Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243","Host-directed phenotypic screen to identify small molecule therapeutics that regulate intracellular B. pseudomallei bacterial infection
Purpose
RAW264.7 murine macrophages seeded in 384 well plates are pre-treated with the compounds from the Calibr Reframe library for two hours and then infected with B. pseudomallei (1 MOI). After four hours post –infection, kanamycin (500 µg/ml) is added to kill extracellular bacteria. After eight hours post infection, cells are fixed, washed, stained with appropriate bacteria specific primary antibody and fluorescent tagged secondary antibody and images are acquired using the Opera imaging system.  The acapella software is then used to detect and quantify internalized and cell associated bacteria and mammalian cells. To determine percent of bacterial infection inhibition and cytotoxicity, the Acapella generated cell data is imported to Spotfire. The primary screen is performed at a single concentration of 5 µM in two replicate plates. Only those plates that pass the robust Z’ of > 0.3 are analyzed. Compounds that show ? 50% inhibition in bacterial number and ? 20% loss in cell number are considered as hits. Appropriate down selected hits are then evaluated in dose response studies to determine the potency (EC50) and cytotoxicity (CC50). 
Protocol
RAW264.7 murine macrophages are seeded in a 384 well imaging plate (30 µl media). After 24 hours, cells are pre-treated with the compounds (5 µM final concentration) or DMSO in control wells ( ? 0.5% final concentration) for 2 hours. After two hours of incubation with the compounds, the cells are infected with B. pseudomallei (K96243, 1 MOI, 10 µl). To kill the extracellular bacteria, kanamycin (500 µg/ml, 5 µl) is added four hours post Bp infection. At eight hours post infection, cells are fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours. The plates are then washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and then macrophages are permeabilized and blocked for one hour with DPBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA. To detect bacteria, cells are incubated for 1 hr with the antibody against B. pseudomallei (AB-BUR-P-MAB3). After subsequent washing and incubation for 1 hr with the goat anti-mouse Daylight 488 secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer), the cells are stained with Hoechst nuclear dye (Invitrogen H3570, 1 mg/ml in PBS) and CellMask Deep Red dye following manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen H32721, 5 mg/ml in PBS). The automated image acquisition is performed using an Opera QEHS confocal system (Perkin Elmer) and images analyzed using Acapella software. A compound that exhibits a ? 50% inhibition/reduction in bacterial number and ? 20% loss in cell number is considered a hit and then further evaluated in dose response studies.

Immunofluorescence 
Detection Method
to quantitate intracellular bacteria, acapella’s spot detection algorithm is used to detect and quantify internalized and cell associated bacteria. bacteria are detected as spots in a specified search region (wholecell) having a higher intensity than its surroundings. to separate the spatial noise peaks and other artifacts, all spots detected initially are regarded as spot candidates. spot candidates are then separated as ‘‘classified spots’’ based on two parameters. 1. contrast (i.e. contrast between the maximum intensity and the local background intensity near the spot candidate) and 2. spot-to-cell intensity (i.e. the ratio between the maximum intensity of the spot candidate and the average intensity of the cell to which the spot object belongs). the spot detection analyses results in various properties of spots and host cells as described elsewhere [kota 2013]. ‘‘classified spots’’, ‘‘number of spots per cell’’ and ‘‘integrated spot signal per cellular signal local background subtracted, over the whole searchregion’’ and ‘cell number’’ parameters are used for further analysis.
equations for signal-to-noise ratio, percent coefficient of variation, and z? values, as defined by (zhang et al 1999) are used for data analyses. the robustness of the assay is determined by calculating the z’ on a per plate basis (z’ = (1- (3 x stdev of signalmax (neutral/infection only control) + 3 x stdev signalmin (inhibitor/no infection control))/abs(mean signalmax – mean of signalmin)). only those plates that have a z’ >0.3 are considered for data analysis. to determine percent of bacterial infection inhibition and cytotoxicity, the acapella generated cell data is imported to spotfire (visual analysis statistical software, perkin elmer inc., ma). the formula that is used to calculate % bacterial inhibition and cytotoxicity is 
100 - {(compound treated bacterial or cell number/neutral control)*100}. in the primary screen, a compound is considered a hit if it shows in both the replicate plates, a ? 50% inhibition of bacterial counts and ? 20% loss in cell number compared to infected controls. 
note: although cytochalasin is known to inhibit bp infection, it was used in this screen to only determine the reproducibility of the assay and not for calculation of the z’ or % inhibition. 

Detection Reagents
Primary mouse monoclonal antibody AB-BUR-P-MAB3 and secondary goat anti mouse Daylight 488 antibody (1:500) are used to detect bacteria. The cells are stained with Hoechst dye (Invitrogen H3570, 1 mg/ml in PBS) and CellMask Deep Red dye (Invitrogen H32721, 5 mg/ml in PBS) to detect host cell nucleus and cytoplasm respectively.

Screen in Luciferase-expressing E. histolytica protocol,"This is a cell based phenotypic screen to find in the ReFRAME library compounds capable of inhibit growth of Entamoeba histolytica strain HM-I:IMSS. The parasite expresses luciferase. Decrease of luminescence signal compared to non-treated parasites will be related to growth inhibition.
Purpose
Amoebiasis is a neglected disease affecting millions of people worldwide with poor and considerably toxic treatment options. The parasite infects 500 million people annually and causes colitis and liver abscess in over 50 million people a year with an estimated 100,000 deaths, making it a leading cause of parasitic death in humans. In our assay, we identify small molecule inhibitors by measuring the viability of trophozoite-stage E. histolytica. Metronidazol is the standard of care for amoebiasis, and it is used as positive control. Activity is detected by reduction of luminescence signal compared to the negative control DMSO.
Protocol
Entamoeba histolytica HM-1: IMSS trophozoites stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct (CS-luc) are cultivated at 37? C in logaritimc phase. The library plates are be kept at -20?C until the day of the experiment, when they are left at RT for 24 hours before plating. The cells are harvest by icing and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The parasites are plated at 384 white plates pinned with the library drugs using a multidrop dispenser at a final volume of 100 uL/well with 3000 parasites per well. Plates are kept in anaerobic chamber (BD GasPaktm EZ) at 37? C. For the read out, plates are kept at RT for 40 min to equilibrate temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm, the media is aspirated using the ELX405 microplate washer in a aspiration setting. The reagent BrightGlo (Promega) is diluted 1:1 with 1X PBS and also equilibrated to RT. Passed the 40 min, 20 uL/well of the reagent is added to the plates with multidrop. They are read at Tecan M1000PRO between 40-60 min after adding the reagent. Activity of inhibitors is detected by reduction of luminescence signal compared to the negative control DMSO.

Cells are then washed, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with SuperBlock (Thermo), and finally stained with a 1:10 dilution of Superblock with 1ug/mL FITC-tagged Vicia Villosa lectin and 3uM DAPI nuclear stain. Cells are then washed with PBS-T to remove residual stain and plates are sealed with aluminum adhesive seals. Plates are imaged (10x objective) on the CX5 Cellomics imager using the SpotDetector algorithm. Compounds that inhibit Cryptosporidium proliferation by >= 70% and do not inhibit HCT-8 growth by more than 40% are picked for dose response testing.

Crypto-HCT-8 Host Cells (C. hominis),"Cell-based assay which allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity using high-content imaging detection
Purpose
This is a secondary assay for hits active against C. parvum IOWA (Sterling and Bunch Grass Farm strains). Cryptosporidium parvum and the related species Cryptosporidium hominis cause diarrheal disease in humans. The current standard of care is ineffective in patients most at risk of cryptosporidiosis. This is a concomitant readout from the high-content imaging-based high-throughput screen of the full deck against the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. HCI detection of this cell-based assay allows for concomitant measurement of Cryptosporidium parasite inhibition and host cell cytotoxicity.
Protocol
This specific ID is for HCT-8 host cells infected with C. hominis (TU502), which has been routinely passaged through neonatal gnotobiotic piglets at Tufts University by the Tzipori lab. For the assay, HCT-8 cells are seeded into 1536-well clear-bottom plates and incubated at 37C. 24 hours later, compounds are transferred (1.88 uM for primary screening and 25 uM top concentration for dose-response), and then excysted Cryptosporidium sporozoites and oocysts are dispensed onto cells. 48 hours later, cells are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.

SigmaE-Hfq inhibition,"Screen for inhibitors of the sigmaE-Hfq gene regulation pathway in Gram-negative bacteria
Purpose
This assay simultaneously looks for inhibitors of two key steps in the SigmaE-Hfq pathway: transcription by SigmaE and inhibition of translation by Hfq in conjunction with the RybB sRNA. SigmaE is a stress-inducible subunit of RNA polymerase and is required for viability and/or virulence in many Gram-negative pathogens. Hfq binds to sRNAs and facilitates their interaction with target mRNA, most often leading to inhibition of target gene expression. Hfq is required for virulence in many pathogens. Small molecular inhibitors of Hfq are expected to act as virulence inhibitors. SigmaE inhibitors are expected to result in growth inhibition of pathogens in which SigmaE is required for viability and virulence inhibitors for pathogens in which SigmaE is required for virulence.  An assay strain that does not produce SigmaE and RybB will be used as a positive control.
Protocol
Grow overnight (O/N) cultures of screening and control strains in LB at 37¬?C in batch culture. Inoculate O/N cultures into fresh LB in flasks to OD600 = 0.02. Grow cultures at 37 ¬?C with aeration to OD600 = 0.2 (1.5 to 2 h). Add IPTG to 1 mM final concentration to induce rpoE expression. Transfer 50 ¬µl of the screening strain to 96-well plates except for well A1, transfer 50 ¬µl control strain to well A1. Adhere sealing film and incubate at 37 ¬?C without shaking for 45 min in humid chamber. Add AHT to final concentration of 100 ng/ml and seal with new sealing film.

Identification of inhibitors of multiplication in cultured cells of the prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV),"Identification of inhibitors targeting any of the steps of multiplication in cultured cells of the prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).
Purpose
Several mammarenaviruses, chiefly Lassa virus (LASV) in West Africa, cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease in humans and pose a serious public health problem in their endemic regions. Thus, LASV infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly in West Africa resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases associated with high morbidity and mortality. Notably, increased traveling to and from endemic regions has led to the importation of LF into non-endemic metropolitan areas around the globe. In addition, evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic mammarenavirus LCMV is a neglected important human pathogen of clinical significance. Moreover, because their stability, high morbidity and potential for aerosol transmission together with their unrestricted source from their natural rodent hosts, LASV and other HF mammarenaviruses pose a credible biodefense threat.  Concerns about mammarenavirus infections of humans are aggravated by the lack of US-FDA licensed vaccines and current anti-arenavirus therapy being restricted to ribavirin, which is only partially effective and associated with side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of novel antiviral drugs to combat mammarenavirus infections. To this end, we have developed a robust cell-based assay to identify inhibitors of LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. The assay is based on the use of a recombinant LCMV expressing the ZsGreen reporter gene (rLCMV/ZsG). Levels of ZsGreen expression serve as surrogate of levels of virus multiplication. The assay has parameters compatible with HTS (S/B > 10, CV ‚â§ 10% and Z‚Äô > 0.5). 
Primary hits will be subjected to secondary screens for confirmation and authentication and to rule out false positives. Validated hits will be used in dose-response assays to assess their potency (EC50) and toxicity (CC50), and hits with the highest selectivity index (SI, SI = CC50/EC50) and biological properties of interest will be advanced to studies using an already developed battery of cell-based assays to identify the steps of the virus life cycle being targeted by the hits uncovered by the screen, as well as to test their activity against LASV. 
Protocol
Compounds are pre-spotted onto Greiner 384w black clear bottom. Primary screen of the ReFrame library is conducted at a single dose of 10 ŒºM final concentration per compound. DMSO (0.001%) is used as vehicle negative control and Ribavirin (100 uM ¬µM final concentration), a validated inhibitor of LCMV multiplication, is used as a positive control. Vero cells (1x106 cells/well, M6 plate) are infected for 1h with rLCMV/ZsGreen at moi = 0.01. After 1 hour infection, a single cell suspension is prepared and seeded at 103 cells/ 384 well, 30 ¬µl/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 48 hour infection at 37 C, 5% CO2, 15 ul ¬µl of 12% PFA- PBS is added (4% PFA final concentration) and cells are fixed for 30 min, followed by removal of fixative, and 1x wash with PBS. Cells are stained with DAPI for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. ZsGreen expression levels and DAPI staining levels are quantified using a fluorescent plate reader (Advanced Hybrid microplate reader Synergy H4) using the appropriate wavelengths to both excite and to measure emission of ZsGreen. Similarly, the appropriate wavelengths are selected for measurement of DAPI levels. Preliminary hits are identified based on low toxicity (cell biomass >60%, as determined by DAPI staining) and strong (>50%) inhibition of ZsGreen expression compared to vehicle-treated and infected cells. Primary hits are confirmed in the same assay format by a repeat experiment using three replicate wells per compound. Confirmed hits are tested in a dose-response assay and EC50 and CC50 values calculated (Prism using a non-linear regression curve fit).

Percent inhibition of ZsGreen expression levels (as a measure of viral LCMV multiplication) is calculated by dividing the fluorescent level of the compound treated cells (test well) by the average fluorescent level (average of 8 wells) in DMSO treated wells, and values normalized to % multiplying by 100.  Values for ribavirin-treated control samples (8 wells) are calculated in the same way. DAPI levels are compared similarly to DMSO control levels as a measure of cell biomass. Levels of ZsGreen expression in ribavirin-treated control wells are consistently < 5% of those obtained in vehicle (DMSO)-treated control wells. Mock-infected cells have a consistent small background fluorescence that can be subtracted from both compound- treated and control wells before determining percentage inhibition.

Trypanosoma cruzi Assay,"This target-free high-content screen aims to find compounds that are able to eliminate the Trypanosoma cruzi parasites without affecting the host cell viability.
Purpose
Chagas‚Äô disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite infects human cells and replicates intracellularly. Chagas‚Äô pathology includes cardiomyopathy and/or digestive syndromes (megacolon and megaesophagus). In our screening assay, we use myoblast cell line (C2C12) and infect with T. cruzi parasites. We incubate the compounds for 72 hours, followed by fixation and staining with DAPI. Images are taken from the wells and a software is used to assess number of host cell and number of parasites. The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of parasite number compared to the non-treated controls. We use benznidazole as reference drug and positive control (100% parasite reduction). Since we apply a phenotypic readout, we do also quantify cytotoxicity of the compound calculating the number of host cells compared to untreated controls.


Protocol
C2C12 and T.cruzi are collected from culture flasks and counted. A batch infection is prepared by mixing cells and parasites in solution (DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin). Multidrop Combi (Thermo) is used to dispense 10ul of that solution in the assay plates containing the compounds.  Plates are incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 incubators for 72h. After incubation, 5ul/well is aspirated using EL-406 (Biotek) and we dispense 5ul of 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to fix the samples using the Multidrop Combi. After at least 30 minutes incubation with PFA solution at room temperature, we aspirate the content and wash one time with isotonic buffer. Next, we add DAPI solution (5ug/ml) for DNA staining for at least 30 minutes before reading the plates in ImageXpress MicroXL (Molecular Devices). The images are analyzed by a custom module algorithm in MetaXpress (Molecular Devices) to determine the number of host cells and number of parasites per well.

THP1-ISRE-SEAP,"Identification of back-up compounds to support the development of a STING agonist for immuno-oncology using a reporter assay for IFN signaling activation.
Purpose
Activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and subsequent engagement of the type I interferon pathway are key components of the innate immune system. Many STING pathway agonists have been identified and are being investigated as potential immuno-oncology therapeutic approaches to engage the immune system and eliminate the growth of tumors. To date, while analogs of the endogenous ligand 2'3'cGAMP have been evaluated in oncology patients, there are no small molecules which activate the STING pathway clinical investigated. To identify a small molecule that activates the STING pathway, a THP-1-based reporter system was used which overexpresses the interferon response element upstream of a secreted alkaline phosphophase (SEAP) reporter. Upon activation of type I interferon signaling, an increase in SEAP in the conditioned mediate is detected by the addition of the substrate. Subsequent counterscreening in a STING-null THP-1 line will focus the efforts on compounds which are dependent upon STING for the activation process.

P. berghei complete liver stage,"Multimodal phenotypic screen spanning the entirety of Plasmodium berghei liver stage development in HepG2 cells to identify antimalarial compounds for chemoprotection. The workflow combines a vital luciferase-based biomass readout with subsequent  high content imaging of fixed parasites.
Purpose
Multimodal phenotypic screen spanning the entirety of Plasmodium berghei liver stage development in HepG2 cells to identify antimalarial compounds for chemoprotection. Targeting liver stage malaria parasites is an ideal for chemoprophylaxis, as blocking infection in the liver will prevent both human disease and parasite transmission.  Liver stage parasites must both replicate and then differentiate to produce hepatic merozoites, the forms infectious to erythrocytes, to complete liver stage development.  In addition to a canonical indirect readout of immature liver stage parasite biomass, we incorporate high content imaging with several maturation markers to evalutate hepatic merozoite formation and terminal phenotypes induced by compound treatment.
Protocol
Assay is performed in white, microclear-bottomed 384 well plates, with final screening concentration of 5 micromolar. Parasite development is assessed with a vital luminescence-based assay after 46 hours of compound treatment, followed by compound readdition for a further 24 hours. Infected monolayers are fixed after parasite development should be complete, and high content imaging of individual parasite maturation state is performed.

Male Contraceptive Screen (Motility),"High-throughput screen for male contraceptive targeting sperm motility
Purpose
The Gates Foundation has identified the need for a male contraceptive. We have developed a dual readout phenotypic assay to screen for sperm function: 1) Multiple sperm motility parameters are measured using high-throughput live cell microscopy and cell tracking; 2) the status of the acrosome (a sperm specific Golgi-derived organelle) is measured using high-throughput flow cytometry. 
The assays are in 384-well format and because they run sequentially which leads to a massive increase in throughput as compared to previous attempts in human sperm drug screening and allows for very efficient use of donor sample material. The assay is fully automated, flexible (screen for increased and decreased motility, acrosome agonists or antagonists) and extendible (e.g. for Ca2+ measurements). Furthermore, we have developed automated data analysis workflows to track sperm cells (motility assessment) and to gate sperm population (acrosome assessment).  
Protocol
Compounds are pre-spotted onto 384w black clear bottom microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer 6007550) at 6.25 uM for primary screen and 10uM top concentration for dose response. Human sperm from pooled donors is prepared, diluted, and dispensed 20uL into assay pre-spotted plates. Controls is added to columns 23/24. The plates are incubated for 10 minute at 37C and moved to CV7000 for fast imaging to look for sperm motility. The plates are then removed and stain and control are added for the acrosome reaction. The plates are incubated and moved to iQue screener for flow cytometry. Both data sets are processed using custom informatics solution.

Growth-based high throughput screening of small molecule libraries against anaerobic microbial choline metabolism,"Phenotypic screening looking for growth inhibitors of E. coli when it‚Äôs cultured in minimal media containing choline as carbon source, but that don‚Äôt inhibit growth on glycerol as carbon source. Bacterial growth is the indirect phenotypic signal of TMA inhibition, which will be subsequently evaluated using a LC/MS method.
Purpose
A prevalent number of bacterial species that inhabit the human gut can utilize the dietary nutrient choline as a source of carbon and energy, while releasing trimethylamine (TMA) as a byproduct. More specifically, the cut gene cluster that contains the genes that code for choline-TMA lyase (CutC) and its activating enzyme (CutD) are responsible to cleaving choline into acetaldehyde and TMA. The former can be used as source of energy via fermentation, whereas the latter is a byproduct of this metabolism. TMA, however, gets excreted out of the human body through the liver, where it gets oxidized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMAO has a profound effect on the host's physiology, including the onset of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes. Furthermore, the cut gene cluster is found in a prevalent number of gut commensal bacteria, which emphasizes the need to specifically target this microbial pathway. This assay, which is based on a phenotypic high throughput screening, will reveal compounds that interfere with the microbial choline utilization and its transformation into TMA by inhibiting the growth of bacteria when choline is the sole carbon-energy source.
Protocol
384-well plates will be filled with compounds previously dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 uM. Columns 1 to 22 are the experimental wells. Columns 23 and 24 are controls, containing 60 ug/mL kanamycin, and DMSO, respectively. Each compound will be screened in singlicate. Once we obtain the plates, they will be left to equilibrate in the anaerobic chamber overnight. Next, we will add 50 uL of previously reduced NCE (non-carbon essential) media containing 20 mM choline and inoculate with E. coli MS-200-1 to an initial OD600 ~ 0.1. We will measure OD600 after 7 and 20 h of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees Celsius. The compounds that inhibit growth on choline (Z-score =<-2) will be re-tested at the same concentration but in NCE media containing 2.5 g/l glycerol (as counter-screening). Those compounds that don't inhibit growth under this condition (Z-score >= 0) will be picked for dose response against TMA generation.
Readout
The OD600 of the experimental wells will be analyzed in terms of their Z-score (Zscore = [ODwell - ŒºPlate]/Œ¥plate). We will calculate the Z-prime score using the control wells (Z-prime = 1 - [3Œ¥neg-3Œ¥pos)/(Œºneg-Œºpos)]

WRAIR Leishmania Luciferin Amastigote Macrophage Assay (4 day),"Leishmania amastigote stage microtiter plate drug sensitivity assay
Purpose
The intracellular amastigote assay is a microtiter plate drug sensitivity assay that uses the activity of luciferase as a measure of proliferation of luciferase-expressing leishmania parasites developing intracellularly inside RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence of antileishmanial drugs or experimental compounds. As the activity of luciferase and its associated luminescence after addition of the substrate, luciferin, is relative to parasite growth, a test compound that inhibits the growth of the parasite will result in a lower luminescence.
Protocol
Macrophages were harvested from culture by removing all spent media, adding in 10mL fresh media, scraping cells, and counted using Trypan Blue. The cells were resuspended at 2.0x105 cells/mL, and then dispensed in a volume of 50 ¬µL to yield a final concentration of 10,000 macrophages/well in 384 well tissue-culture treated sterile white plates (Nunc/Thermo Fisher, Rochester, NY) using a Tecan EVO Freedom robotics system. The plates were then incubated at 37o C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 hours.  After incubation, the media was removed from each well using the Tecan EVO Freedom robot, and L. major promastigotes were added to each well and allowed to invade the macrophages. Metacyclic stage promastigotes provide the best invasion for this assay, and cultures should be grown to increase the percentage of metacyclic promastigotes for best results. Promastigotes were harvested from culture, counted, suspended at 2x106 promastigotes/mL in DMEM/HIFBS media, and 100,000 promastigotes were dispensed per well in a volume of 50 ¬µL. After overnight incubation, the media was removed from each well using the Tecan Freedom EVO robot, and each well was subsequently washed three times with 40 ¬µL of fresh DMEM/HIFBS medium to remove all extracellular promastigotes. After the third wash, 69.2¬µL of DMEM/HIFBS medium was added to each well using the Tecan EVO Freedom robot.  7.7 ¬µL of diluted test compound was added to the 69.2 ¬µL of media present in each well.  The plates were placed in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) which contained a humidity source, consisting of soaked gauze in a weigh boat, which was placed in the bottom of the chamber.  Both valves on the system were opened and using a vent filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), attached to the one valve, mixed gas containing 5% O2, 5% CO2, and a balance of nitrogen was allowed to pass through the system for sixty seconds.  After sixty seconds, the exit valve was closed and the mixed gas was allowed to flow into the chamber for 10 seconds.  At that point the remaining valve was closed.  Chambers were gassed every other day.  The chambers were incubated at 37¬?C for 96 hours.  After 96 hours of incubation, 7.5 ¬µL of a luciferin solution (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) diluted to 150¬µg/mL was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37¬?C, in the dark. Each plate was read using an Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Inc., Durham, NC). Compounds were initially screened for percent inhibition. Hit compounds (compound hit is defined as one that inhibits the parasite growth ‚â• 75% after 96 hours of incubation in the assay) were retested in the assay and assessed for IC50 determination using an 8-point serial dilution. The final concentration test range was 0.0044 to 20uM. IC50s were calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Measuring cell sickling times to screen for drugs that treat sickle cell disease by inhibiting hemoglobin S polymerization.,"A sensitive kinetic assay is being used to screen for compounds that can be drugs for treating sickle cell disease.  The assay measures the sickling time distribution of red cells from sickle cell trait, the heterozygous condition.
Purpose
The root cause of the pathology of sickle cell disease is the polymerization of the mutant hemoglobin S upon deoxygenation in the tissues to form fibers that distort (""sickle"") and stiffen red cells.  The less flexible cells may not pass through the narrowest vessels of the tissues, thereby causing vaso-occlusion, which results in chronic organ damage and intermittent episodes of pain so severe that they are called ""sickle cell crises"". There are six distinct mechanisms to inhibit sickling with anti-polymerization drugs for treating the disease (outlined in detail in WA Eaton and HF Bunn, Blood, 129: 2719-2726, 2017). Our assay screens for all but fetal hemoglobin induction, but will be key for monitoring the sickling of blood from patients in clinical trials taking drugs that inhibit polymerization by inducing fetal hemoglobin or by any of the other five mechanisms. By far the most sensitive assay for testing the inhibitory effect of potential drugs is to measure its effect on the sickling time, which is the delay time prior to fiber formation in intact red cells. The assay is also the most patho-physiologically relevant, since increasing the delay time allows more cells to escape the narrow vessels of the tissues before fibers form, thereby lowering the probability of vaso-occlusion.
Protocol
Blood from donors with sickle cell trait, the heterozygous condition, is diluted 3000-fold into a physiological buffer at pH 7.35 consisting of 20 mM phosphate, 134 mM NaCl, 1 g/L dextrose. 10 microliters of this red cell suspension is added to each well of the 384 well plate. 252 wells are spotted with 100 picomoles of compounds from the reFRAME library. Of the remaining 132 wells, 32 (columns 3 and 22) contain only the red cell suspension and serve as neutral (negative) controls, while 32 (columns 2 and 23) contain a red cell suspension in a buffer of 180 millimolar and serve as inhibitor (positive) controls, since the increase in volume at the decreased osmolarity dilutes the intracellular hemoglobin sufficiently to prevent sickling. The 68 wells that line the edge of the plate contain controls, but are not considered in the analysis because of possible edge effects. The plate is inserted into a humidified thermostated chamber in air of the Biotek â€œLionheartâ€ microscope system for two hours at 37 C followed by deoxygenation with 100% nitrogen for up to 12 hours at 37 C, with images collected every 15 minutes (the time required to collect an image from all 384 wells). Compounds that increase the sickling times to an extent that is therapeutic will be selected for studies of the concentration dependence on sickle trait cells to determine the lowest concentration at which they have therapeutic potential. For compounds that are known to be non-toxic at the concentration predicted to be therapeutic, sickling time measurements will be performed using the same assay on cells from patients with homozygous sickle cell disease, but with 5% oxygen to slow sickling.
Readout
A compound will be labeled a ""hit"" if it results in a percent sickled relative to neutral control (with 70-80% sickled, the maximum of the Z-factor) of 50% or less. This is the upper limit of the percent sickled expected for trait cells in which 50% of the total hemoglobin in trait cells has been replaced by hemoglobin C, mimicking SC disease, which is known to be a milder form of sickle cell disease (explained in detail in Li et al, PNAS 2017).
Detection Method
the image of 100-200 cells in each well on a ccd camera is collected every 15 minutes, the time required to collect an image from all 384 wells during deoxygenation. sickling times are determined by monitoring several metrics of the cell image to determine during which 15-minute interval the cell has sickled. this analysis is accomplished using our in-house developed, robust image analysis software (described in detail in li et al., pnas 114: e689-e696, 2017). these metrics include the eccentricity (deviation from the circular projection of the unsickled biconcave disc shape), the ratio of the optical density at the periphery of the cell to that at the cell center (unsickled cells are more transparent in the center), and the projected area of the cell (sickled cells have a smaller projection than unsickled cells).

Biofilm-Inhibitory of Candida Growth,"Colormetric high-throughput screen against Candida auris to find new small molecule inhibitors of Candida biofilm formation. Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection and formation of Candida biofilms complicates treatment due to the intrinsic resistance of cells within biofilms against most clinically-used antifungal drug.
Purpose
There is an urgent need for new antifungal agents. Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection, now representing the 3rd leading nosocomial infection in the US. Formation of biofilms complicates treatment due to the intrinsic resistance of cells within biofilms against most clinically-used antifungal drugs. Also, a new species, Candida auris, represents an emerging threat due to multidrug resistance. Our primary screen utilizes the 96-well microtiter plate model of Candida biofilm formation originally developed by our group, in search for compounds with biofilm-inhibitory activity. For secondary/confirmatory experiments, we test the hit compounds directly in dose-response assays.
Protocol
Day1: To 96-well plates containing library compounds dispense 60 ul of a suspension of C. auris cells in RPMI medium. Incubate 24 hr Day2: Wash plates and add XTT reagent. Incubate for approx 2 h, transfer suprenatant to new plate and read color in microtiter plate reader.

ppGpp hydrolysis assay,"Identification of inhibitors of RelMTB-mediated (p)ppGpp hydrolysis for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Purpose
The RelMTB enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential for virulence, absent from eukaryotes, and has yet to be pursued as a drug target. The RelMTB enzyme encodes two enzymatic activities. A synthetase domain transfers the pyrophosphate (PPi) group from ATP to GDP and GTP to synthesize ppGpp and pppGpp, respectively. (p)ppGpp then modulates a number of cellular processes required for pathogenesis. An N-terminal hydrolase domain within RelMTB hydrolyzes (p)ppGpp into PPi and GDP or GTP. Genetic inhibition of RelMTB hydrolase activity during both acute and chronic infection compromises Mtb survival. Therefore, the RelMTB hydrolase activity is essential for virulence and holds promise as a target for new chemotherapeutic strategies. To identify compounds that inhibit RelMTB hydrolase activity and would kill M. tuberculosis during infection, we developed an in vitro enzymatic assay that produces fluorescence proportionally dependent on the concentration of the reaction product, GDP. This assay can detect greater than 10x increase in signal over background due to specific product formation, is specific for RelMTB hydrolase activity where a catalytically dead mutant of the enzyme does not produce significant signal, and has an average Z' value of 0.9. This 384 well assay has been adapted at Washington University High Throughput Screening Core (HTSC) Facility with Dr. Maxene Ilagan, the scientific director of the HTSC, and Michael Prinsen.
Protocol
The assay protocol utilizes a multidrop to add Assay Buffer (50mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 500¬µM MnCl2) containing 30nM RelMTB and 5¬µM ppGpp (substrate) to 384 well Corning 3575 non-binding plates pre-spotted with 20nl 10mM compound for a 20¬µM final concentration. Reactions are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.  At 1 hour, the Bellbrooks Labs Transcreener reagent containing Stop buffer, antibody, and tracer are added with a multidrop and allowed to incubate ~ 1 hour before reading fluorescence on a TECAN Safire II  (Ex: 580/10, Em: 620/10).

Block Rings and Gametocytes in the Spleen to Eradicate Malaria,"High-throughput “microsphiltration” screening for potential malaria-transmission blocking compounds that stiffen Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes inducing their splenic retention and clearance from circulation. 
Purpose
Malaria is a parasitosis caused by a protozoan of Plasmodium genus. Plasmodium spp share their complex life cycle between two organisms: a mammal host where disease shows up, during erythrocytic infection, and an Anopheles mosquito vector where its sexual development takes place. For this reason, gametocytes are the major target in order to block parasite transmission from host to vector. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible of the most lethal form of malaria in humans. During the splenic circulation, a proportion of erythrocytes must cross narrow inter-endothelial slits to persist in circulation. Only highly deformable cells can do it. A single erythrocyte is “checked” by spleen every 100-200 minutes. Mature gametocytes are flexible enough to cross the splenic filter and this allows the transmission to mosquito vector. Microsphiltration, a contraction between microspheres and filtration, is a bio-mimetic approach able to reproduce splenic filter using a mixture of calibrated metal microspheres. Microsphiltration has been adapted to a 384-wells format in order to perform high-throughput screening (HTS) for stiffening compounds that induce splenic retention of mature gametocytes, with the aim to block parasite transmission.
Protocol
Preparation of microsphiltration plate: 15?l of 25-45?m diameter and 10?l of 30% 5-15?m and 70% (w/w) 15-25?m diameter microspheres (for each size a 50/50 v/v solution with PBS-Albumax 1% is prepared) are deposed in a 384-wells filter plate with Biomek NX workstation. A vacuum aspiration step with 50?l of PBS-Albumax is performed to rinse the microspheres. Plates are then stored at -20oC (day of expiration: six months after preparation, approximately). 
Plasmodium falciparum NF54 strain parasites are cultivated with “Gams medium” (RPMI-1640 medium with 50 mg/l Hypoxanthine, 2 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 1 g/l Albumax II, 10% human serum, 0,4 g/l glucose and 60 mg/l L-glutamine) at 4% hematocrit (erythrocytes from blood of informed donors, A+, screened for human pathogens). Gametocytes production is started from 0,5% ring-stage parasites (day 0) and medium is daily changed. At day 17 gametocytes are concentrated by density-gradient centrifugation and parasitemia is adjusted using FACS (Sybr-Green and MitoTracker staining, 3-5% targeted). Hematocrit is finely adjusted to 0,5% using Neubauer chamber. Gametocytes are then transferred into a pre-spotted compound plate (45?l/well) and then incubated 24 hours at 37 ºC.
Preparation of imaging plates: 30?l/well of staining solution 1 (PBS with Syto40 Blue Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain 50?M, MitoTracker Deep Red FM 0,5?M, CellMask Orange Plasma Membrane Stain 0,4x) are manually loaded to a PerkinElmer 384 plate to prepare imaging plates for readout 1 (killing and retention rate of all gametocytes). The same amount of staining solution 2 (RPMI-1640 enriched with Hypoxanthine 50 mg/l, sodium bicarbonate 2 g/l and xanthurenic acid 50?M to activate gametocytes plus anti-Pfs25 mab Cy3 conjugated 8,7 ?g/ml and CellMask Deep Red Plasma Membrane Stain 1x) is added to prepare readout 2 (killing and retention rate of female gametocytes) imaging plates.
Automated microsphiltration: using Biomek NX Workstation connected with a pump to create vacuum, gametocytes from compound plate (see second paragraph) are transferred into a filter-plate (see first paragraph) and filtrated in a splenic-mimetic system (microsphiltration). Microsphiltration is performed with three different vacuum-based aspirations, as follow:
1.	Re-humidification of microsphere layers: 50?l of buffer (Gams medium)
2.	Microsphiltration: 25?l of gametocytes + 25?l of buffer
3.	Rinsing of microsphiltration plate: 80?l of buffer 
Both up- and down-stream samples are loaded (12?l for UP and 16?l for DS) in two different imaging plates (see previous paragraph) and incubated ON at 25ºC.
Imaging plates are read in an “OperaPhenix high-content confocal imaging” (5 fields/well, approximately 10000 cells counted), coupled with an analysis system. 

Readout
Imaging plates are read into an OperaPhenix high-content confocal imaging fluorescent microscope with following excitation/emission wavelengths. The first readout is with Syto Blue 405/441 nm, CellMask Orange 532/555 nm, MitoTracker Deep Red 635/665 nm. The second readout is with CellMask Deep Red 635/660 nm, Cy3 532/568 nm. The first image analysis readout is done with rounded CellMask Orange positive objects selected as total erythrocytes and double positive Syto and MitoTracker, crescent shape (width-length ratio inferior to 0,61) selected as viable gametocytes. The percentage of infected erythrocytes is calculated with the formula “viable gametocytes * 100 / total erythrocytes. The second image analysis readout is done with rounded CellMask Deep Red positive objects selected as total erythrocytes and rounded Cy3 positive objects selected as activated female gametes. The percentage of infected erythrocytes is calculated with the formula “female gametes * 100 / total erythrocytes). Killing and retention rates are calculated with the following formulas: Killing rate = 100 - ((%UP * 100) / Average %UP DMSO wells)) and retention rate = 100 * ((%UP - %DS) / %UP)).

Mfd translocase NanoLuc reporter assay (1536w),"Identification of Mfd translocase protein inhibitors via a NanoLuc Luciferase-based reporter gene assay.
Purpose
This NanoLuc Luciferase-based reporter assay has been developed to identify inhibitors of the Mfd translocase, which could serve as anti-evolution compounds limiting the emergence of antibiotic resistance among clinically relevant bacteria.  Mfd is a bacterial protein involved in initiation of transcription-coupled repair (ie. a transcription-repair coupling factor).  Therefore, inhibition of Mfd activity decreases fidelity of transcription and is predicted to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance in populations of bacteria under selection pressure, as occurs during prolonged treatment of persistent infections. The translocase assay consists of an E. coli Î”mfd strain and a two-plasmid system. One plasmid consists of a NanoLuc reporter construct where luminescence is controlled by Mfdâ€™s translocase function, while the second plasmid encodes for Salmonella Mfd.
Protocol
E. coli HM3419 translocase assay strain (NM525 Î”mfd with pUC-mfd + pRCB-Nluc (TetR + CarbR)) is grown for approximately 24 h in minimal media, at 37C, shaking. Appropriate antibiotics (Tet + Carb) are used throughout the assay. Compounds are pre-spotted into 1536-well, white, solid bottom plates (20 uM for primary screen and 40 uM top concentration for dose-response) and E. coli HM3419 culture, OD-adjusted in minimal media, is dispensed into these prepared plates. Calmidazolium chloride (20 uM) is used as a stimulator scale reference in lieu of a true activator control and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control. Following a 4 h incubation at 37C the luminescence signal is read using Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a microplate reader.

Helminth: B. malayi microfilariae (3 Day),"Brugia pahangi worm motility assay
Purpose
At the University of California at San Francisco, adult female Brugia pahangi worms are used in the primary screens to identify a macrofilaricidal candidate. Adult female Brugia are initially screened in quadruplicate in 24 well plates at a single concentration from 1-10¬µM. Worms treated with 1% DMSO only are used as controls. Worms are kept in a 37¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay. Worm motility (phenotypic screening) is assessed on Day 0 (the day worms are treated with compound), Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Day 6 using an imaging system called The Worminator. Mean movement units (worms moving are assessed as pixels displaced per second) generated from The Worminator on Day 3 and Day 6 are converted into % inhibitions of worm motility compared to controls treated with 1% DMSO only. A compound hit is defined as one that inhibits the motility of the adult female worm ‚â• 75% by Day 3 of the assay. If a compound inhibits motility of the worms consistently in at least two assays at single concentrations, an IC50 is performed using a 6-point serial dilution starting at 30¬µM. IC50s are calculated using GraphPad Prism.
Protocol

PLoS Negl Trop Dis 9(2): e0003534 with modifications for ReFrame screen Drug screening of adult Brugia worms in vitro Adult female Brugia pahangi were shipped from Univ. of Missouri-Columbia and assayed using methods described by Marcellino et al. (2012). Individual females are placed in each well of a 24-well plate with media (RPMI-1640 with 25 mMHEPES, 2.0 g/L NaHCO3, 5% heat inactivated FBS, and 1X Antibiotic/Antimycotic solution). Worms are transfered to new 24-well plates upon arrival with 500 ŒºL of media per well. Initial ReFrame compound screening is conducted at 3 ŒºM per compound, and 1% DMSO is used as a negative control. All drugs are dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) stock solutions are stored at -20¬?C. Four worms were used as replicates for each concentration and worm plates are kept in a 37¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay except during motility readings. To determine the effect of a compound on worm motility, individual worm movements are counted as the number of pixels displaced per second by each worm in each well using the Worminator (see Marcellino C, et al. (2012) WormAssay: A Novel Computer Application for Whole-Plate Motion-based Screening of Macroscopic Parasites. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6(1): e1494. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001494). Each plate of worms is video recorded for approximately 60 seconds, and mean movement units (MMUs) are determined for individual worms. Percent inhibition of motility is calculated by dividing the MMUs of the treated worms by the control average MMUs, subtracting the value from 1.0, flooring the values to zero and multiplying by 100%. Videos are recorded each day, including the first day of the assay (Day 0). Compounds that inhibit worm motility can be tested in IC50 assays. Prism is used to calculate IC50 values using a non-linear regression curve fit.

(2012) WormAssay: A Novel Computer Application for Whole-Plate Motion-based Screening of Macroscopic Parasites. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6(1): e1494. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001494). Each plate of worms is video recorded for approximately 60 seconds, and the mean movement units (MMUs) are determined for individual worms. Percent inhibition of motility is calculated by dividing the MMUs of the treated worms by the control average MMUs, subtracting the value from 1.0, flooring the values to zero and multiplying by 100%. Videos are recorded each day, including the first day of the assay (Day 0). Compounds that inhibit worm motility can be tested in IC50 assays. Prism is used to calculate IC50 values using a non-linear regression curve fit.

Acinetobacter (1536w) 24h BTG Viability - ATCC 17978 serum,"Secondary assay for hits active against virulent XDR Acinetobacter baumannii strain HUMC1
Purpose
This is a secondary assay for hits active against virulent XDR Acinetobacter baumannii strain HUMC1. A. baumannii infections, such as nosocomial pneumonia and bacteremia, are a serious public concern, with drug resistant isolates a significant problem for treatment. This is an assay to identify inhibitors of viability of the Acinetobacter baumannii HUMC1 strain, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR), highly virulent clinical bloodstream isolate. HUMC1 has been well characterized in mouse models of infection by the Spellberg lab (USC), facilitating follow up of screen hits in vivo. This screen is carried out in defined cell culture medium, mimicking in vivo growth conditions of the bacteria during infection.
Protocol
Compounds are acoustically transferred via Echo into 1536-well white plates (20 uM for primary screen and 40 uM top concentration for dose-response). Overnight cultures of bacteria are subcultured, diluted in assay media (a defined cell culture medium with high concentration of normal mouse serum), and dispensed into plates. Following a 24 hour incubation with compounds of interest, BacTiter-Glo Luminescent Microbial Cell Viability Assay is used to measure bacterial viability.

Helminth: B. malayi microfilariae (6 Day),"Brugia pahangi worm motility assay
Purpose
At the University of California at San Francisco, adult female Brugia pahangi worms are used in the primary screens to identify a macrofilaricidal candidate. Adult female Brugia are initially screened in quadruplicate in 24 well plates at a single concentration from 1-10?Ç¬µM. Worms treated with 1% DMSO only are used as controls. Worms are kept in a 37?Ç¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay. Worm motility (phenotypic screening) is assessed on Day 0 (the day worms are treated with compound), Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Day 6 using an imaging system called The Worminator. Mean movement units (worms moving are assessed as pixels displaced per second) generated from The Worminator on Day 3 and Day 6 are converted into % inhibitions of worm motility compared to controls treated with 1% DMSO only. A compound hit is defined as one that inhibits the motility of the adult female worm ?¢‚Ä?¬• 75% by Day 3 of the assay. If a compound inhibits motility of the worms consistently in at least two assays at single concentrations, an IC50 is performed using a 6-point serial dilution starting at 30 ¬µM. IC50s are calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Protocol
Based on Bulman CA, Bidlow CM, Lustigman S, Cho-Ngwa F, Williams D, Rasc?É¬?n, Jr AA, et al. (2015) Repurposing Auranofin as a Lead Candidate for Treatment of Lymphatic Filariasis and Onchocerciasis. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 9(2): e0003534 with modifications for ReFrame screen Drug screening of adult Brugia worms in vitro Adult female Brugia pahangi were shipped from Univ. of Missouri-Columbia and assayed using methods described by Marcellino et al. (2012). Individual females are placed in each well of a 24-well plate with media (RPMI-1640 with 25 mMHEPES, 2.0 g/L NaHCO3, 5% heat inactivated FBS, and 1X Antibiotic/Antimycotic solution). Worms are transfered to new 24-well plates upon arrival with 500 ?é¬ºL of media per well. Initial ReFrame compound screening is conducted at 3 ?é¬ºM per compound, and 1% DMSO is used as a negative control. All drugs are dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) stock solutions are stored at -20?Ç¬?C. Four worms were used as replicates for each concentration and worm plates are kept in a 37?Ç¬?C, 5% CO2 incubator for the duration of the assay except during motility readings. To determine the effect of a compound on worm motility, individual worm movements are counted as the number of pixels displaced per second by each worm in each well using the Worminator (see Marcellino C, et al. (2012) WormAssay: A Novel Computer Application for Whole-Plate Motion-based Screening of Macroscopic Parasites. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6(1): e1494. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001494).

Male Contraceptive Screen (Acrosome),"Secondary assay. High-throughput screen for male contraceptive targeting the sperm acrosome reaction

Purpose
The Gates Foundation has identified the need for a male contraceptive. We have developed a dual readout phenotypic assay to screen for sperm function: 1) Multiple sperm motility parameters are measured using high-throughput live cell microscopy and cell tracking; 2) the status of the acrosome (a sperm specific Golgi-derived organelle) is measured using high-throughput flow cytometry. 
The assays are in 384-well format and because they run sequentially this leads to a massive increase in throughput as compared to previous attempts in human sperm drug screening and allows for very efficient use of donor sample material. The assay is fully automated, flexible (screen for increased and decreased motility, acrosome agonists or antagonists) and extendible (e.g. for Ca2+ measurements). Furthermore, we have developed automated data analysis workflows to track sperm cells (motility assessment) and to gate sperm population (acrosome assessment).  

Protocol
Compounds are pre-spotted onto 384w black clear bottom microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer 6007550) at 6.25 uM for primary screen and 10uM top concentration for dose response. Human sperm from pooled donors is prepared, diluted, and dispensed 20uL into assay pre-spotted plates. Controls is added to columns 23/24. The plates are incubated for 10 minute at 37C and moved to CV7000 for fast imaging to look for sperm motility. The plates are then removed and stain and control are added for the acrosome reaction. The plates are incubated and moved to iQue screener for flow cytometry. Both data sets are processed using custom informatics solution.

HTS for Tryptophpanyl-tRNA Synthetase Inhibitor Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis ,"Primary screen for inhibition of the formation of reaction intermediate Trp-AMP. TrpRS is an essential enzyme in Mtb.
Purpose
The TrpRS biochemical screen targets the essential enzyme of Mtb for potential hits that met criteria and has favorable pharmacological profile. TrpRS reaction proceeds through activation of tryptophan by ATP to form a Trp-AMP intermediate that is enclosed in TrpRS enzyme complex when tRNA substrate is absent. 7-azatrptophan (7AW) is a mimic of Trp; it can bind to the amino acid pocket of TrpRS and form 7AW-AMP product. The formed 7AW-AMP and TrpRS complex has detectable fluorescent emission. A compound that slows down the real time kinetics of 7AW-AMP formation, should inhibit the TrpRS reaction with natural substrates. This enzyme assay is validated with TrpRS natural product inhibitor, indolmycin (IND).
Protocol
Echo compound and control (10uM for primary screen. 12.5uM of Indolmycin for inhibitor control). Dispense 3uL of reagent 1 (5uM TrpRS enzyme, 3 unit/mL of pyrophosphotase, 1mM TCEP, 0.1 mg/mL BSA in Hepes buffer). Incubate 15 minute at RT.

Drug discovery on Pathogenic Balamuthia mandrillaris.,"Balamuthia mandrillaris (CDC;V039, ATCC 50209) - Mandrill isolate, San Diego, CA, 1986. Phenotypic luminescence screening to identify novel molecules of interest.
Purpose
Balamuthia species cause a >95% fatal brain disease known as Balamuthia Amoebic Encephalitis (BAE) and also cutaneous lesions. Current therapeutics are not effective as they were never optimized as amoebacidal drugs. They are currently used because they have been identified to have some level of activity against these opportunistic parasites. Balamuthia has been found to encyst within tissues, being further problematic in the treatment of this disease. Identification of new drugs and or scaffolds would significantly improve the field for research and or treatments. No large drug screening methodology has previously been developed due to long doubling times of this parasite and the difficulty in axenic culture adaptation. We are one of a handful of labs in the world to be able to axenically culture this organism and expand cultures to be able to do high throughput screening. 
Protocol
Calibr plates will be prespotted with drug and sent frozen to UGA. Plates will be allowed to thaw at room temperature overnight. Plates will be centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 minute. Using the Biomek NXP 40 µl of 1x105 cells/ml B. mandrillaris will be seeded into the 384 well white, TC treated plates (Corning 3570 flat bottom) and incubated for 72 hours. At the 72 hour time point 10 µl of Promega's CellTiter-Glo 2.0 will be added to every well. Plates will be shaken for 2 minutes to induce cell lysis and be allowed to sit for 10 minutes to stabilise the luminescent signal.

"Calibr ReFrame Library Screen against, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) 757","Host-directed phenotypic screen to identify small molecule therapeutics that regulate intracellular bacterial number
Purpose
RAW264.7 murine macrophages seeded in 384 well plates are pre-treated with the compounds from the Calibr Reframe library for two hours and then infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae 757 (1 MOI). After four hours post –infection, gentamycin (50 µg/ml) is added to kill extracellular bacteria. After eight hours post infection, cells are fixed, washed, stained with appropriate bacteria specific primary antibody and fluorescent tagged secondary antibody and images are acquired using the Opera imaging system.  The acapella software is then used to detect and quantify internalized and cell associated bacteria and mammalian cells. To determine percent of bacterial infection inhibition and cytotoxicity, the Acapella generated cell data is imported to Spotfire. The primary screen is performed at a single concentration of 5 µM in two replicate plates. Only those plates that pass the robust Z’ of > 0.3 are analyzed. Compounds that show ? 50% inhibition in bacterial number and ? 20% loss in cell number are considered as hits. Appropriate down selected hits are then evaluated in dose response studies to determine the potency (EC50) and cytotoxicity (CC50). 
Protocol
RAW264.7 murine macrophages are seeded in a 384 well imaging plate (30 µl media). After 24 hours, cells are pre-treated with the compounds (5 µM final concentration) or DMSO in control wells (? 0.5% final concentration) for 2 hours. After two hours of incubation with the compounds, the cells are infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae 757 (1 MOI, 10 µl). To kill the extracellular bacteria, gentamycin (50 µg/ml, 5 µl) is added four hours post Kp infection. At eight hours post infection, cells are fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours. The plates are then washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and then macrophages are permeabilized and blocked for one hour with DPBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA. To detect bacteria, infected cells are incubated for 1 hr with the antibody against K. pneumoniae 757 (PA1-7226). After subsequent washing and incubation for 1 hr with anti-rabbit Daylight 488 secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer), the cells are stained with Hoechst nuclear dye (Invitrogen H3570, 1 mg/ml in PBS) and CellMask Deep Red dye (Invitrogen H32721, 5 mg/ml in PBS) for host cell cytoplasmic staining. The automated image acquisition is performed using an Opera QEHS confocal system (Perkin Elmer) and images analyzed using Acapella software. A compound that exhibits a ? 50% inhibition/reduction in bacterial number and ? 20% loss in cell number is considered a hit and then further evaluated in dose response studies.
Readout
Immunofluorescence 
Detection Method
to quantitate intracellular bacteria, acapella’s spot detection algorithm is used to detect and quantify internalized and cell associated bacteria. bacteria are detected as spots in a specified search region (wholecell) having a higher intensity than its surroundings. to separate the spatial noise peaks and other artifacts, all spots detected initially are regarded as spot candidates. spot candidates are then separated as ‘‘classified spots’’ based on two parameters. 1. contrast (i.e. contrast between the maximum intensity and the local background intensity near the spot candidate) and 2. spot-to-cell intensity (i.e. the ratio between the maximum intensity of the spot candidate and the average intensity of the cell to which the spot object belongs). the spot detection analyses results in various properties of spots and host cells as described elsewhere [kota 2013]. ‘‘classified spots’’, ‘‘number of spots per cell’’ and ‘‘integrated spot signal per cellular signal local background subtracted, over the whole searchregion’’ and ‘cell number’’ parameters are used for further analysis.
equations for signal-to-noise ratio, percent coefficient of variation, and z? values, as defined by (zhang et al 1999) are used for data analyses. the robustness of the assay is determined by calculating the z’ on a per plate basis (z’ = (1- (3 x stdev of signalmax (neutral/infection only control) + 3 x stdev signalmin (inhibitor/no infection control))/abs(mean signalmax – mean of signalmin)). only those plates that have a z’ >0.3 are considered for data analysis. to determine percent of bacterial infection inhibition and cytotoxicity, the acapella generated cell data is imported to spotfire (visual analysis statistical software, perkin elmer inc., ma). the formula that is used to calculate % bacterial inhibition and cytotoxicity is 
100 - {(compound treated bacterial or cell no/neutral control)*100}. in the primary screen, a compound is considered a hit if it shows in both the replicate plates, a ? 50% inhibition of bacterial counts and ? 20% loss in cell number compared to infected controls. 

Detection Reagents
Primary rabbit polyclonal antibody PA1-7226 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and secondary goat anti rabbit Daylight 488 antibody (1:500) are used to detect bacteria. The cells are stained with Hoechst dye (Invitrogen H3570, 1 mg/ml in PBS) and CellMask Deep Red dye (Invitrogen H32721, 5 mg/ml in PBS) to detect host cell nucleus and cytoplasm respectively.

Dengue Virus antivirals,"Identification of chemical compounds inhibiting DENV-2 replication
Purpose
Antigen-antibody reactions are one of the most specific biological interactions. Antibody based detection of viral antigen represents one of the best ways to confirm viral infection. We use this method as a specific, scalable and quantifiable technique to measure viral infection. Cells (of choice) are treated with compounds at predetermined conditions (concentration, time, sequence) followed by challenge with the virus. After the predetermined time window, when sufficient viral protein is detectable, cells are fixed. Either fluorescently conjugated antibodies specific to viral protein/s or specific primary antibody followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibody are used to detect viral antigen. Fluorescent DNA or cell membrane binding dyes are used to get an estimate of total cell numbers. Cells stained with these reagents are imaged on an automated microscope. Image analysis software is used to count the number of cells that are positive for viral antigen (a direct correlate of infection), level of fluorescence (bright or dim: another parameter indicative of the level of replication) and total cell numbers. Comparison of these parameters among treated and untreated groups gives the estimate of compound activity. If different doses for treatment of cells are used, dose response curves can be generated that enable estimation of IC-50s and IC-90s.
Protocol
In the primary screen, 2,250 Huh-7.5 cells resuspended in 40 µl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS are plated in 384-well plates preliminary spotted with chemical compounds at a final concentration of 10 µM. 16 hours post seeding, 10 µl of diluted DENV-2 (MOI=5) are added to each well. 24 hours after the addition of the virus, cells are fixed by addition of 50 µl of 8% PFA to each well for 30 minutes. An immunofluorescence targeting DENV-2 envelope protein, followed by nuclei staining will be performed in order to quantify the percentage of infected cells. Briefly, cells will be permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100. After blocking 30 min with PBS supplemented with 3% BSA, cells will be incubated 1h with primary antibody anti-DENV envelope mouse (1 µg/ml). After two washing steps with PBS, cells will be incubated another hour with anti-mouse Alexa488 secondary antibody (1/2500 dilution) and DAPI. After two additional washed with PBS, cells will be finally resuspended in 25 µl of PBS and plates will be sealed with aluminium foils.

HRSV is a major cause for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Purpose
hRSV is a globally distributed viral pathogen causing respiratory disease in humans.
The high throughput cell-based HTS-system employs a recombinant hRSV-A strain encoding GFP fluorescent protein as reporter. Since the GFP gene is an integral part of the modified RSV genome, GFP fluorescence reflects efficiency of RSV infection and replication. A human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) is infected with hRSV-A_GFP viruses in presence of test compounds. Subsequently, GFP-fluorescence is quantified. The intensity of GFP fluorescence reflects RSV infection efficiency and is used as a marker to quantify antiviral efficacy of test compounds. In parallel, cell viability is examined by use of an MTT test. The MTT test examines metabolic activity of cultured cells. This information is used to distinguish between compounds with antiviral activity and cytotoxic molecules which destroy cells and therefore indirectly inhibit virus infection.
Protocol
HEp-2 cells are seeded in a clear bottom 384-well plates. Compounds are added together with the virus (MOI 0.5) 24h post seeding. Synagis, an antibody against the pre-fusion hRSV F-protein, is used as an inhibitory control and same volume of DMSO is used as the neutral control.

Screening for Candida albicans biofilm inhibitors,"This is a screen for inhibitors of C. albicans biofilm formation. Fungal cells are added to wells of microtiter plates containing pre-spotted individual compounds, and the extent of biofilm inhibition is measured after incubation.
Purpose
There is an urgent need for new antifungal agents. Candida albicans is the most common causative agent of fungal infections, with candidiasis now representing the 3rd leading nosocomial infection in the US. Formation of biofilms complicates treatment due to the intrinsic resistance of cells within biofilms against most clinically-used antifungal drugs. The primary screen will utilize 384-well microtiter plates for C. albicans biofilm formation, in search for compounds with biofilm-inhibitory activity. For secondary/confirmatory experiments, we test the hit compounds directly in dose-response assays.
Protocol
Compounds and controls are pre-spotted onto 384 well microtiter plate at 5ÂµM for primary screen. Once plates are received at UTSA, a suspension of C. albicans cells in 30 microliters of media is added to each well, and plates incubated at 37 dgrees for 24 hrs to allow for biofilm formation. After washings, XTT is added to estimate the extent of biofilm formation and plates are read in a microtiter plate reader.

"Screening for modulators for FLYC1, mechanically activated ion channel ","Identification the modulators of the FLYC1, mechanically activated ion channels, by Ca2+ recording with FLIPR
Purpose
Venus flytrap responds to touch by rapid leaf movements triggered by touch-induced action potentials to capture animals for nutrient acquisition. We identify the FLYC1 ion channels required for the touch response in Venus flytrap that are preferentially expressed in trigger hairs. In order to find agonist of the channel, we plan to use the Calibr ReFrame library (1200 compounds) for high throughput cellular fluorescent and luminescent screening assays. Using the FLIPR Tetra system, HEK cells expressing Yellow Fluorescent proteins whose bio-fluoresce is quenched upon the addition of anionic compounds, as well as the trans-membrane Ion Channel FlyC1, will be seeded with 20,000cells per well in 384 well plates. The fluoresce of the compounds will be recorded in live. 
Protocol
Using the FLIPR Tetra system, HEK cells expressing Yellow Fluorescent proteins whose bio-fluoresce is quenched upon addition of anionic compounds as well as the trans-membrane Ion Channel FlyC1 were seeded with 20,000 cells per well in 384 well plates. The fluoresce of the compounds were recorded in live time before and after the addition of the ReFrame library to record the change in fluorescent illumination upon the addition of the compound. Compounds are pre-spotted onto white 384 well microtiter plate. During FLIPR experiment, we add 20ul directly into the each well of cell plates that covered by 20ul of buffer. So, the final working compound concentration will be 10uM, and this requires the pre-spotted compound concentration is 20uM.

Screen for Naegleria growth inhibitors using CellTiterGlo,"Secondary assay: Identification of growth inhibitors of Naegleria fowleri via luminescence cell-based assay
Purpose
Naegleria fowleri causes severe Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) among children with recent recreational fresh water exposure. PAM kills over 97% of infected people. PAM results from water containing N. fowleri entering the nasal cavity, followed by migration of the amebae to the brain. Within the brain, N. fowleri causes extensive inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis. The time from initial exposure to onset of illness is usually 5-7 days but may be as early as 24 h. In our screen we incubated the N. fowleri trophozoites with the compounds for 48 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the DMSO-treated controls.
Protocol
The compounds were screened against Naegleria fowleri following an ATP-bioluminescence based assay for cell growth and survival. For 8-point dose response study, 50 uL of N. fowleri (5,000 trophozoites) were added to plated compounds to yield final concentrations spanning from 0.078 uM-10 uM. Negative controls in the screen plates contained 0.5% DMSO and positive controls contained 50 uM of amphotericin B. Assay plates were incubated for 48 h at 37?C and at the end of incubation 25 uL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were added in each well of the 96-well plates to induce cell lysis. The resulting ATP-bioluminescence of the trophozoites was measured at room temperature using an Envision plate reader from PerkinElmer.

Screen for Acanthamoeba growth inhibitors using CellTiterGlo,"Secondary Assay: Identification of growth inhibitors of Acanthamoeba castellanii via luminescence cell-based assay
Purpose
Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living amebae widely spread in the environment that can act as opportunistic pathogens and cause deadly human infections. Acanthamoeba spp. can enter either via respiratory tract or broken skin and invade the CNS, causing Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE), which is more common in immunosuppressed individuals. Acanthamoeba spp. can also cause amebic keratitis, a severe eye infection among contact lens wearers. In our screen we incubated the A. castellanii trophozoites with the compounds for 48 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the DMSO-treated controls.
Protocol
The compounds were screened against Acanthamoeba castellanii following an ATP-bioluminescence based assay for cell growth and survival. For 8-point dose response study, 50 uL of A. castellanii (2,500 trophozoites) were added to plated compounds to yield final concentrations spanning from 0.078 uM-10 uM. Negative controls in the screen plates contained 0.5% DMSO and positive controls contained 50 uM of chlorhexidine. Assay plates were incubated for 48 h at 28?C and at the end of incubation 25 uL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were added in each well of the 96-well plates to induce cell lysis. The resulting ATP-bioluminescence of the trophozoites was measured at room temperature using an Envision plate reader from PerkinElmer.

Screen for Balamuthia growth inhibitors,"Secondary Assay: Identification of growth inhibitors of Balamuthia mandrillaris via luminescence cell-based assay
Purpose
Balamuthia mandrillaris is an opportunistic pathogen, generally entering through broken skin or through the respiratory pathway, where it can cause lesions. Infection of the brain is thought to occur secondarily from these sites after penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and can cause GAE with a mortality rate up to 95%. In our screen we incubated the B. mandrillaris trophozoites with the compounds for 72 hours and assessed viability using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The antiparasitic activity is calculated based on the reduction of luminescence signal compared to the neutral control, DMSO.
Protocol
The compounds were screened against Balamuthia mandrillaris following an ATP-bioluminescence based assay for cell growth and survival. For 8-point dose response study, 30 uL of B. mandrillaris (3,000 trophozoites) were added to plated compounds to yield final concentrations spanning from 0.26 uM - 33 uM. Negative controls in the screen plates contained 0.5% DMSO. Assay plates were incubated for 72 h at 37?C B. mandrillaris and at the end of incubation 20 uL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) were added in each well of the 96-well plates to induce cell lysis. The resulting ATP-bioluminescence of the trophozoites was measured at room temperature using a Tecan plate reader from PerkinElmer.

Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-proteins in multiplex,"A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding.
Purpose
Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful.
This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.  

Protocol
Bead sets (4µM) that have been pre-coupled with GST~GTPase constructs overnight are washed to remove unbound proteins and are kept on ice until use. Assay plates with pre-spotted compounds (10µM for the primary screen, 100µM top concentration for the concentration-dependent analyses) and DMSO controls are assembled by adding 5µL of assay buffer followed by 5µL of the coupled bead set mixtures. The final concentration of each bead set is 200 beads/µL. Compounds are incubated with GTPase~coupled beads for 30 minutes followed by the addition 100 nL of Bodipy-GTP to a final concentration of 10 nL followed by incubation for 1 hour. Assay plates are sampled using a high-throughput flow cytometry platform that delivers air-separated samples to a flow cytometer. Data from individual assay plates are acquired as single files that are subsequently parsed into individual bins with associated fluorescence signatures.

Bodipy-GTP fluorescence associated with each individual bead set is measured after one hour of incubation. Positive and negative control wells are used to calculate Zâ€™ statistics and active hit compounds are selected based on % signal deviation from control well averages.

Macrophage cytotoxicity,"Secondary assay: A high content microscopy assay to determine cytotoxicity of drugs against macrophages
Purpose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, exists in a complex set of environments both intracellularly and extracellularly in the host. Most drug screening for tuberculosis has been performed on extracellular bacteria. We are screening for drugs that inhibit M. tuberculosis growth inside macrophages, a primary cell type in which the bacteria reside. This is a high-content image-based assay. Total fluorescence intensity of DsRed-producing M. tuberculosis and nucleic acid-stained macrophages are readouts of growth or survival.
Protocol
RAW 264.7 cells are propagated in RMPI ( RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 2 mM Glutagro, 1 mM sodium pyruvate medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 37Â°C, 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells are infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Rv DREAM8 strain which constitutively expresses DsRed) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 overnight. Compounds are diluted in RPMI-1640, 5% FBS with Glutagro and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Infected RAW 264.7 cells are harvested with Accumax solution, washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular bacilli and resuspended in RPMI-1640 with Glutagro and sodium pyruvate (no FBS). Infected cells are  seeded in 384-well plates containing compounds at 3.3 x 10^3 cells per well, resulting in a final assay concentration of 2.5% FBS. After a 72 hour incubation period, SYBR Green I dye is diluted in PBS and added to a final concentration of 5x to stain macrophage nuclei. Cells are imaged on an ImageXpress Micro with a 4x objective. Macrophage nuclei are imaged using a FITC filter set and M. tuberculosis are imaged using a Texas Red filter set. This method has been published: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316303619?via%3Dihub

Repurposing Medicinal Drugs for Human Adenovirus (ADV) ,"Infections with human adenovirus (ADV) can cause life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed patients, in particular in children receiving a stem cell transplant. There are no good drugs with broad activity against different human adenovirus species. We aim to identify small molecule inhibitors that show broad activity against different adenovirus species. We will screen the ReFrame library with a recombinant human adenovirus type 5 carrying an mCherry marker. Confirmed â€˜hitsâ€™ will subsequently be tested against clinical ADV isolates representing different ADV types and species, taking advantage of the ADV strain collection in the Institute of Virology of Hannover Medical School, which hosts the German National Reference Centre for Adenoviruses. 
Purpose
Antigen-antibody reactions are one of the most specific biological interactions. Antibody based detection of viral antigen represents one of the best ways to confirm viral infection. We use this method as a specific, scalable and quantifiable technique to measure viral infection. Cells (of choice) are treated with compounds at predetermined conditions (concentration, time, sequence) followed by challenge with the virus. After the predetermined time window, when sufficient viral protein is detectable, cells are fixed. Either fluorescently conjugated antibodies specific to viral protein/s or specific primary antibody followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibody are used to detect viral antigen. Fluorescent DNA or cell membrane binding dyes are used to get an estimate of total cell numbers. Cells stained with these reagents are imaged on an automated microscope. Image analysis software is used to count the number of cells that are positive for viral antigen (a direct correlate of infection), level of fluorescence (bright or dim: another parameter indicative of the level of replication) and total cell numbers. Comparison of these parameters among treated and untreated groups gives the estimate of compound activity. If different doses for treatment of cells are used, dose response curves can be generated that enable estimation of IC-50s and IC-90s.

Viral Inhibition screen for DENV transmission blocking molecules (U4.4 cells),"High Throughput Screening for DENV transmission blocking molecules in U4.4_DENV1 stable cell line (mosquito cell line)
Purpose
We aim to screen for molecules that target mosquito host cell factors playing a role in the viral replication, consequently inhibiting the replication of virus in the mosquito. The screen will be carried out in Aedes albopictus U4.4 cells (Argo knockout) expressing DENV1 replicon with a Nanoluciferase based reporter. The U4.4-DENV1 replicon cell line has been stably and successfully maintained for over 30 passages without significant loss of reporter signal. Screen will be done on a 384-well plate using cryopreserved cells, frozen at the same passage. This will save time on culturing cells throughout the screen and will reduce any variations that may be caused due to different cell passages. Luminescence generated by Nanoluciferase will be the read-out for viral replication inhibition in this assay.

Development of preclinical candidates for the treatment of NTM disease - M. abscessus Bamboo,"In vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify small molecule inhibitors with activity against both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species, ideally also active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Purpose
This is an in vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify new orally bioavailable preclinical development candidate compounds for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease caused by both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species. NTM are diverse and ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly being identified globally in association with serious, usually opportunistic, infections in humans. M. abscessus, one of the most commonly identified NTM species responsible for severe respiratory, skin and mucosal infections in humans, is intrinsically resistant to available antibiotics, underscoring the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NTM lung disease.
Protocol
Mid-log (OD600 = 0.4-0.6) cultures of M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium are diluted to OD600 = 0.05 prior to incubation in the presence of the compounds at 37Â°C with shaking at 110 rpm for 3 and 4 days, respectively. Following incubation, percentage growth inhibition is calculated by normalization to Day 0 data and DMSO negative controls as reference. Compounds displaying >85% growth inhibition against both M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 species are followed up in secondary dose-response screens to identify those with the most potent activity against both organisms. Following selection of the most promising candidate compounds, carried out in consultation with Calibr, further in vitro and in vivo characterization is carried out to facilitate target deconvolution and to determine efficacy in the mouse model of NTM infection.

XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae amikacin potentiation in the presence of a fixed concentration of amikacin ,"Identification of potentiators of amikacin against XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae via growth inhibition assay
Purpose
The goal of this screen is to identify compounds in the ReFRAME library that potentiate the efficacy of the aminoglycoside amikacin against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) K. pneumoniae. Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are important therapeutic options for treating nosocomial Gram-negative infections, but resistant isolates are increasingly reported. Mechanistically, aminoglycosides have the dual advantage of inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby decreasing the expression of bacterial toxins and resistance-mediating enzymes, and permeabilizing the outer membrane. The 384-well screen identifies inhibitors of globally prevalent XDR K. pneumoniae strains, either through potentiation of amikacin and/or direct growth inhibition. This screen is performed following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines, which recommends using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference methods for drug susceptibility testing (ISO 20776-1:2019). These guidelines were adapted to 384-well format to accommodate high-throughput screening and primary screening at single concentration.

Small Molecule Inducer of MDS Stem Cell Differentiation,"Primary CD34+ stem cells isolated from bone marrow of MDS patient or MDS cell line will be used for this assay. GlyA will be used as a marker of erythrocyte lineage differentiation. 


Purpose
In MDS, some of the cells in the bone marrow are abnormal (dysplastic) and have problems making new blood cells. Many of the blood cells formed by these bone marrow cells are defective. Defective cells often die earlier than normal cells, and the body also destroys some abnormal blood cells, leaving the person without enough normal blood cells. Currently, the therapeutic treatment for MDS is limited to chemotherapy therapies or epigenetic modulators and response rate is fairly low. Due to the cause of MDS is primarily defect in cell differentiation, strategy that alters MDS stem cell differentiation potential with small molecule holds promise to treat MDS disease.


Protocol
In screening with primary MDS cells, CD34+ selection from bone marrow biopsy of MDS patient will be performed to isolate MDS stem cell.  MDS stem cells will be cultured in expansion media for 4 days and switch to myeloid/erythroid differentiation media for another 3 days. Cells will be seeded at 2000 cells/well in 50 uL differentiation media and exposed to compound at 2 uM for 4 days. This is an imaging based assay, by the end of day 4, cells will be stained with anti GlyA antibody and scanned with cellomics. Increase in percentage of GlyA+ cells are expected with hit compounds. In screening to MDS cell line (similar to primary MDS cells), increase in GlyA+ cells are expected with hits. Different than with primary cells, this assay is a flow cytometry based assay and the cells will be seeded at 20,000 cells/well in 50 uL.

Screening for PLD3 enzyme inhibitors,"PLD3 and PLD4 are endolysosomal exonucleases that appear to behave as negative regulators of nucleic acid sensing. Inhibitors may be useful as immunological adjuvants for vaccine or cancer applications.
Purpose
The screen we have developed has been assessed using the LOPAC library. Our assay relies on the exonuclease activity of PLD3 and PLD4. A short oligonucleotide carrying a fluorescein adduct on one base along with a fluorescence quencher (Iowa Black) on the 3 prime end emits enhanced fluorescence upon digestion by PLD3 or PLD4. Inhibitors will suppress this signal. We plan to introduce into plates that are pre-dotted with compounds to be screened a buffer containing enzyme but no substrate. After a 15 min room temperature incubation, the substrate will be added in an equal volume of butter and the reaction allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37oC. FITC fluorescence is then read. We propose to use PLD3 at 2 nM, PLD4 at 100 nM, and substrate at 2 uM. Final concentration of the ReFrame compound inhibitors will be 2 uM. 
Protocol
Clear 384-well plates are spotted with 10 nl compounds (final conc 2 uM). Then 5 ul enzyme in 1X buffer is added and the plates pre-incubated with compunds for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 5 ul 1X buffer containing fluorogenic substrate (4 uM) is added, and cultured at 37oC for 2 h. One copy of the spotted library will be incubated with 2 uM PLD3, substrate and its optimal buffer. A second copy of the spotted library will be incubated with PLD4, substrate along with its buffer. Assays will be carried out simultaneously to identify selective inhibitors of each isoform.

Toxicity screen on Hit compounds for DENV transmission blocking molecules,"Secondary assay for A00378. High Throughput luciferase interference screening for Hit compounds from the primary screen on U4.4_DENV1 stable cell line (mosquito cell line)

Purpose
We aim to screen the hit compounds from the primary screen (done previously) to identify the false positives. For this purpose, cytotoxicity assay will be used as the deselection assay. The screen will be carried out in Aedes albopictus U4.4 cells (Argo knockout) expressing DENV1 replicon with a Nanoluciferase based reporter. The U4.4-DENV1 replicon cell line has been stably and successfully maintained for over 30 passages without significant loss of reporter signal. Screen will be done on a 384-well plate using cryopreserved cells, frozen at the same passage. This will save time on culturing cells throughout the screen and will reduce any variations that may be caused due to different cell passages. Fluorescent signal generated by conversion of Resazurin to resoflurin will be used as the measure of viability of the cells.
Toxicity assay will be carried out as a dose response screen after the primary single point viral inhibition screen. 
Protocol
8 point dose response screen (Hits only): Prespotted assay plates including the positive and negative controls on solid black 384- wells plate ( Catalog number: Greiner Bio-one, 781086). X nl of compound to a final concentration ranging from 10 ÂµM- 3 nM is added to each plate in a final volume of 40 Âµl.
U4.4_DENV1 cryopreserved cells are added to each well (5000 cells/40Âµl). Plates are incubated at 26Â°C for 48 hours. 20Âµl of Resazurin substrate is added to each well and fluorescence is measured after 24 hours incubation at 26Â°C.

HTS screening for MEF2C transcriptional activators in hiPSC-derived neurons,"Luciferase-based screening of MEF2C transcriptional activity, using hiPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells. 
Purpose
Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) is a family of transcription factors that play a role in development, cell differentiation, and organogenesis. Our group previously discovered the Mef2c gene and showed that heterozygosity or brain-specific knockout using a Nestin-Cre driver produces mice with immature electrophysiological network properties, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, and behavioral deficits reminiscent of ASD, and Rett syndrome (RTT) in particular. Recent human genetic studies have established an association between MEF2C mutations and a form of ASD now known as MEF2C Haploinsufficiency Syndrome (MHS). Moreover, MEF2C reportedly functions as a coregulator of ASD-associated gene networks, We have generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from MHS patients, and generated neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Activating the normal copy of MEF2C, may prevent some of the deficiencies observed using this â€œdisease-in-a-dishâ€ disease model. Since MEF2C is a coregulator of ASD-associated gene networks gene in neurodevelopment exerting transcriptional control over many other critical ASD candidate genes, our approach may lead to personalized therapies for multiple forms of ASD.
Protocol
hiPSCs are differentiated to NPCs using the dual SMAD inhibition protocol. The NPCs are cultures in high density in DMEM/F12 supplemented with BSA, N2 and B27. The cells are cultures on the following substrate: PEI, PDLO and Laminin.
Cells are transfected with Luciferase-MEF2C reporter plasmid using electroporation method (Nucleofector, Lonza stem cell transfection kit). 
First, Compounds are added to each well at a final concentration of 10uM. Then, cells are added to the 1536 wells, at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well, with a final volume of 5uL. 24 hours later, Luciferase activity is measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase kit (Promega).

Day -1: Coat plates with 6uL of Ornithine
Day 0: Bluecat Wash 4x with water and add 6uL of Laminin (can store for up to a week)

The compounds reverse the high palmitate-induced beta cell dysfunction,"This is cell-based phenotypic screen using Endobeta C cells carrying Nano-Luc. This assay will identify the drug candidates that reverse high palmitate-induced beta cell dysfunction.
Purpose
Diabetes is a polygenetic and chronic disease affecting approximately 346 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled diabetes results in hyperglycemia, which overtime leads to serious damages to many organs. More than 90% diabetic population have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The classic pathogenesis of T2DM involves insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, marked by impaired glucose stimulated insulin section. Only 40-50% of individuals with insulin resistance progress to T2DM. The pivotal defect in those who progress is that pancreatic beta cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance, become dysfunctional and eventually die. Thus, pancreatic beta cell dysfunction is a key step in the progression from metabolic impairments to a disease state. 
Protocol
Briefly, EndobetaC cells, a human pancreatic beta cell line, were labelled with nano-luciferase. EndobetaC nano-Luc cells were plated on 384-well plate and treated with compound plus 2 mM palmitate for 72 hours. After washing, the cells will be treated with 2 mM and 20 mM glucose respectively. The supernatant will be used for luciferase-based assay.

XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae amikacin potentiation in the absence of amikacin,"Secondary screen for A00385 Identification of potentiators of amikacin against XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae via growth inhibition assay
Purpose
The goal of this screen is to identify compounds in the ReFRAME library that potentiate the efficacy of the aminoglycoside amikacin against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) K. pneumoniae. Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are important therapeutic options for treating nosocomial Gram-negative infections, but resistant isolates are increasingly reported. Mechanistically, aminoglycosides have the dual advantage of inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby decreasing the expression of bacterial toxins and resistance-mediating enzymes, and permeabilizing the outer membrane. The 384-well screen identifies inhibitors of globally prevalent XDR K. pneumoniae strains, either through potentiation of amikacin and/or direct growth inhibition. This screen is performed following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines, which recommends using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference methods for drug susceptibility testing (ISO 20776-1:2019). These guidelines were adapted to 384-well format to accommodate high-throughput screening and primary screening at single concentration.
Protocol
Compounds will be pre-spotted onto 384 well microtiter plate (columns 3-22) at 20 ÂµM for primary screen and 40 ÂµM top concentration for dose response together with a fixed concentration of amikacin corresponding to approximately 1/4 x MIC against the XDR K. pneumoniae strains. 5 x 105 CFU/mL of bacteria in Cation-Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (CAMHB) are then dispensed to wells in columns 1-23 to a final volume of 50 Âµl per well. CAMHB only is added to wells in column 24. Control conditions are bacteria only (16 wells, column 1), bacteria plus amikacin at 1/4x MIC (16 wells, columns 2), bacteria plus positive drug control apramycin (2 times 8-pt dose-response, column 23) and CAMHB only wells (16 wells, column 24). Plate are incubated for 18h at 37Â°C and optical density at 600 nm (OD600) read with a multimode plate reader.

Identification of antivirals inhibiting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"Secondary assay for Identification potential antivirals by screening the ReFRAME collection using SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 (Isolate USA-WA1/2020) in Vero E6 cells, using an IF readout 
Purpose
Vero E6 cells are monkey cells highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunofluorescence targeting SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), allows identifying compounds blocking SARS-CoV-2, through a direct readout. Differently from an indirect-CPE assay, IF allows identifying compounds directly affecting the accumulation of the viral protein NP, also monitoring cytotoxicity through nuclear count. More specifically, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the window for this assay is bigger than for a corresponding CPE-dependent assay, making the system more sensitive and reliable, especially for dose-response validation and calculation of IC50. 
Protocol
3,000 Vero E6 cells resuspended in 40 µl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS are plated in 384-well plates preliminary spotted with chemical compounds at a final concentration of 5 µM. 16 hours post seeding, 10 µl of diluted SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.75) are added to each well. 24 hours after the addition of the virus, cells are fixed by addition of 50 µl of 10% PFA to each well for 4 hours at room temperature. An immunofluorescence targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP, followed by nuclei staining is performed in order to quantify the percentage of infected cells. Briefly, cells are permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X100. After blocking 30 min with PBS supplemented with 3% BSA, cells are incubated 1h with primary antibody anti-NP (rabbit serum, A-G Sastre unpublished data). After two washing steps with PBS, cells are incubated another hour with anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibody (1/2000 dilution) and DAPI. After two additional washed with PBS, cells are finally resuspended in 25 µl of PBS and plates sealed with aluminum foils.
Imaging of the plates and quantification of the infection is performed using Celigo Imaging Cytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience).
Readout
The percentage of infection is calculated as the ratio of SARS-CoV-2 NP stained cells over the total amount of cells in each well. Data are normalized to the average percentage of infection of the DMSO wells within each plate. Z’ for each plate is calculated following the equation Z’ =1-[(3?c++3?c-)/(|?c+-?c-|)]; (c+:wells treated with DMSO;  c-: wells treated with APY0201). Cytotoxicity is evaluated by nuclear count and also normalized to the average cell count of the DMSO wells within each plate. Graph Pad Prism 8 is used to calculate IC50 and CC50 values using a non-linear regression curve fit.

Identification of Small Molecules that Eradicate Breast Cancer Stem Cells,"The goal of this project is to identify small molecules that eradicate breast cancer stem cells using a high-throughput, fluorescence imaging-based mammosphere formation assay. 
Purpose
Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are a subpopulation of cells within a breast tumor that drive tumor initiation, progression and recurrence. BCSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and therefore persist after treatment. Thus, to cure breast cancer, eradication of BCSCs is required. To screen for compounds that eradicate BCSCs, we have developed an automated, high-throughput, fluorescence imaging-based version of the mammosphere formation assay, a well-established method for quantifying BCSCs in cell lines and tumors. In brief, human breast cancer MCF7 cells are plated at conditions in which BCSCsâ€”but not non-BCSCs present in the cell populationâ€”are able to survive and form mammospheres, which are three-dimensional spheroids that can be detected by imaging. Compounds that prevent mammosphere formation typically also induce cell death, resulting in aggregation of dead cells in the bottom of the well. Cells are therefore stained with Hoechst 33342 (a blue fluorescent dye that stains chromatin) and propidium iodide (PI, a red fluorescent dye that stains dead cells), and the gate is adjusted to distinguish intact mammospheres (which are blue) from aggregates of dead cells (which are red/purple).
Protocol
MCF7 cells (in DME/F12 medium plus supplements) are added to each well at low density (150 cells/well) and 5 days later cells are stained with Hoechst (20 nM) and PI (50 Âµg/mL). 
Readout
Plates are imaged using the Celigo Imaging Cytometer system with the gate adjusted to distinguish intact mammospheres (which are permeable to Hoechst and are thus primarily blue with little to no detectable signal in the red channel) from aggregates of dead cells (which are permeable to both dyes and are thus primarily red/purple). We have designed the read out from the Celigo as a binary output of either normal mammosphere formation (equivalent to that of the DMSO control) as â€œ1â€ (blue) or reduced mammosphere formation as â€œ0â€ (red/purple).
Detection Method

COVID-19 C3-like protease assay,"Biochemical assay on recombinant cystine protease. Enzyme activity is determined by cleavage of a peptide with a member of a FRET quencher pair at either terminus, cleavage causes an increase in fluorescence.
Purpose
COVID-19 C3-like protease is a cystine protease with a chemotrypsin-like fold crucial to the replication of novel coronavirus COVID-19. The virus, COVID-19 has a single stranded RNA genome which is transcribed as a single polypeptide, which COVID-19 C3-like protease then cleaves into individual protein products. Inhibitors of this protease should be effective inhibitors of the viral life cycle. By screening against the recombinant enzyme we are able to find effective starting points to transfer to more complex, lower throughput viral replication assays. This assay is also a useful counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 target PLPro as they are both cystine proteases but share no similarity in their active sites.
Protocol
Plates are received pre spotted with compound (30 nL). Using a multidrop 20 uL enzyme in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) tween) is dispensed to all wells, and incubated for 60 min at RT. The assay is started with the addition of substrate in assay buffer (10 uL) using a multidrop. The enzyme is allowed to react with substrate for 60 min.

Purpose
COVID-19 S-protein facilitates entry to the host cell via interaction with the host receptor ACE2. The first stage of viral entry is the protein-protein interaction between the S-protein and ACE2 therefore inhibitors of this interaction will be useful to treat infection. The two proteins are labelled with one of the HTRF pair, terbium and Alexfluor 488/647. If the two proteins are bound upon excitation of the terbium, rather than fluorescing, energy is transferred to the alexfluor dye and light is emitted at a longer wavelength.
Protocol

SARS-CoV2 Protease Inhibitor,"Identification of SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease inhibitors by luminescence assay.
Purpose
Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the PLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This 384 well assay will identify inhibitors of the PLpro by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based cleavage reporter. The luminescence signal is dependent on cleavage by PLpro, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Cell viability is controlled by a constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter.
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2500 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls.

SARS-CoV2/VeroE6-EGFP HTS antiviral assay    ,"Screening assay for antiviral agents against SARS-CoV2, using EGFP reporter VeroE6 cells. 
Purpose
A virus-cell-based phenotypic assay with COVID-19 in a reporter cell-line (fluoresencent EGPF VeroE6 cells) will be used to assess the antiviral activity of a library of compounds. Because COVID-19 induces cell death, the detection of fluorescence of these cells after the incubation period implies they have not been killed by the virus nor succumbed due to toxicity of the compound, which is indicative of a selective antiviral inhibitor. The phenotypic assay will be performed in the fully automated Caps-It isolator system (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cmt/capsit) of the Rega Institute, KU LEUVEN. This research infrastructure has been designed to perform high-throughput phenotypic assays with viable pathogens without risking exposure of the environment or the operators around the system. After import of plates containing the pre-plated compounds and cells that have been added at the start of assay, the robot system infects the cells by adding the virus and, after incubation in the system for an appropriate period, data are automatically collected by means of fluorescence readout and microscopy. The images are processed by the software in which the high-content imaging instruments are embedded, followed by analysis in the Screener (Genedata) warehouse software platform, allowing for quickly identifying hits for further study
Protocol
A similar protocol as in Ivens, T. et al. J. Virological Methods 2005, 129, 56-63 is followed. 

VeroE6-EGFP are provided by Janssen as ""VeroE6-EGFP Cl-21 #2 02-sep-2003"". Cells are propagated in ""DMEM10%"" which is prepared by supplementing DMEM (gibco cat no 41965-039) with 10% v/v heat-inactivated FCS (Biowest S1810-500 lot S17193S1810) and 5 mL sodium bicarbonate 7.5% (Gibco 25080-060). Cells are split 1/4 twice a week. Pen-strep is added directly to the cell culture bottle during culture, but is not added during the antiviral assay.

For antiviral testing cells are detached using trypsine. For this the confluent cell monolayer in a T150 flask is first washed with DPBS, 10 mL trypsine 0.25%trypsine/EDTA is added and incubated for 1 minute. Then all trypsine is removed except for 2 mL and the cells are incubated 15 minutes at 37Â°C. The cells are then resuspended in 20 mL assay medium (DMEM 2% v/v FCS and sodium bicarbonate as above) and passed through a cell restrainer (FALCON cat no 352350). Cells are counted and diluted in assay medium to 2000 cells / 30 ÂµL. Using a multidrop C23-24 of the 384-well assay ready plates are filled with 30 ÂµL assays medium. Next 30 ÂµL of the cell suspension is added to C1-24. Plates are subsequently transferred to the Caps-It platform where 30 ÂµL of virus inoculum is added to C1-22 after which they are placed in a cell culture incubator (37Â°C, 5%CO2). On day 5 the plates analyzed by whole-well fluorescence and/or by high-content imaging. The titer of the virus inoculum is optimized in previous experiments.

Coronaviruses infect animals and humans. Several strains (SARS, SARS-2 and MERS) have recently emerged and caused epidemics or pandemics in humans.
Purpose
The high troughput cell-based HTS-system based on a 229E_GFP human Coronavirus which expresses a GFP reporter that reflects viral replication has been developed to identify anti-Coronavirus compounds. Coronaviruses infect animals and humans. Selected strains have emerged and caused epidemics or pandemics (SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2). The purpose of this HTS is it to discover pan-coronavirus antiviral compounds. To this end, an HTS will be conducted using the 229E Coronavirus strain.

COVID-19 Nsp14 Guanine-N7-methyltransferase assay,"A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay (MTase-Glo, Promega) will be utilized to measure Nsp14 methyltransferase activity.
Purpose
A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay kit (MTase-Glo, Promega) will be utilized to measure methyltransferase activity. The substrate to be methylated in the assay will be GTP, as Nsp14 has been shown to methylate the single nucleotide as efficiently as capped RNA. Nsp14 activity requires S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to act as the methyl donor, converting it to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) as it is consumed. At assay termination, the SAH reaction product is converted to ATP using kit provided reagents to measure luminescence via a standard luciferase reaction and correlated to Nsp14 activity.
Protocol
In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 500 nM Nsp14 enzyme in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 1 ÂµM SAM, is incubated with 0.1 mM GTP substrate and MTase-Glo reagent at 37Â°C for 2 hrs. Once the 10 ÂµL methyltransferase reaction is complete, 10 ÂµL of MTase-Glo detection solution is then added to all wells and incubated for an additional 30 minutes.

ReFRAME COVID-19 Cytopathic Effect,"A COVID-19 Cytopathic Effect (CPE) assay will be used to screen the ReFRAME collection at a single concentration to identify compounds with antiviral effect. Hits will be retested for concentration response to confirm activity and will be counter screened for cytotoxic effect on host cells.
Purpose
We will employ a cell based assay measuring the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the COVID-19 virus infecting Vero E6 host cells. The CPE assay is a popular and widely used assay format to screen for antiviral agents because of its ease of use in high throughput screening (HTS). In this assay, host cells die as a consequence of the virus infection. The CPE assay indirectly monitors the effect of antiviral agents acting through various molecular mechanisms by measuring the viability of host cells three days after inoculation with virus. Cell viability is assessed by measuring ATP levels using Promega’s Cell Titer Glo reagent. Anti-viral compounds are identified as those that protect the host cells from the cytopathic effect of the virus, thereby increasing viability. The viability of uninfected host cells after exposure to compounds for 72 hours is measured in a counter screen to determine and exclude compounds with cytotoxic effects.
Protocol
CPE antiviral assay: Host cells are mixed with appropriate virus stock dilutions (M.O.I. ~ 0.001) allowing for multiple rounds of infection which results in 5-10% cell viability 72 hours post infection.  A 30?l aliquot of inoculated cells (4000-6000 cells/well) is added to each well of assay plates (Corning 3712BC) pre-drugged with test compounds. Virus infected cells only are added to wells in column 22, rows B-K (no test compound) for the virus infected controls (0% CPE inhibition).  Calpain Inhibitor IV (Calbiochem #208724) at 2µg/mL final concentration is added to wells in column 22, rows L-O as a reference compound.  A 30?l aliquot of uninfected cells will be added to column 23 of each plate for the no virus cell controls (100% inhibition of CPE).  After incubating plates at 37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30?l Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes
Cytotoxicity counter screen assay: Host cells in media is added in 30?l aliquots (4000 cells/well) to each well of assay ready plates pre-drugged with test compounds as above.  Cells only (100% viability) and cells treated with hyamine at 100µM final concentration (0% viability) serve as the high and low signal controls, respectively, for cytotoxic effect in the assay.  DMSO is maintained at a constant concentration for all wells as dictated by the dilution factor of stock test compound concentrations.  After incubating plates at 37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30?l Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 
Readout
Luminescence is read using a Perkin Elmer Envision reader to measure cell viability.  For all assays the raw data from plate readers are imported into ActivityBase where values are associated with compound IDs and test concentrations. For the antiviral assays, raw signal values are converted to % inhibition by the following formula: 

% inhibition = 100 x (test cmpd value – mean value infected cell controls)/(mean value uninfected cell controls – mean value infected cell controls). 

For the cell viability assay measuring compound cytotoxicity, % cell viability is calculated as follows:
% viability = 100*(test cmpd value - mean low signal control)/(mean high signal control – mean low signal control).

EC50 and CC50 values are calculated from a four parameter logistic fit of data using the Xlfit module of ActivityBase.
Detection Method
atp levels are measured by a luminescent signal as an index of cell viability. the luminescent signal is generated in the atp dependent enzymatic conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin by firefly luciferase.

COVID-19 Nsp15 endoribonuclease FRET assay,"A fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) based biochemical assay will be utilized to measure the RNA cleavage activity of Nsp15. 
Purpose
A short, 4 nucleotide RNA substrate is commercially synthesized with a fluorophore appended to the 5â€™ end and a quencher on the opposing 3â€™ end. Close proximity of the fluorophore to the quencher will prevent detection on a fluorimeter (fluorescent resonance energy transfer, FRET). Upon enzymatic cleavage of the RNA substrate by Nsp15, the 5â€™ segment containing the fluorophore is liberated from the 3â€™ quencher, leading to increased fluorescence emission that can be detected on a fluorimeter and used as a measure of Nsp15 activity.
Protocol
In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 200 nM Nsp15 enzyme in buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, and 10 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM DTT is incubated at 25Â°C for 30 min with 1 ÂµM of RNA substrate.

COVID-19 Nsp16 2â€™-O-methyltransferase assay,"A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay (MTase-Glo, Promega) will be utilized to measure Nsp16 methyltransferase activity.
Purpose
A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay kit (MTase-Glo, Promega) was utilized to measure methyltransferase activity. The RNA substrate to be methylated in the assay was a 40 nt 5â€™ fragment of cap-0-SARS-CoV2 Wuhan isolate (m7G-CoV2). Nsp16 forms a complex with nsp10, an essential cofactor. Recombinant nsp10/nsp16 was co-purified or mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio for use in this assay. Nsp16 activity requires S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to act as the methyl donor, converting it to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) as it is consumed. At assay termination, the SAH reaction product is converted to ATP using kit provided reagents to measure luminescence via a standard luciferase reaction and correlated to nsp16 activity.
Protocol
In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 250 ng/ÂµL (7 ÂµM) nsp10/nsp16 enzyme in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 1 ÂµM SAM is incubated with 10 ng/ÂµL capped RNA substrate at 37Â°C for 2 hrs in the presence of MTase-GloTM reagent.

We have already carried out a duplicate 384-well LOPAC library screen and have excellent assay replication. We could also show that about half of the hits were not specific to COVID but also inhibited a VSV-G pseudotyped virus infection. We request to screen the ReFRAME or other libraries for inhibitory activity to COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry.

COVID-19 Papain-like protease assay,"Biochemical assay on recombinant cystine protease. Enzyme activity is determined by cleavage of a fluorogenic peptid.
Purpose
COVID-19 Papain-like protease is a cystine protease with an activity comparable to human deubiqutinase enzymes. The papain-like protease allows the virus to evade immune response by interfering with the pathways responsible for the production of interferon-gamma. Inhibitors of this protein may be useful in treating the symptoms of COVID-19 and encourage a more robust immune response.  This assay employs a fluorogenic substrate of the papain like protease, inhibitors are determined as compounds which reduce fluorescence. This assay is also a useful counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 target C3-Like protease as they are both cystine proteases but do not share any similarity are their active sites.

This readout looks at total number of HeLa-ACE2 cells 24 hours post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 as a proxy for viability. Note that only a limited and inconsistent cytopathic effect is observed in HeLa-ACE2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in this assay and this readout cannot be reliably tied to antiviral activity.
Purpose
This is a 384-well plate cell-based high-content imaging assay for identification of antiviral compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV2 3CLPRO Protease Inhibitor,"Identification of SARS-CoV2 3CLPRO protease inhibitors by luminescence assay.
Purpose
Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus. The 3CLpro is the Main protease (also known as Mpro) and is essential for replication. CoV 3CLpro has structural similarity to picornaviral 3Cpro, including those from HAV and Polio. Inhibitors of these picornavirus proteases have been pursued in the clinic. This 1536-well assay will identify inhibitors of the 3CLpro by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based cleavage reporter. The luminescence signal is dependent on cleavage by 3CLpro, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Cell viability is controlled by a constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter.
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2500 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls.

Cell Viability Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 Protease Inhibitor Assay,"Secondary assay for A00461: the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 papain-like protease assay using luminescence viability assay.
Purpose
Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the PLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the PLpro primary cell based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using doxorubicin as a known cytotoxic agent (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control).

SARS-CoV2 Entry Inhibitor,"Identification of SARS-CoV2 spike mediated inhibitors by luminescence assay.
Purpose
Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS2-CoV, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by a serine protease named TMPRSS2 demonstrated a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS2-CoV S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus.
This 1536 well assay will identify inhibitors of the S-mediated entry by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based reporter delivered by a pseudotyped viral system. The luminescence signal is dependent on entry efficiency mediated by S, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. 
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells will be seeded at 2000 cells in 2.5uL of media into each well containing compounds and controls. After 1 hour incubation the pseudo virus particles will be seeded at 2.5uL/well in complete media. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of One Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.

Cell Viability Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro Protease Inhibitor Assay,"Secondary assay for the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro protease assay using luminescence viability assay.
Purpose
Replication of coronaviruses, including the novel virus SARS-CoV2, requires the processing of two polyproteins by 2 virally encoded proteases. The chymotrypsin-like, 3CL protease cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites, while the papain-like protease (PLpro) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites and also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 form target proteins for innate immune evasion. Inhibitors that block either protease could inhibit replication of the virus, and in the case of the 3CLpro, alleviate some immune system dampening. This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the 3CLpro primary cell based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using no cells (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control). 
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2500 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.

Development of preclinical candidates for the treatment of NTM disease,"In vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify small molecule inhibitors with activity against both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species, ideally also active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Purpose
This is an in vitro high-throughput phenotypic screen to identify new orally bioavailable preclinical development candidate compounds for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease caused by both Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium species. NTM are diverse and ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly being identified globally in association with serious, usually opportunistic, infections in humans. M. abscessus, one of the most commonly identified NTM species responsible for severe respiratory, skin and mucosal infections in humans, is intrinsically resistant to available antibiotics, underscoring the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NTM lung disease.
Protocol
Mid-log (OD600 = 0.4-0.6) cultures of M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium are diluted to OD600 = 0.05 prior to incubation in the presence of the compounds at 37Â°C with shaking at 110 rpm for 3 and 4 days, respectively. Following incubation, percentage growth inhibition is calculated by normalization to Day 0 data and DMSO negative controls as reference. Compounds displaying >85% growth inhibition against both M. abscessus Bamboo and M. avium 11 species are followed up in secondary dose-response screens to identify those with the most potent activity against both organisms. Following selection of the most promising candidate compounds, carried out in consultation with Calibr, further in vitro and in vivo characterization is carried out to facilitate target deconvolution and to determine efficacy in the mouse model of NTM infection.

Secondary assay counterscreen for SARS-CoV2 spike-mediated entry Inhibitor assay using CellTiter-Glo,"Secondary assay for the identification of off target hits from the SARS-CoV2 entry assay using luminescence viability assay.
Purpose
Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS-CoV-2, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by proteases, such as a serine protease named TMPRSS2, demonstrates a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus.
This secondary assay (1536 well format) will identify off target activity of the inhibitors identified as part of the SARS-CoV-2 primary cell-based assay by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based activity. The luminescence signal is dependent on the amount of ATP available in metabolically active HEK293 cells, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate a reduction in cell viability. This assay is controlled using no cells as the (high control) vs cells treated with vehicle only (low control).
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  Cells will be transfected with protease, reporter, and control constructs prior to use and 2000 cells in 5uL of media will be plated into each well containing compounds and controls. After 48 hour incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo Firefly luciferase substrate will be added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes before luminescence reading on Perkin ViewLux.

VSV-G Counterscreen for the SARS-CoV2 Entry Inhibitor Assay,"Secondary assay using the VSV-G pseudoparticles for the Identification of off-target SARS-CoV2 spike mediated inhibitors by luminescence assay.
Purpose
Entry of coronaviruses requires the sequential functions of two subunits of spike protein (S), S1 and S2 on the viral surface. S1 subunit or more precisely a smaller domain in this region called receptor binding domain (RBD) is primarily responsible for binding to functional receptors on target cells. S2 subunit facilitates the fusion of cell membrane with viral membrane, and its efficiency is determined by priming steps by cellular proteases as well as following conformational change. SARS-CoV-2, the same as SARS-CoV, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for entry. Cleavage of S2’ site in S2 subunit by proteases, such as a serine protease named TMPRSS2, demonstrates a priming function and leads to a more efficient entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore, inhibitors that either block the interaction of S1 or RBD with cellular receptors or the fusion mediated by S2 domain could inhibit entry of the virus.
In this 1536 well assay the SARS RBD was swapped out for VSV-G which will non-specifically infect any cell. Using this approach, we will identify inhibitors of non-specific entry by monitoring the decrease in a firefly luciferase-based reporter delivered by a pseudotyped viral system. The luminescence signal is dependent on entry efficiency mediated by VSV-G, as opposed to the S protein in the primary assay, therefore a decrease in signal will indicate inhibition. Any inhibitor of the VSV-G counterscreen would thus be off target and not likely of further interest.
Protocol
Compounds and controls will be pre-spotted on to white 1536-well plates at 10mM for primary screening at 10uM final concentration.  HEK293 ACE2 expressing cells will be seeded at 2000 cells in 2.5uL of media into each well containing compounds and controls. After 1 hour incubation the pseudo virus particles will be seeded at 2.5uL/well in complete media.

ReFRAME SARS CoV-2 Cytopathic Effect Reduction Cytotoxicity Assay,"A cell viability assay was used to counter screen HTS hits from the ReFRAME to identify compounds with cytotoxic effect on VeroE6  host cells used in the HTS CPE Reduction assay.
Purpose
Compounds were screened for antiviral effect in a cell based assay measuring reduction of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the SARS CoV-2 virus infecting Vero E6 host cells.   The viability of uninfected host cells after exposure to hit compounds for 72 hours is measured in a counter screen to determine and exclude compounds with cytotoxic effects.
Protocol
Cytotoxicity counter screen assay: Assay plates (Corning 3712BC) received from Calibr are pre-drugged with test compounds and 5 ?L media is added to each well. VeroE6 cells in media is added in 25?l aliquots (4000 cells/well) to each well.  Cells added to vehicle only wells are used to measure 100% viability (high signal controls) and cells treated with hyamine at 100µM final concentration are used to measure 0% viability (low signal controls).  After incubating plates at 37°C/5%CO2 and 90% humidity for 72 hours, 30?l Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.

Identification of Inhibitors of Vaccinia Virus Infections Using High Content Image Based High Throughput Screening RAW,"Primary screen to find inhibitors against Vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. A human and a mouse cell line, treated with the compounds and infected with the VACV will be scored for percentage of infected cells by phenotypic assay
Purpose
The overarching goal is to identify compounds that inhibit smallpox infections. Since access to variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox is restricted, vaccinia virus (VACV), which is a closely related smallpox virus, is used in our infection assay. A high content image based assay is developed to score virus infections. In this assay, cells are either mock treated or treated with the compounds at 2 hours prior to incubating cells with the virus. Following infection, cells are fixed in 10% formalin and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining to detect viral antigen expressing cells. The images are then collected and analyzed to determine the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen. The assay conditions, such as the cell number, amount of virus and duration of infection are optimized such that virus undergoes multiple cycles of infection to achieve an infection rate of 70-80%. Under these conditions all types of inhibitors irrespective of the stage of the viral life cycle targeted, including entry, replication, assembly and or egress are captured. The assay also determines the compound induced cytopathic effects. Furthermore, to ensure wide coverage of host targets for the compounds, the assay is run in two different cell types, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells which are primary human fibroblasts and mouse macrophage cell line respectively.  
Protocol
MRC5 (3500 cells/well) or RAW264.7 (4000 cells/well) are seeded in Aurora ultra-low bottom 384 wells plates in 35uL volume of culture media and incubated at 37o C. The next day, cells are treated with 5uL of the test compounds (whose stock concentration is100uM) such that the final concentration of the compound is 10ÂµM in a total final volume of 50uL. Two hours later, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells are incubated with VACV at an MOI of 0.7 for 18 hours and at an MOI of 1 for 48 hours respectively in a total volume of 10uL. The final volume of culture media in each well is 50uL. Following infections, cells are fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining with 5F8 antibody to detect viral antigen expressing cells. Cells and nuclei are stained with cell mask deep red and Hoechst 33342 respectively. Plates are then imaged on Opera high content imager (Perkin Elmer, MA) with 10x objective capturing 5 fields per well. Infections rates are scored using vendor provided Acapella imaging analysis software. 
Each compound is screened in duplicates in two separate plates. Four types of controls are incorporated with in each plate. Control # 1, has 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with 0.1% vehicle control (DMSO). This control serves to set the background fluorescence intensity threshold derived from viral antigen staining. Control # 2 includes 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with a reference inhibitor. Control # 3 has 8 wells that are infected and mock treated with 0.5% DMSO. Lastly, control # 4 includes 8 wells that received both the virus and the reference inhibitor. The reference inhibitor is ST-246, which is a FDA approved drug against smallpox infection and is used at a final concertation of 10uM (AC50 is about 1uM). The four controls described provide two main checks to determine the fitness of the plate for hit analysis. Control # 3 is used to normalize the percentage infection inhibition and percentage cell numbers using Spotfire software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Control # 1 and # 3 are used to determine the statistical robustness of the assay by evaluating the Zâ€™. Plates with Zâ€™ greater than 0.5 are included for further analysis and serves as the first check point. Control # 4 serves as a second checkpoint to ensure that the reference compound shows >50% inhibition. If both conditions are satisfied then the data is analyzed for hits. Compounds that inhibit more than 50% of viral infection and shows less than 20% cytotoxicity in both replicates are considered as â€œHitsâ€ and selected for secondary dose response analysis. 
For secondary dose response analysis, an eight point dose response curve with a starting concentration of 30uM and 1/3rd serial dilution is generated. Dose Response Curves and AC50 values are generated using Genedata (Basel, Switzerland) software. 
Readout
The two main read outs are the percentage of infected cells and total number of cells in each well. These data are obtained by high content image analysis 
Average percentage of infected cells and cell number derived from eight control wells (control # 3) that were infected and mock treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control) is taken as 100% and used to normalize percentage of infection inhibition and percentage of cell numbers of each well in the plate.
Detection Method

COVID-19 Nsp14 Guanine-N7-methyltransferase counterscreen assay,"Secondary counterscreen assay for Nsp14 methyltransferase hits will utilize a commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay (MTase-Glo, Promega).
Purpose
A commercially available bioluminescence-based biochemical assay kit (MTase-Glo, Promega) was utilized to measure methyltransferase activity for the ReFRAME primary screen. Nsp14 activity requires S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to act as the methyl donor, converting it to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) as it is consumed. At assay termination, a series of kit provided coupled reactions converts SAH to light: the SAH reaction product is converted to adenosine by SAH-hydrolase; then to AMP by adenosine kinase; then to ADP by polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase; then to ATP by pyruvate kinase. Finally, luciferase converts ATP to light, which is detected on a luminometer. These subsequent coupled reactions have the potential to be inhibited and picked up as false hits in the primary screen. Therefore, a counterscreen will be performed by omitting nsp14 from the reaction mix and replacing with SAH to simulate completed methyltransferase reaction conditions, and proceeding with the coupled reactions in the presence of drugs. Any inhibition observed would be indicative of off-target activity and/or false hits. 
Protocol
In 384 plates pre-loaded with test compounds, 1 ÂµM SAH in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT is incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr in the presence of MTase-GloTM reagent.

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (main protease) inhibition high-throughput screen,"Primary high-throughput FRET-based screen for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease for the identification of therapeutics against COVID-19.
Purpose
SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 cleaves viral polyprotein to form functional viral proteins. Targeting of proteases has been effective for other viruses notably HIV and hepatitis. Thus, targeting of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is hypothesized to inhibit viral activity. This primary screen will identify new hit compounds which will be validated and screened in subsequent viral replication assays.
Protocol
Library was ordered and plated into black opaque 384-well plates (Greiner 781209) at 100nL of 10mM in DMSO. 10uL of diluted Mpro (80nM final concentration in reaction buffer: 20mM Tris pH 7.8, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100) was added with a MultiFlo FX liquid dispenser using a 5ÂµL cassette. Compounds were incubated with Mpro for 10 minutes at RT after which 10uL of substrate (8uM final concentration of either Ac-VKLQ-AFC or Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC) was dispensed into the plate and read using a Cytation 5 multi-mode reader immediately at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Ac-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-AFC and Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AFC fluorogenic substrates were monitored at 380/20 nm excitation and 500/20 nm emission wavelengths. Assay conditions were at room temperature (25Â°C) for all assays.

SARS-CoV-2 ReFrame initial screen A549-hACE2 cells ,"Secondary Assay (subset screen) Nanoluciferase reporter-based primary screen to identify compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.
Purpose
The current outbreak of COVID19 has underscored the lack of available therapeutics to treat coronavirus infections. The goal of this screen is to identify approved and investigational compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. We will use A549 cells that stably overexpress human ACE2, which serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. A549 cells are a lung epithelial carcinoma cell line which is relevant to the biology of this virus since it infects the lungs. The SARS-CoV-2 virus we will use is genetically engineered to express Nanoluciferase, which yields a quantifiable readout that is a linear correlate of viral replication.  
Protocol
A549-hACE2 cells will be seeded at 2.5 x 104 cells/well in Costar 3603 black wall clear bottom 96 well plates the day before infection. The next day, confluent monolayers will be pre-treated with drugs in 100 uL medium for 2h, infected with MOI 0.025 SARS-CoV2 NanoLuc for 45 minutes, and post-treated with fresh drug in 100uL medium in duplicate. At 48h post-infection, 50 uL NanoGlo substrate will be added to wells, plates incubated 5 minutes, and luminescence recorded using a plate reader.

Profiling a targeted set of compounds for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity,"Secondary assay of targeted compounds with potential anti SARS-CoV-2 activity
Purpose
Cell Based Screen measuring CPE.
Many methods exist for enumerating the infectivity of unmodified viruses, with the most popular being quantification of plaque forming units (PFU) and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50 assay). Both these assays rely on the ability of a virus to cause a cytopathic effect (CPE) in cultured cells. The strength of both assays is that multiple complete rounds of infection are required, and therefore inhibition at any stage of the virus lifecycle can be robustly detected. Fortunately, the CVR has SARS-CoV-2 isolates suitable for plaque and TCID50 assays.  Use of a modified version of the TCID50 assay (quantifying monolayer disruption instead of a diluted endpoint) is an established quantitative assay in use at the CVR, currently adapted for a 96-well plate format.  Fixed cell monolayers can be stained and imaged, to quantify the degree of monolayer disruption. This assay is also compatible with parallel toxicity readings as monolayer integrity, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be assessed.  Moreover, luciferase based toxicity assays can be run in the same plate.
Protocol
A549-ACE2 and A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded in optical 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer CellCarrier-96 Ultra Microplates Cat# 6055302) at 0.14x105 cells/well and incubated overnight.  The following day, the cells were incubated with a panel of 2-fold serially diluted compounds from (10-point curves in columns 1-10) where the concentrations ranged from 10 ÂµM to 20 nM. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and columns 11 and 12 were incubated with the equivalent dose of DMSO to the highest dose of DMSO used in the 10 ÂµM incubations.  The cells were then mock-infected or infected with a predetermined dose of SARS-CoV-2 that would cause substantial CPE by 72 hrs post-infection. At 72 hrs post-infection 50 ul of cell viability assay buffer is added per well. Plates are incubated at RT for 30 min and then cell viability is read in the plate by measuring luminescence. Subsequently cells (whole plates) are fixed with 8% formaldehyde and stained with Coomassie staining solution (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250/45% methanol/10% acetic acid).  The air-dried plates were scanned using a Celigo imaging cytometer (Nexcelom), allowing monolayer integrity to be quantified.  Subsequent steps determined by the B&MGF.

MDDC- Vaccine Adjuvant ReFRAME Screen,"Primary screen will be performed in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) to identify agonists of innate immune signaling pathway using a screening platform developed and published by the Chanda lab (Yoh et al, 2015).  Hit compounds will be tested for efficacy as adjuvant(s) for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to help in immediate clinical testing and application in patients.
Purpose
The assay utilizes an IRF3-dependent gene, ISG54 as a proximal readout of activation of innate immune
Protocol
The protocol involves procurement of blood from donor(s). PBMCs are isolated from each donor and MDDC differentiation initiated using IL4 and GM-CSF. Following 7 days of differentiation, the cells are counted and seeded onto pre-spotted onto compound treated plates â€“ typically MDDCs from 3 donors are pooled to minimize donor-dependent variability in the readout. Following 6-8h treatment with the compounds, the cell culture media is removed, and cells are frozen until further processing. For detection of ISG54 mRNA, the plates are thawed to room-temperature, lysis buffer added to ensure release of cytosolic contents, the lysate is acoustically transferred onto 384w qPCR plates, and one-step RNA-cDNA qPCR (Taqman chemistry) performed. Ct values are used to calculate fold-change over negative control (DMSO), a tool compound is used to identify Zâ€™ of each plate, and plate medians used to calculate Z-scores for test compounds. Compounds with Z-scores of ~2.0 or higher are considered hits.

XDR Acinetobacter baumannii in absence of amikacin potentiation,"Secondary assay to A00386. Identification of potentiators of amikacin against XDR Acinetobacter baumannii via growth inhibition assay
Purpose
The goal of this screen is to identify compounds in the ReFRAME library that potentiate the efficacy of the aminoglycoside amikacin against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii. Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are important therapeutic options for treating nosocomial Gram-negative infections, but resistant isolates are increasingly reported. Mechanistically, aminoglycosides have the dual advantage of inhibiting protein synthesis, thereby decreasing the expression of bacterial toxins and resistance-mediating enzymes, and permeabilizing the outer membrane. The 384-well screen identifies inhibitors of globally prevalent XDR A. baumannii strains, either through potentiation of amikacin and/or direct growth inhibition. This screen is performed following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines, which recommends using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) reference methods for drug susceptibility testing (ISO 20776-1:2019). These guidelines were adapted to 384-well format to accommodate high-throughput screening and primary screening at single concentration.
Protocol
Compounds will be pre-spotted onto 384 well microtiter plate (columns 3-22) at 20 ÂµM for primary screen and 40 ÂµM top concentration for dose response together with a fixed subinhibitory concentration of amikacin corresponding to approximately 1/3 x MIC50 against the XDR A. baumannii strains. 5 x 105 CFU/mL of bacteria in Cation-Adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (CAMHB) are then dispensed to wells in columns 1-24 to a final volume of 50 Î¼l per well. Control conditions are bacteria only with DMSO (negative control), bacteria plus amikacin at the selected combination screen concentration (to be determined) and bacteria plus positive drug control apramycin (at 4x MIC). Plate are incubated for 20h at 37Â°C and optical density at 600 nm (OD600) read with a multimode plate reader.

Identification of Inhibitors of Vaccinia Virus Infections Using High Content Image Based High Throughput Screening MRC5,"Secondary assay for A00516. Primary screen to find inhibitors against Vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. A human and a mouse cell line, treated with the compounds and infected with the VACV will be scored for percentage of infected cells by phenotypic assay
Purpose
The overarching goal is to identify compounds that inhibit smallpox infections. Since access to variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox is restricted, vaccinia virus (VACV), which is a closely related smallpox virus, is used in our infection assay. A high content image based assay is developed to score virus infections. In this assay, cells are either mock treated or treated with the compounds at 2 hours prior to incubating cells with the virus. Following infection, cells are fixed in 10% formalin and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining to detect viral antigen expressing cells. The images are then collected and analyzed to determine the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen. The assay conditions, such as the cell number, amount of virus and duration of infection are optimized such that virus undergoes multiple cycles of infection to achieve an infection rate of 70-80%. Under these conditions all types of inhibitors irrespective of the stage of the viral life cycle targeted, including entry, replication, assembly and or egress are captured. The assay also determines the compound induced cytopathic effects. Furthermore, to ensure wide coverage of host targets for the compounds, the assay is run in two different cell types, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells which are primary human fibroblasts and mouse macrophage cell line respectively.  
Protocol
MRC5 (3500 cells/well) or RAW264.7 (4000 cells/well) are seeded in Aurora ultra-low bottom 384 wells plates in 35uL volume of culture media and incubated at 37o C. The next day, cells are treated with 5uL of the test compounds (whose stock concentration is100uM) such that the final concentration of the compound is 10ÂµM in a total final volume of 50uL. Two hours later, MRC5 and RAW264.7 cells are incubated with VACV at an MOI of 0.7 for 18 hours and at an MOI of 1 for 48 hours respectively in a total volume of 10uL. The final volume of culture media in each well is 50uL. Following infections, cells are fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining with 5F8 antibody to detect viral antigen expressing cells. Cells and nuclei are stained with cell mask deep red and Hoechst 33342 respectively. Plates are then imaged on Opera high content imager (Perkin Elmer, MA) with 10x objective capturing 5 fields per well. Infections rates are scored using vendor provided Acapella imaging analysis software. 
Each compound is screened in duplicates in two separate plates. Four types of controls are incorporated with in each plate. Control # 1, has 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with 0.1% vehicle control (DMSO). This control serves to set the background fluorescence intensity threshold derived from viral antigen staining. Control # 2 includes 8 wells that are mock infected and treated with a reference inhibitor. Control # 3 has 8 wells that are infected and mock treated with 0.5% DMSO. Lastly, control # 4 includes 8 wells that received both the virus and the reference inhibitor. The reference inhibitor is ST-246, which is a FDA approved drug against smallpox infection and is used at a final concertation of 10uM (AC50 is about 1uM). The four controls described provide two main checks to determine the fitness of the plate for hit analysis. Control # 3 is used to normalize the percentage infection inhibition and percentage cell numbers using Spotfire software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Control # 1 and # 3 are used to determine the statistical robustness of the assay by evaluating the Zâ€™. Plates with Zâ€™ greater than 0.5 are included for further analysis and serves as the first check point. Control # 4 serves as a second checkpoint to ensure that the reference compound shows >50% inhibition. If both conditions are satisfied then the data is analyzed for hits. Compounds that inhibit more than 50% of viral infection and shows less than 20% cytotoxicity in both replicates are considered as â€œHitsâ€ and selected for secondary dose response analysis. 
For secondary dose response analysis, an eight point dose response curve with a starting concentration of 30uM and 1/3rd serial dilution is generated. Dose Response Curves and AC50 values are generated using Genedata (Basel, Switzerland) software.

Translational Readthrough of a CFTR Nonsense Mutation R1162X,"Primary (HTS) assay identifies molecules promoting readthrough of mRNA coding for a CFTR-NanoLuc fusion protein containing a premature truncation codon (PTC) expressed from the native CFTR gene locus. Luminescence indicates successful readthrough of the PTC in the CFTR gene sequence, upstream of the C-terminal NanoLuc luciferase.
Purpose
The development of effective CF therapies that target CFTR nonsense mutations (in-frame premature termination codons, PTCs) encoding truncated, nonfunctional protein remains an unmet need. Using gene-editing technologies, we introduced the naturally occurring R1162X PTC mutation and the NanoLuc reporter into the native CFTR gene in the human airway-derived 16HBE14o- cell line.  The reporter gene is downstream of the CFTR R1162X mutation. Readthrough of CFTR R1162X then results in a luminescence signal that correlates with the efficiency of translational readthrough or the final concentration of full-length CFTR with C-terminal fused NanoLuc enzyme.
Our assay is an improvement over previous (cDNA-based) HTS assays, because it encompasses the full native CFTR gene and all relevant biology (CFTR pre-mRNA splicing, Nonsense Mediated Decay) in a screening assay.
Protocol
16HBEge cells expressing the CFTR R1162X-NanoLuc fusion protein will be seeded into 384-well pre-spotted assay ready plates. 1 Î¼M of CC-90009 (an eRF3a degrader) will be added to the culture medium of all the samples at the same time to sensitize the assay.  The assay plates will be incubated at 37oC and 5% CO2 for 48 hours. 
Post 48 hours of compound treatment, the cells will be assayed for NanoLuc activity using NanoGloÂ® Live Cell Assay from Promega (Catalog # N2011). Growth medium from assay plates will be replaced with buffered cell culture medium (Opti-MEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific # 11058021; 16 Î¼L /well). 4 Î¼L Nano-Glo Live Cell Reagent will be added to each well.

Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-protein Rab-7 from Multiplex,"A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding.
Purpose
Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful.
This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.  

Data listed in this assay shows specifically Kras-WT from the multiplex. Please view the following assays for the other g-binding proteins: Kras-WT (A00647), Kras-G13D (A00645), Kras-G12V (A00646), Kras-G12D (A00643), Kras-Q61H (A00641), Rac-1 WT (A00640), CDC-42 WT (A00642), and Rho-A (A00644)
Protocol
Bead sets (4ÂµM) that have been pre-coupled with GST~GTPase constructs overnight are washed to remove unbound proteins and are kept on ice until use. Assay plates with pre-spotted compounds (10ÂµM for the primary screen, 100ÂµM top concentration for the concentration-dependent analyses) and DMSO controls are assembled by adding 5ÂµL of assay buffer followed by 5ÂµL of the coupled bead set mixtures. The final concentration of each bead set is 200 beads/ÂµL. Compounds are incubated with GTPase~coupled beads for 30 minutes followed by the addition 100 nL of Bodipy-GTP to a final concentration of 10 nL followed by incubation for 1 hour.

Inhibition of Bodipy-GTP binding to small g-protein CDC-42 in Multiplex,"A microsphere-based screen that simultaneously interrogates GTP binding to a set of small G-proteins. Eight GST~G-proteins are coupled to bead sets of varying fluorescence intensity. Flow Cytometry is used to discriminate individual bead bound G-proteins and evaluate Bodipy-GTP binding.
Purpose
Small GTPases that include the Ras and Rho families regulate a wide range of cell signaling pathways by alternating between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states. In normal physiological conditions, their activities are tightly controlled and aberrant behavior related to an increased presence of GTP-bound forms contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. For this reason, the identification of small, cell-permeable molecules capable of modulating GTP-binding in a specific and reversible manner could prove therapeutically useful.
This 384-well flow cytometric assay is capable of measuring Bodipy-GTP binding to nine small G-proteins simultaneously  (KRas WT, G13D, G12V, G12D, Q61H; Rac1 WT, CDC42 WT; Rab7 WT; RhoA). Chimeric GST~fusion proteins are bound to glutathione bead sets that are discriminated by differing intensities of red fluorescence of a fixed wavelength. Bodipy-GTP binding is detected using a separate green-wavelength channel. This format allows for the potential identification of selective modulators of GTP binding to particular G-proteins. Both increased and decreased fluorescence of bound Bodipy-GTP can be quantified.  

Data listed in this assay shows specifically Kras-WT from the multiplex. Please view the following assays for the other g-binding proteins: Kras-WT (A00647), Kras-G13D (A00645), Kras-G12V (A00646), Kras-G12D (A00643), Kras-Q61H (A00641); Rac-1 WT (A00640), Rab-7 WT (A00639), and Rho-A (A00644)

M.bovis_bovine TB,"A laboratory strain of M. bovis, the main cause of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, and a neglected cause of TB in humans will be studied and bacterial viability will be assessed by GFP fluorescence.
Purpose
A laboratory strain of M. bovis, the main cause of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, and a neglected cause of TB in humans will be dispensed directly into the assay-ready dry spotted 384 well plates provided by ReFRAME. Preliminary studies will be performed to determine the optimal optical density (and equivalent CFU) of M. bovis to use in the 384 well format using recognized antibacterial compounds as positive controls. Plates will be incubated at 37 oC for an ideal duration of approx.. 48 hrs, to minimise risk of evaporation from wells; however, data will be recorded daily. A reporter strain utilizing pTiGc is currently being constructed by our lab. This dual-reporter strain will enable observation of bacterial viability by constitutive GFP fluorescence, and replication state by inducible TurboFP635 fluorescence.
Protocol
A laboratory strain of M.bovis (AF2122/97) modified to express the pTiGc (KanR) will be cultured in liquid broth media (Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing 75 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05% Tween80 and 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC).) at 37oC with shaking to an approx. OD600 of 1 (this will be determined in preliminary assays with control compounds). This culture will be automatically dispensed by BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega equipment directly into each well of the pre-spotted 384 well plates provided by ReFRAME at a total volume of 50 uL per well. The plates will then be sealed and incubated at 37 oC, static culture, for 48 hrs (the input OD will be optimized to enable distinction of either growth or killing over this period using positive control compounds). Measurement of bacterial viability will be assessed by GFP fluorescence daily up to ten days. To assess the replicative state of the bacteria, they will be pre-treated with theophylline substrate solution for 24hrs to induce expression of the TurboFP635 reporter, followed by washing and seeding into the 384 well plates. Preliminary studies with control compounds will determine the equivalent CFU that corresponds to the fluorescence values recorded in this assay. Data will be recorded and converted into Excel spreadsheet format.

Snake Venom Metalloproteinase Assay,"Not Available
Purpose
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are Zn2+ dependent enzymes that form the major toxin family in Viperid snake venoms (11-65% of total venom). They typically target proteins within the basement membrane of the vasculature (although they are not exclusively limited to these) and are responsible for both localized and systemic toxicity, typically manifesting as hemorrhage which can prove fatal if uncontrolled. Inhibition of these toxins has already shown protective effects at in vivo level, and in vitro screening is key for identifying potential therapeutics. SVMP activity can be quantified by measuring the quenching of the matrix metalloproteinase substrate ES010. The measured fluorescence is directly proportional to SVMP activity in the sample and can therefore be used to identify inhibitory molecules with potential therapeutic applicability. The benefit of this assay is that it is highly amenable to high-through screening, and provides high quality data that translates into demonstrable preclinical applicability. 
Protocol
Pre-spotted plates containing 0.455 ÂµL of drug and controls are removed from the freezer to thaw for 10 minutes prior to the commencement of assay. The appropriate snake venom is thawed, diluted into PBS, and added at 1 Âµg/reaction (15 Âµl). Immediately after the addition of the venom, the plate is sealed and covered in foil, and incubated at 37Â°C for 25 minutes. While the incubation is ongoing, thawed ES010 substrate is diluted to the working concentration of 9.1 ÂµM and the bottle wrapped in foil to protect from light. After 25 minutes, the plate is removed from the incubator and allowed to cool on the benchtop for 5 minutes, still covered. Then, 75 Âµl of 9.1 ÂµM substrate solution is added to each well, bringing the final substrate concentration to 7.5 ÂµM and the final well volume to 91 ÂµL. The plate is re-sealed and covered, then placed in the incubator at 25Â°C for 30 minutes to allow the reaction to reach the end point. After incubation, the fluorescence intensity is read at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320/405 nm at 25Â°C.

Snake Venom Phospholipase A2 Assay,"Not Available
Purpose
Screen to identify drugs that inhibit the snake venom phospholipases found in diverse snake venoms. 384 well plate endpoint-based absorbance enzyme assay.

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are enzymes found in both viper and cobra venoms which lead to neurotoxicity, anticoagulant effects and myotoxicity. They are calcium-dependent proteins similar to secretory PLA2s in humans. Varespladib, a drug developed to treat coronary artery disease was repurposed for treating snakebite with great success and was effective against a variety of neurotoxic and haemorrhagic venoms. We aim to identify novel inhibitors by in vitro screening of drug libraries using an absorbance-based assay that has been adapted for high-throughput.  




Protocol
The method is adapted for high-throughput based on the Abcam kit ab133089 for measuring sPLA2 activity. Pre-spotted plates containing 0.45 ÂµL of drug and controls are removed from the freezer to thaw for 10 minutes prior to the commencement of assay. The appropriate snake venom is thawed, diluted into PBS, and added at an appropriate concentration determined based on the linearity of the assay for the respective venom (10 Âµl). Immediately after the addition of the venom, the plate is sealed and covered in foil, and incubated at 37 Â°C for 25 minutes. While the incubation is ongoing, DTNB is made at a stock concentration of 4 mM and the substrate diluted in assay buffer at a stock concentration of 1.4 mM. After 25 minutes, the plate is removed from the incubator and allowed to cool on the benchtop for 5 minutes, still covered. Then, 5 Âµl of DTNB and 30 ÂµL of substrate solution are added to each well, bringing the final substrate concentration to 0.88 mM and the final well volume to 45 ÂµL. The plate is then immediately read at 405 nm for 15 min at 25Â°C in a kinetic assay, and the slopes of the curves used to calculate activity.

Secondary assay to A00668.
Readout
The absorbance readings at 405 nm are directly proportional to venom activity. DMSO-only wells are used as the negative control (drugs are dissolved in DMSO). Varespladib, a well-known PLA2 inhibitor is used as the positive control, as a concentration of 10 ÂµM is sufficient to bring absorbance to baseline levels in the presence of venom. Inhibition is reported as a function of varespladib, with the positive control expressed as 100% inhibition.
