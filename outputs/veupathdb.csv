"Origin of a High-Latitude Population of Aedes aegypti in Washington, DC","An overwintering population of Aedes aegypti has been documented in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of
 Washington, DC, since 2011. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequence data presented in a previous
 study traced the origin to the New World. Here, we use microsatellite and SNP chip data along with more
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences on Washington Ae. aegypti samples and samples from potential sources to
 further narrow the origin of this population. Genetically, Washington Ae. aegypti are closest to populations in
Florida, meaning this is the most likely source. Florida experienced the first mosquito-borne transmission of dengue
in the United States after decades of absence of this disease, as well as local transmission of chikungunya and Zika
in recent years. This indicates that the Capitol Hill, Washington, DC population of Ae. aegypti is capable of
 transmitting viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in modern US city environments.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genetics	Population genetics	Infectious disease

Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

Gene trapping (aligned to Indian strain)),"A piggyBac transposon-based gene trap element was transformed into Anopheles stephensi, and remobilized using the jumpstarter approach using genetic crosses. Individuals that displayed a gene trap remobilization event were then photodocumented and their RNA and DNA complements were extracted. The DNA compelement was used to determine the genomic insertion site, while the RNA was used to determine the transcript coverage of the genes into which the transposons inserted. In nearly half of the cases, insertion was identified to fall within introns present in the 5''-UTR of transcripts- which are not indicated in the current ab initio models for Anopheles stephensi. The ability to utilize next generation RNA-Seq elucidated the functionality of the gene trap elements that inserted outside of the ab initio gene models, providing clear evidence that not only was the gene trap element working properly, but that it also had a bias towards 5''-end insertion, in particular, 5''-UTR intronic insertion.

Traps were set from dusk until dawn one day a week. Culicoides were categorised into groups using wing patterns and metrics. Male members of the subgenus Avaritia were identified to species level based on their genital morphology, whilst females were treated as a single group and sub-divided according to the appearance of their abdomen (unpigmented, pigmented, gravid and blood-fed). Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles albimanus),"Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genomics	Annotation	Microbiology

A machine-learning approach to map landscape connectivity in Aedes aegypti with genetic and environmental data,"Mapping landscape connectivity is important for controlling invasive species and disease vectors. Current landscape genetics methods are often constrained by the subjectivity of creating resistance surfaces and the difficulty of working with interacting and correlated environmental variables. To overcome these constraints, the advantages of a machine learning framework combined with an iterative optimization process to develop a method for integrating genetic and environmental data. Here, this method is validated and demonstrated for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, an invasive species and the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika.  A map of genetic connectivity is produced for Ae. aegypti's range in North America and discuss which environmental and anthropogenic variables are most important for predicting gene flow, especially in the context of vector control.

The male determining M-factor of the global disease vector Musca domestica is a paralog of the generic splice factor CWC22,"Sex determination mechanisms are bewilderingly diverse. A cascade of genes with hierarchical regulation characterizes sex determination pathways in insects.  How such pathways evolve is poorly understood, partly due to a lack of comparative data. Houseflies are well known for their polymorphic sex determination with populations carrying a dominant male determiner M on the Y chromosome or any of the five autosomes. We identified the male determining gene Mdm responsible for splicing regulation of the key switch transformer by exploiting the existence of housefly populations with different sex determination mechanisms. We demonstrate that Mdm originated from duplication of CWC22/nucampholin, a generic and essential splicing regulator across Metazoans with a crucial role in exon-junction complex assembly and non-sense mediated decay. We show that strains with the M-locus on the Y and on different autosomes carry multiple copies of Mdm indicating that the same male determiner translocated to different genomic sites in the genome. We found that embryonic RNAi-based silencing of Mdm leads to differentiation of ovaries in males, while targeted Mdm disruption with CRISPR/CAS-9 resulted in complete sex reversal to fertile females. Our study reveals how a duplicate of a gene with a general splice-regulation role during development can be recruited to serve a specific function in the determination of male sex. Mdm appears to be unique to the housefly representing a compelling example for the plasticity at the instructive level of sex determination hierarchies.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Infectious disease	Urology and nephrology	Zoology

Malaria vectors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: the mechanisms that confer insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized as a holoendemic malaria area with the main vectors being Anopheles funestus and members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Due to political instability and socio-economic challenges in the region, knowledge of insecticide resistance status and resistance mechanisms in these vectors is limited. Mosquitoes were collected from a mining site in the north-eastern part of the country and, following identification, were subjected to extensive testing for the target-site and biochemical basis of resistance. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess a suite of 10 genes frequently involved in pyrethroid and DDT resistance in An. gambiae females and males. In An. funestus, gene expression microarray analysis was carried out on female mosquitoes. (MapVEu VBP0000203)",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genomics	Sequence analysis	Biology

Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles arabiensis),"Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads.

"Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles stephensi, aligned to SDA-500)","Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Animal study  	Biology  	Immunology

Insecticide resistance patterns in Uganda and the effect of indoor residual spraying with bendiocarb on kdr L1014S frequencies in Anopheles gambiae s.s.,Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from multiple sites in nine districts of Uganda (up to five sites per district). Three districts had been sprayed with bendiocarb. Phenotypic resistance was determined using standard susceptibility tests. Molecular assays were used to determine the frequency of resistance mutations. The kdr L1014S homozygote frequency in Anopheles gambiae s.s. was used as the outcome measure to test the effects of various factors using a logistic regression model.

Evidence of a multiple insecticide resistance in the malaria vector Anopheles funestus in South West Nigeria,"Plasmodium infection analysis using TaqMan protocol coupled with a nested PCR revealed an infection rate of 8% in An. funestus s.s. from Akaka-Remo. WHO susceptibility tests showed this species has developed multiple resistance to insecticides in the study area. Anopheles funestus s.s. population in Akaka-Remo is highly resistant to organochlorines: dieldrin (8%) and DDT (10%). Resistance was also observed against pyrethroids: permethrin (68%) and deltamethrin (87%), and the carbamate bendiocarb (84%). Mortality rate with DDT slightly increased (from 10 to 30%, n = 45) after PBO pre-exposure indicating that cytochrome P450s play little role in DDT resistance while high mortalities were recorded after PBO pre-exposure with permethrin (from 68 to 100%, n = 70) and dieldrin (from 8 to 100%, n = 48) suggesting the implication of P450s in the observed permethrin and dieldrin resistance. High frequencies of resistant allele, 119F in F0 (77%) and F1 (80% in resistant and 72% in susceptible) populations with an odd ratio of 1.56 (P = 0.1859) show that L119F-GSTe2 mutation is almost fixed in the population. Genotyping of the A296S-RDL mutation in both F0 and F1 samples shows an association with dieldrin resistance with an odd ratio of 81 (P < 0.0001) (allelic frequency (R) = 76% for F0; for F1, 90 and 10% were observed in resistant and susceptible populations, respectively) as this mutation is not yet fixed in the population.

Response of mosquito larvae to changes in hypoxia signaling,"Mosquito larvae require a reduction in gut oxygen levels (induced hypoxia) to successfully molt between instars. In natural environments, this hypoxia is generated by the consumption of oxygen by aerobically respiring microbes in the gut. This signal activates the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway leading to expression of response genes. To identify the genes that are induced or repressed by hypoxia, we indirectly activated or suppressed hypoxia by rearing mosquitoes with aerobic, wild-type E. coli (K12) or with E. coli encoding a defective cytochrome oxidase. We directly manipulated HIF signaling using pharmacological agents that activated or suppressed HIF signaling. This work will identify genes that are essential for responding to hypoxia and necessary for successful molting in mosquitoes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Developmental biology     Embryology     Gene expression

The effect of permethrin resistance on transcriptome following ingestion of Zika virus infected blood,"Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector of many emerging arboviruses. Insecticide resistance among mosquito populations is a consequence of the application of insecticides for mosquito control. We used RNA-Seq to compare transcriptomes between permethrin resistant and susceptible strains of Florida Ae. aegypti in response to Zika virus infection.  Overall design: Ae. aegypti larvae were collected from Key West (24.55 N, 81.78 W), Florida, USA and maintained at the Florida Medical Entomological Laboratory (FMEL) in Vero Beach, FL since 2011. The parental collection of Ae. aegypti from the field was initially tested for permethrin resistance, then subjected to permethrin selection for 15 generations (see below) and again assayed for resistance (referred to as the resistant strain). The Orlando strain of Ae. aegypti was collected from Orlando (28.53 N, 81.37 W), Florida, USA and reared in the Mosquito and Fly Research Unit, Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, ARS-USDA in Gainesville, FL since 1952. The Orlando strain is recognized as a permethrin susceptible strain of Ae. aegypti. Four-day-old female adults were fed defibrinated bovine blood containing either ZIKV (treatment) or blood lacking virus (control). The ZIKV infected and control mosquitoes from two Ae. aegypti strains were harvested for a time course study. Individual mosquitoes were dissected into body and legs and tested to confirm susceptibility to infection and disseminated infection rates, respectively. Ten mosquitoes (12 hours and 7 days post ZIKV infection) were pooled for each sample for RNA-Seq.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Infectious disease	Medical informatics	Public health and epidemiology

Traps were set from dusk until dawn one day a week. Culicoides were categorised into groups using wing patterns and metrics. Male members of the subgenus Avaritia were identified to species level based on their genital morphology, whilst females were treated as a single group and sub-divided according to the appearance of their abdomen (unpigmented, pigmented, gravid and blood-fed). Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

Samples of A. aegypti eggs were obtained at two different time periods (2012 and 2014), using ovitraps in different locations in Santiago Island to establish the parental population. F1 larvae were exposed to different concentrations of insecticides (Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti), diflubenzuron and temephos) to estimate the lethal concentrations (LC90) and calculate the respective rate of resistance (RR90). Semi-field tests using temephos-ABATE® were performed to evaluate the persistence of the product. Bottle tests using female mosquitoes were carried out to determine the susceptibility to the adulticides malathion, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Biochemical and molecular tests were performed to investigate the presence of metabolic resistance mechanisms, associated with the enzymes glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), esterases and mixed-function oxidases (MFO) and to detect mutations or alterations in the sodium channel and acetylcholinesterase genes.

The sampling protocol scaled the number of larvae taken to habitat size to reduce the possibility of sampling siblings. Indoor-resting adult females were collected by aspiration or by trapping in untreated bednets. All samples were confirmed morphologically as A. gambiae sensu lato. A PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) molecular diagnostic of X chromosome rDNA variation was used to determine species identity within the A. gambiae sensu lato group and A. gambiae sensu stricto molecular form (M or S).  1,826 individuals were genotyped at 1,536 loci using a microarray.  1,517 individuals from Cameroon and Ghana were also assayed for survival upon exposure to LT50 0.75% permethrin.

Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles farauti),"Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Environmental sciences   Ecology   Infectious disease

An. gambiae long RNA paired end sequencing 48h post P. berghei infection after J2 antibody pull down,"The Anopheles gambiae s.s.

The strain was reared in the insectary of the Pasteur Institute CEnter for Production and Infections of Anopheles (Platform CEPIA, Institut Pasteur, France) under standard rearing conditions at 26 C and 80% relative humidity, under a 12 h light/dark cycle as previously described (Harris et al., 2010). Mosquitoes were fed on mice infected with a clone of P. berghei strain pbANKA, expressing GFP under the hsp70 promoter at 5-10% parasitemia with mature gametocytes, gametocyte maturity was tested by exflagellation of microgametes. Mosquitoes were maintained at 21 C and 80% relative humidity on 10% sucrose. Pools of 30 An. gambiae Ngousso mosquito midguts 48h after P. berghei infected or control feeding were homogenized in TRIzol (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted by following standard manufacturer instructions.
Immunoprecipitation was performed on the extracted RNA using protein G agarose (Invitrogen) and anti-dsRNA antibody J2 (scicons). 3 conditions were performed: RNA from infected midguts and the J2 antibody; RNA from infected midguts and a  mouse IgG2a isotype control; RNA from uninfected midguts and the J2 antibody. Biological duplicates were performed. Bound RNA on the beads was extracted using TRIzol (Ambion).
Paired end librairies then were prepared using Paired end RNA Library reagents (Illumina).
Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 in a HiSeq Rapid Run workflow (Illumina). Primary analysis of the sequences was performed with Casava software (v1.8 Illumina).

Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles dirus),"Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Biology	Molecular biology	Genetics

Male members of the subgenus Avaritia were identified to species level based on their genital morphology, whilst females were treated as a single group and sub-divided according to the appearance of their abdomen (unpigmented, pigmented, gravid and blood-fed). Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

The past few years have witnessed the emergence of approaches based on knockdown of genes involved in milk production, resulting in a significant reduction of fecundity.In order to identify further genes applicable in the control of tsetse flies, we determined the expression of protein-coding genes in ovaries and uteri from both virgin and heavily pregnant Glossina morsitans morsitans females. Comparison of expression profiles allowed us to identify candidate genes with increased expression in pregnant individuals.

Transcriptomic analysis of the piRNA pathway in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus,"The piRNA pathway provides a defense system that protects the genome of metazoans from the deleterious effects caused by transposable elements mobilization. Core components of the pathway are the Piwi clade Argonaute proteins and the associated small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs. In this study, we set to investigate the evolutionary conservation of the piRNA pathway in Rhodnius prolixus, a primary insect vector of the Chagas disease. First, we identified the Rhodnius orthologs of the proteins that act in the biogenesis and function of the piRNAs in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ovary. Then, we employed transcriptomic analyses using total RNA extracted from previtellogenic stages of of Rhodnius' oogenesis to determine their expression levels. Our study reveals that important enzymatic activities, including the three piwi orthologs (i.e. Rp-piwi2, Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3) and a vasa gene are expressed at substantial levels in Rhodnius ovaries. We also show the a fourth piwi ortholog, namely Rp-piwi1, is not expressed in early oogenesis and might be dispensable for Rhodnius adult female fertility. Finally, we unveil interesting differences between Drosophila and Rhodnius. For instance, the spnE gene, which is crucial for piRNA biogenesis in the fruit fly, is expressed at negligible levels in Rhodnius, where it might not be required for piRNA production. Our transcriptomic analyses also provide a full catalog of the genes expressed in Rhodnius ovaries and reveal that the current annotations of the Rhodnius genome do not fully reflect the actual structure and length of the transcripts expressed in this species. Thus, our study provides new insight in the evolution of the piRNA pathway and a valuable resource for future genomic and functional studies.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genomics 	Biology	Genetics

Gene trapping (aligned to SDA-500 strain),"A piggyBac transposon-based gene trap element was transformed into Anopheles stephensi , and remobilized using the jumpstarter approach using genetic crosses. Individuals that displayed a gene trap remobilization event were then photodocumented and their RNA and DNA complements were extracted. The DNA compelement was used to determine the genomic insertion site, while the RNA was used to determine the transcript coverage of the genes into which the transposons inserted. In nearly half of the cases, insertion was identified to fall within introns present in the 5''-UTR of transcripts- which are not indicated in the current ab initio models for Anopheles stephensi. The ability to utilize next generation RNA-Seq elucidated the functionality of the gene trap elements that inserted outside of the ab initio gene models, providing clear evidence that not only was the gene trap element working properly, but that it also had a bias towards 5''-end insertion, in particular, 5''-UTR intronic insertion.

Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

"Origin of a High-Latitude Population of Aedes aegypti in Washington, DC","An overwintering population of Aedes aegypti has been documented in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of
 Washington, DC, since 2011. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequence data presented in a previous
 study traced the origin to the New World. Here, we use microsatellite and SNP chip data along with more
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences on Washington Ae. aegypti samples and samples from potential sources to
 further narrow the origin of this population. Genetically, Washington Ae. aegypti are closest to populations in
Florida, meaning this is the most likely source. Florida experienced the first mosquito-borne transmission of dengue
in the United States after decades of absence of this disease, as well as local transmission of chikungunya and Zika
in recent years. This indicates that the Capitol Hill, Washington, DC population of Ae. aegypti is capable of
 transmitting viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in modern US city environments. (MapVEu VBP0000201)",gpt-3.5-turbo,Environmental sciences    Ecology    Zoology

Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles quadriannulatus),"Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,Parasitology	Population genetics	Ecology

Intensive trapping of blood-fed Anopheles darlingi in Amazonian Peru reveals unexpectedly high proportions of avian blood-meals,"Anopheles darlingi, the main malaria vector in the Neotropics, has been considered to be highly anthropophilic. However, many behavioral aspects of this species remain unknown, such as the range of blood-meal sources. Barrier screens were used to collect resting Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes from 2013 to 2015 in three riverine localities (Lupuna, Cahuide and Santa Emilia) in Amazonian Peru.  Mosquito age, estimated in two localities, Lupuna and Cahuide, ranged widely between sites and years. This variation may reflect the range of local environmental factors that influence longevity or possibly potential changes in the ability of the mosquito to transmit the parasite. Of 6,204 resting An. darlingi tested for Plasmodium infection, 0.42% were infected with P. vivax. This study provides evidence for the first time of the usefulness of barrier screens for the collection of blood-fed resting mosquitoes to calculate the Human Blood Index (HBI) and other blood-meal sources in a neotropical malaria endemic setting.

Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of Anopheles gambiae (Ag55) cells: a potential model to study mosquito-pathogen interaction,"The goal of this study is to analyze the gene expression profile of Anopheles gambiae Ag55 cells and compare it with gene expression profile of blood fed female Anopheles gambiae adult to establish Ag55 cells as a potential model to study mosquito-pathogen interactions Methods: The transcript profiles of Ag55 cells were generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000 v3 platform. The 7 samples (paired-end reads, including replicates ( 3 samples from Ag55 cells and 4 samples from blood-fed female adults downloaded from NCBI GEO (Series GSE55453, SRA id : SRP039058))) were independently mapped on to A. gambiae genome (Anopheles-gambiae-PEST_CHROMOSOMES_AgamP4.fa.gz) downloaded from vectorbase by using TopHat followed by Cufflinks to estimate the expression values of the transcripts in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) with the cuffdiff2 default geometric normalization. Differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing) were identified for Ag55 cells relative to Blood fed female adults Results: We provide detailed gene expression and proteome profiles of Ag55 cells. We further compare the gene expression profiles of Ag55 cells and blood fed female adults. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of our transcriptomic data suggested that Ag55 cells have phagocytic properties, a hypothesis which we confirmed using confocal imaging. Transcriptomic data further backed by proteomic data suggest that Ag55 cells express hemocyte like properties, and are immune competent. Conclusion: As Ag55 cells are immune competent and express hemocyte like properties they can be used as a model to study vector-pathogen immune response. Furthermore, the availability of transcriptomic and proteomic data of Ag55 cells will help researchers use and engineer the Ag55 cell line in an efficient way, for example by developing strategies to make it more suitable for studies of interactions with Plasmodium and other microbes.

Unraveling the Plasmodium vivax sporozoite transcriptional journey from mosquito vector to human host,"Malaria parasites transmitted by mosquito bite are remarkably efficient in establishing human infections. The infection process requires ~30 minutes and is highly complex as quiescent sporozoites injected with mosquito saliva must be rapidly activated in the skin, migrate through the body, and infect the liver. This process is poorly understood for Plasmodium vivax due to low infectivity in the in vitro models. To study this skin-to-liver stage of malaria, we developed quantitative bioassays coupled with transcriptomics to evaluate parasite changes linked with mammalian microenvironmental factors. Our in vitro phenotype and RNA-Seq analyses revealed key microenvironmental relationships with distinct biological functions. M ost notable, preservation of sporozoite quiescence by exposure to insect-like factors coupled with strategic activation limits untimely activation of invasion-associated genes to dramatically increase hepatocyte invasion rates. We also report the first transcriptomic analysis of the P. vivax sporozoite interaction in salivary glands identifying 118 infection-related differentially-regulated Anopheles dirus genes. These results provide important new insights in malaria parasite biology and identify priority targets for antimalarial therapeutic interventions to block P. vivax infection.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genomics	Sequence analysis	Data submission, annotation, and curation"

Development of pigmentation in female Culicoides is broadly indicative of aging, but direct extrapolation to parity is not recommended. For larger samples, a subsampling technique was used. 17 trapping sites are georeferenced to the county level. In most cases, there was a single trap per county.

"Short read RNA-Seq (Anopheles stephensi, aligned to Indian strain)","Assembling the tree of life is a major goal of biology, but progress has been hindered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining the orthologous DNA required for accurate and fully resolved phylogenies. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly-expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36 base-pair sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods, and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,Genomics   Bioinformatics   Parasitology
