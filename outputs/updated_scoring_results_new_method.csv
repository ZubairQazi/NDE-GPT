PADMA also allows biologists to upload their microarray-results and compare it with datasets housed within PADMA. We tested PADMA using a preliminary dataset from Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected fly larvae, and uncovered unexpected trends in gene expression, reshaping our hypothesis.

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Human biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Genomics', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Bioengineering', 'Protein binding sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Agricultural science', 'Human genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Plant biology'}",set(),0.09523809523809523,0.16666666666666666,0.18181818181818182,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Agricultural science', 'Human biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Machine learning', 'Bioengineering', 'Protein binding sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology'}",0.8702533143939394,0.6842105263157895,0.9166666666666666,0.9166666666666666,0.7977322048611111

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Systems medicine', 'Embryology', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Chemistry', 'Mouse clinic', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}",set(),0.1,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,"{'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Systems medicine', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Chemistry', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Embryology', 'RNA'}",0.8833267195767199,0.15384615384615385,0.4666666666666667,0.4666666666666667,0.4122191358024693

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression'}","{'Open science', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Chemistry', 'Metagenomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Open science', 'Microbiology', 'Chemistry', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Metagenomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Microbial ecology', 'Genomics'}",0.944081844081844,0.38461538461538464,0.5,0.5,0.472040922040922

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Critical care medicine', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}",set(),0.15789473684210525,0.3,0.25,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Critical care medicine', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}",0.9085818803863919,1.25,1.2,False,0.0

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Proteins', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Rare diseases', 'RNA'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Physiology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Proteins', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Rare diseases', 'RNA'}",0.8926452735976549,0.575,1.2222222222222223,False,0.0

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Drug development', 'Zoology', 'Biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Synthetic biology', 'Proteins', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Enzymes', 'Genetic variation'}",set(),0.047619047619047616,0.08333333333333333,0.1,"{'Drug development', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'RNA'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Synthetic biology', 'Proteins', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Enzymes', 'Genetic variation'}",0.818726587665981,0.25316455696202533,0.8333333333333334,0.8333333333333334,0.6822721563883176

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes.

Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm.

We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Proteomics', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Proteogenomics', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA'}",set(),0.1,0.2,0.16666666666666666,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Proteomics', 'Animal study', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteogenomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA'}",0.8549492945326281,0.9459459459459459,1.2,False,0.0

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Protein binding sites', 'Human genetics', 'Protein variants'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Physiology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Animal study', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Protein binding sites', 'Human genetics', 'Protein variants'}",0.8696950019677294,0.9642857142857143,1.2222222222222223,False,0.0

Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Drug development', 'Zoology', 'Biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Animal study', 'Neurology', 'Zoology', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.21052631578947367,0.3076923076923077,0.4,"{'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Biology', 'RNA'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Neurology', 'Gene transcripts', 'Proteins', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology'}",0.9716120407640877,0.38461538461538464,0.7692307692307693,0.7692307692307693,0.7473938775108367

In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Mouse clinic', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Small molecules', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}",set(),0.2222222222222222,0.2857142857142857,0.5,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Human genetics', 'Small molecules', 'RNA'}",0.9842757936507939,0.6,0.5714285714285714,0.5714285714285714,0.5624433106575965

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Gene structure', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Plant biology', 'Genetic variation'}",set(),0.2777777777777778,0.4166666666666667,0.45454545454545453,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Gene structure', 'Gene transcripts', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Genetic variation'}",1.0367470624613484,1.3333333333333333,0.9166666666666666,0.9166666666666666,0.9503514739229026

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Embryology', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Synthetic biology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Protein binding sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Human genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.21052631578947367,0.25,0.5714285714285714,"{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Synthetic biology', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Protein binding sites', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Human genetics', 'Embryology'}",0.9940049513514431,0.2,0.4375,0.4375,0.43487716621625633

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression'}","{'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Human genetics', 'Microbial collection', 'Gene expression', 'Plant biology'}",set(),0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Human genetics', 'Microbial collection', 'Plant biology'}",1.0472222222222223,0.2727272727272727,0.5,0.5,0.5236111111111111

With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Virology', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Gene expression', 'Protein variants'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Animal study', 'Pathology', 'Virology', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell culture collection', 'Gene expression', 'Protein variants'}",0.7563213301849663,1.5,1.2,False,0.0

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

We have identified 23 individuals with de novo mutations or deletions of YY1 and phenotypic features that define a syndrome of cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, intrauterine growth restriction, feeding problems, and various congenital malformations. Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation. Collectively, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of YY1 through dysregulation of key transcriptional regulators.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genetics'}","{'DNA binding sites', 'Human biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein binding sites', 'DNA mutation', 'Gene expression', 'Human genetics'}",set(),0.14285714285714285,0.25,0.25,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Genetics'}","{'DNA binding sites', 'DNA mutation', 'Gene regulation', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Gene expression', 'Human genetics'}",0.8988924963924965,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.8988924963924965

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Zoology', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.07692307692307693,0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285,"{'Pathology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Gene regulation', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression'}",0.8362845487845487,1.7692307692307692,1.0,1.0,0.8362845487845487

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells.

To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein interactions', 'Genetics', 'Molecular genetics', 'Mouse clinic', 'Transcriptomics', 'Developmental biology', 'Systems biology', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Cell biology', 'Gene expression'}",{'Stem cells'},0.1,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,"{'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Protein interactions', 'Molecular genetics', 'Mouse clinic', 'Transcriptomics', 'Developmental biology', 'Systems biology', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Cell biology'}",0.89964257964258,0.08333333333333333,0.4666666666666667,0.4666666666666667,0.419833203833204

gpt-3.5-turbo,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression'}","{'Gene regulation', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Gene expression'}","{'Synthetic microbial community', 'Methanotroph', 'Gene expression profiles', 'Microcosm model system', 'Methanol'}",0.25,0.4,0.4,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Environmental sciences'}",1.0392255892255893,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0392255892255893

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genetics'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Phosphorylation'}",0.05555555555555555,0.14285714285714285,0.08333333333333333,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",0.8298174603174604,0.35135135135135137,1.7142857142857142,False,0.0
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Oncology', 'Biotechnology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Genetics'}",set(),0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Oncology', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}",0.9388108902097427,0.1388888888888889,1.2222222222222223,False,0.0

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Immunology', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Genetics', 'Biology'}","{'Pediatrics', 'clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Allergy'}",0.2222222222222222,0.3333333333333333,0.4,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Biology', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology'}",0.9667658730158729,0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8333333333333334,0.8056382275132274

To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Drug development', 'Zoology', 'Biology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'RNA'}","{'Embryology', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Neurobiology'}","{'Epigenetic determinant', 'Neural tube defects', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'Craniofacial development', 'RNA-Seq', 'WNT signaling pathway'}",0.3076923076923077,0.5714285714285714,0.4,"{'Drug development', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'DNA mutation', 'Biology', 'RNA'}","{'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Neurobiology'}",1.0922421714088382,0.38461538461538464,1.4285714285714286,False,0.0

In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics', 'Genetics'}","{'MicroRNA', 'Tumor suppressor', 'Cancer', 'Chemokine receptor', 'Metastasis', 'Migration', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Therapeutic targets', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor'}",0.08333333333333333,0.2,0.125,"{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Genomics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology'}",0.8297335600907032,0.0,1.6,False,0.0

We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

gpt-4,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Evolutionary biology', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Comparative genomics'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Evolutionary biology', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Comparative genomics'}",0.7818831168831171,1.1428571428571428,3.6666666666666665,False,0.0

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biochemistry'}",set(),0.1,0.25,0.14285714285714285,"{'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene expression'}","{'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology'}",0.8273809523809524,0.0,1.75,False,0.0

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Personalised medicine', 'Immunogenetics', 'Haematology', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2,0.2,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Personalised medicine', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Haematology'}",0.863764880952381,0.6,1.0,1.0,0.863764880952381

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Parasitology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Parasitology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites'}",0.7728721194630283,0.6097560975609756,2.0,False,0.0

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics'}",set(),0.058823529411764705,0.14285714285714285,0.09090909090909091,"{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology'}",0.8168875024757384,0.5,1.5714285714285714,False,0.0

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Collectively, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of YY1 through dysregulation of key transcriptional regulators.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genetics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set(),0.08333333333333333,0.2,0.125,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genetics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Carbon cycle', 'Microbial ecology'}",0.8183201058201058,0.0,1.6,False,0.0

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Human biology', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'DNA mutation'}","{'Genetically engineering', 'Cancer research', 'Data analysis'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Human biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics', 'DNA mutation'}",0.7872005772005776,0.25,1.1666666666666667,False,0.0

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Physiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Agricultural science', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Plant biology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression'}","{'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Comparative genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Agricultural science', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Plant biology'}",0.7773910533910536,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.45454545454545453,0.3533595697232062

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Paediatrics', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Genomics', 'Biomedical science', 'Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Embryology'}",set(),0.13333333333333333,0.2,0.2857142857142857,"{'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene expression'}","{'Embryology', 'Paediatrics', 'Cell biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Genomics', 'Biomedical science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",0.8783219954648529,0.029411764705882353,0.7,0.7,0.6148253968253969

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

mixtral-8x7b-model,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Computational chemistry', 'Data mining', 'Biophysics', 'Biochemistry', 'Computer science', 'Sequence analysis', 'Microbial ecology', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Infectious disease', 'Biotechnology', 'Machine learning', 'Biomedical science', 'Small molecules', 'Database management', 'Molecular biology', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Pharmacology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Microbiology', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Data visualisation', 'Structural genomics', 'Computational biology', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Translational research', 'Biochemical research', 'Research administration and management', 'Biochemical techniques and instrumentation', 'Lab animal science techniques'}",0.15151515151515152,0.19230769230769232,0.4166666666666667,"{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Proteins'}","{'Computational chemistry', 'Data mining', 'Biophysics', 'Computer science', 'Microbial ecology', 'Genomics', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Infectious disease', 'Biotechnology', 'Machine learning', 'Biomedical science', 'Small molecules', 'Database management', 'Molecular biology', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Microbiology', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Data visualisation', 'Structural genomics', 'Computational biology'}",0.9007000507000509,0.37037037037037035,0.46153846153846156,0.46153846153846156,0.4157077157077158
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Systems medicine', 'Omics', 'Oncology', 'Biotechnology', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Immunology', 'Biomedical science', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Immune function', 'Neurology/central nervous system', 'Biologics and pharmaceuticals'}",0.05555555555555555,0.125,0.09090909090909091,"{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Systems medicine', 'Omics', 'Oncology', 'Biotechnology', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Biomedical science', 'Biomarkers'}",0.7904653679653685,0.16666666666666666,1.375,False,0.0

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology'}","{'Data governance', 'Database management', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data visualisation', 'Data mining', 'Data security', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data rescue', 'Data quality management', 'Data management'}","{'Data submission', 'and curation', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data architecture', 'annotation', 'analysis and design'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics'}","{'Data governance', 'Database management', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data visualisation', 'Data mining', 'Data security', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data rescue', 'Data quality management', 'Data management'}",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

mixtral-8x7b-model,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Drug development', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene regulation', 'Developmental biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'RNA'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Pathology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Developmental biology', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene transcripts', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'RNA', 'Bioengineering', 'Laboratory information management', 'Immunogenetics', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurology', 'Gene structure', 'Gene regulation', 'Evolutionary biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Epigenetics'}",set(),0.21428571428571427,0.25,0.6,"{'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Pathology', 'Epigenetics', 'Neurology', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene structure', 'Biotechnology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Bioengineering', 'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Genomics', 'Laboratory information management', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Neurobiology', 'Epigenomics'}",0.9979882862235809,0.1724137931034483,0.4166666666666667,0.4166666666666667,0.41582845259315876

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.","{'Biomarkers', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Protein binding sites'}","{'Biomolecular simulation', 'Genetics', 'Animal study', 'Cell biology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Biomarkers', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Protein binding sites'}","{'Biomolecular simulation', 'Genetics', 'Animal study', 'Cell biology'}",0.7440724206349207,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.7440724206349207

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Virology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genetics', 'Genetic variation', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Biomedical science', 'Cell biology', 'Proteomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Gene structure', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Proteins', 'Medicine'}",set(),0.038461538461538464,0.05263157894736842,0.125,"{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Proteomics', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Virology', 'Gene structure', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Transcriptomics', 'Proteins', 'Medicine', 'Biomedical science', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genetic variation'}",0.8156318005057495,0.4,0.42105263157894735,0.42105263157894735,0.3434239160024208

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Gene expression', 'Biochemistry', 'Functional genomics', 'Computer science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Genetic variation'}",set(),0.1875,0.3,0.3333333333333333,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Functional genomics', 'Computer science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Biology', 'Genetic variation'}",0.9535346320346322,0.19047619047619047,0.9,0.9,0.858181168831169

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Zoology', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Animal study', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.625,0.8333333333333334,0.7142857142857143,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.2589285714285714,0.0,1.1666666666666667,False,0.0

perfect_match,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression'}","{'Carbon cycle', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.8,1.0,0.8,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.8,0.0,1.25,False,0.0

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Physiology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}","{'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genetics'}",set(),0.7692307692307693,0.9090909090909091,0.8333333333333334,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.4031593406593408,0.0,1.0909090909090908,False,0.0

Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Physiology', 'Zoology', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Pharmacology', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoinformatics'}",set(),0.75,0.9,0.8181818181818182,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.3839285714285714,0.0,1.1,False,0.0

In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs.

Among several metabolites formed, 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium. Although sulcotrione has a chemical structure closely resembling that of mesotrione, the isolates were unable to degrade it.","{'Ecology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Microbial ecology'}",set(),0.8,1.0,0.8,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.8,0.0,1.25,False,0.0
perfect_match,"Many cellular models aimed at elucidating cancer biology do not recapitulate pathobiology including tumor heterogeneity, an inherent feature of cancer that underlies treatment resistance. Here we introduce a cancer modeling paradigm using genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that captures authentic cancer pathobiology. Orthotopic engraftment of the neural progenitor cells derived from hiPSCs that have been genome-edited to contain tumor-associated genetic driver mutations revealed by The Cancer Genome Atlas project for glioblastoma (GBM) results in formation of high-grade gliomas. Similar to patient-derived GBM, these models harbor inter-tumor heterogeneity resembling different GBM molecular subtypes, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and extrachromosomal DNA amplification. Re-engraftment of these primary tumor neurospheres generates secondary tumors with features characteristic of patient samples and present mutation-dependent patterns of tumor evolution. These cancer avatar models provide a platform for comprehensive longitudinal assessment of human tumor development as governed by molecular subtype mutations and lineage-restricted differentiation.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic engineering'}","{'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic engineering'}",set(),0.7,0.875,0.7777777777777778,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.3339285714285714,0.0,1.125,False,0.0
perfect_match,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Microbiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Sequence analysis'}","{'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis'}",set(),0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.6666666666666666,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.5,False,0.0

perfect_match,"In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the switch from asexual multiplication to sexual differentiation into gametocytes is essential for transmission to mosquitos. The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion. Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a second transcription factor, PfAP2-I. These results clarify the functional role of PfAP2-G during sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis.","{'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Parasitology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Parasitology', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.8333333333333334,1.0,0.8333333333333334,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.8333333333333334,0.0,1.2,False,0.0

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Physiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology'}","{'Physiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology'}",set(),0.8,1.0,0.8,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.8,0.0,1.25,False,0.0

perfect_match,"Adipocytes arise from the commitment and differentiation of adipose precursors in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.","{'Biomarkers', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology', 'Protein binding sites'}","{'Biomarkers', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites'}",set(),0.4,0.6666666666666666,0.5,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.0339285714285715,0.0,1.3333333333333333,False,0.0
perfect_match,"Tumor suppressive microRNA (miR)-150 inhibits metastasis by combining with the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) ""seed sequence"" mRNA of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Pathology', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.6666666666666666,0.8571428571428571,0.75,"{'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}",{'Animal study'},1.3005952380952381,0.0,1.1428571428571428,False,0.0
perfect_match,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression'}",set(),0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.8888888888888888,{'Drug metabolism'},set(),0.8888888888888888,0.0,1.125,False,0.0
