Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) - Dataset update released August 2021,"ACTT is a clinical trial platform sponsored by NIAID to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The studies are a multicenter trial and will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The studies will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm.  New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.   The initial iteration of ACTT (ACTT-1) evaluated Remdesivir vs placebo.  Participants had to have a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and meet one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrollment: radiographic infiltrates by imaging study, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).   Remdesivir was administered intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose administered daily on days 2 through 10 or until hospital discharge or death. A matching placebo was administered according to the same schedule and in the same volume as the active drug. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites: United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1).   Participants were assessed daily during their hospitalization, from day 1 through day 29. The participant’s clinical status on an eight-category ordinal scale, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and other clinical data was recorded each day. All serious adverse events and grade 3 or 4 adverse events that represented an increase in severity from day 1 and any grade 2 or higher suspected drug-related hypersensitivity reactions were recorded. Upon discharge, participants had intermittent study visits through Day 29.  The final follow-up for all participants was Day 29.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Infectious disease, Clinical trial, Public health and epidemiology"
Safety and Immunogenicity Study of 2019-nCoV Vaccine (mRNA-1273) for Prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19),"This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic clinical research sites. One hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg). Subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Immunology, Infectious disease, Vaccinology"

The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced.  ACTT-2 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to remdesivir alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized). The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. Each stage may prioritize different secondary endpoints for the purpose of multiple comparison analyses.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Infectious disease, Clinical trials, Public health and epidemiology"
Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial 3 (ACTT-3) - New dataset released October 2021,"This study is an adaptive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs. There will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced. One independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data in all stages to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.  ACTT-3 will evaluate the combination of interferon beta-1a and remdesivir compared to remdesivir alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data.

ACTIV-1 IM - Immune Modulators for Treating COVID-19 - September 2023,"The ACTIV-1 (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) clinical trial enrolled 1971 patients at over 80 sites in the US and Latin America between October 2020 and December 2021.  Subjects were randomized to one of the substudies currently active in the study, and then to either the investigational agent (abatacept, infliximab, cenicriviroc) or its matching placebo. The study analyses compared each active therapy against a pooled placebo population consisting of placebo recipients from all three sub-studies (those accrued during the time the sub-study was actively enrolling). The efficacy of each therapeutic agent as add-on therapy to standard of care was evaluated based on the primary endpoint of time to recovery by Day 29. Key secondary objectives of this study were mortality and clinical improvement. Comparisons of the agents among themselves was not a research objective.  The cenicriviroc (CVC) sub-study was closed to enrollment on September 3, 2021, due to futility.  Evaluations of efficacy also included 8-point Ordinal Scale, incidence, and duration of new oxygen use, and (as an exploratory assessment) National Early Warning Score (NEWS). Safety was evaluated with laboratory and adverse event assessments, as well as evaluations of extrapulmonary manifestations.  Blood was collected at select sites for future secondary research.  Trial participants were assessed daily while hospitalized through Day 29 or discharge. Outpatient follow-up study visits occurred on Days 8, 11, 15 and 29. Follow up assessments by phone occurred at Days 22 and 60 to assess clinical status and adverse events.  The results for this study are available as three separate datasets, one for each sub-study. Enrollment numbers for each sub-study, including the randomization within each sub-study (active vs. matched placebo) and the pooled placebo population for analysis, are as follows:  For Abatacept: Active Drug: 524; Matched Placebo: 214; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 525.  For Infliximab: Active Drug: 531; Matched Placebo: 215; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 530.  For CVC: Active Drug: 360; Matched Placebo: 127; Pooled Placebo (across all sub-studies): 363.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Immunology, Infectious disease, Clinical trials"

SDY1760 – Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) - A Prospective Cohort Study to Assess Longitudinal Immune Responses in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 - Dataset Released August 2022,"This was a prospective observational cohort surveillance study of approximately 1100 adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19. Detailed information was collected regarding patient history and onset of illness upon enrollment. Participants had longitudinal assessments of clinical status, and pertinent clinical data (including clinical laboratory values, radiographic findings, medication use, oxygen and ventilatory support requirements, complications, etc.) was recorded. In parallel, the study conducted serial biologic sampling for detailed immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive picture of immune changes that occurred throughout the course of infection. The biologic samples collected for this observational study included blood, nasal swabs, and endotracheal aspirates. Participants were followed in hospital through Day 28, unless discharged earlier. If a participant required an escalation to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level care, either within or outside of a dedicated ICU, additional samples were collected within 24 and 96 hours of care escalation. Convalescent questionnaires and biologic samples were collected at 3-month intervals up to Month 12 after discharge, if available. In addition, if a participant was discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28, attempts were made to collect additional scheduled assessments through Day 28 on an outpatient basis, if feasible.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Infectious disease, Immunology, Clinical medicine"
