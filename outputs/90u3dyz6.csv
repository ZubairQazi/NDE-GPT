SHINE Cluster Randomized Trial,"The SHINE trial was a cluster-randomized trial that sought to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on length and hemoglobin concentrations among children at 18 months of age living in 2 rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as a catchment area of 1-4 community-based village health workers from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Clusters were randomized to one of four intervention arms - 1) standard of care, 2) infant and young child feeding intervention (IYCF), 3) WASH intervention, and 4) combined IYCF + WASH. Data collection was performed at baseline, 32 weeks gestation and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months postpartum.","Infectious disease, Public health and epidemiology, Preclinical and clinical studies",gpt-3.5-turbo,"Environmental sciences, Epidemiology, Pediatrics",Environmental sciences
