ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Human genetics', 'Agricultural science', 'Infectious disease', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Human biology', 'Machine learning', 'Proteins', 'Bioengineering', 'Bioinformatics', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.09523809523809523,0.16666666666666666,0.18181818181818182,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Agricultural science', 'Infectious disease', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Human biology', 'Machine learning', 'Bioengineering', 'Bioinformatics'}",49.69621212121213,0.6842105263157895,45.554861111111116

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Sequence assembly', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Systems medicine', 'Animal study', 'Regenerative medicine', 'RNA', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression', 'Model organisms', 'Cell biology', 'Mouse clinic', 'Membrane and lipoproteins'}",set(),0.1,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,"{'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Zoology'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Chemistry', 'Systems medicine', 'Cell biology', 'Regenerative medicine', 'RNA', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Model organisms', 'Animal study', 'Mouse clinic', 'Membrane and lipoproteins'}",47.09960317460319,0.15384615384615385,21.979814814814823

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Open science', 'Genomics', 'Carbon cycle', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Metagenomics', 'Membrane and lipoproteins'}",set(),0.15384615384615385,0.2,0.4,"{'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Open science', 'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Metagenomics', 'Membrane and lipoproteins'}",14.378088578088583,0.38461538461538464,7.189044289044292

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Critical care medicine', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.15789473684210525,0.3,0.25,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Critical care medicine', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Animal study'}",47.45118478013217,1.25,56.941421736158595

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Rare diseases', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sequence analysis', 'RNA', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Rare diseases', 'Proteins'}",49.34776334776338,0.575,60.313932980599695

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Enzymes', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.047619047619047616,0.08333333333333333,0.1,"{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Biology'}","{'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Enzymes', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Sequence analysis', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Animal study'}",76.38726551226549,0.25316455696202533,63.65605459355457

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Microbial ecology', 'Metagenomics', 'Electron microscopy'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Microbial ecology', 'Metagenomics', 'Electron microscopy'}",7.083333333333334,0.0,7.083333333333334

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Plant biology', 'Mapping', 'Human biology', 'Microfluidics', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.2222222222222222,0.2857142857142857,0.5,"{'Pathology', 'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Human genetics', 'Protein disordered structure', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cell culture collection', 'Plant biology', 'Mapping', 'Microfluidics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study'}",30.631385281385295,0.48148148148148145,17.503648732220167

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes.

Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm.

We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteogenomics', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.1,0.2,0.16666666666666666,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteogenomics', 'Respiratory medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA', 'Animal study'}",54.45634920634923,0.9459459459459459,65.34761904761908

This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein variants', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Protein binding sites', 'Protein variants', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Animal study'}",41.83322510822512,0.9642857142857143,51.129497354497374

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'DNA packaging', 'DNA mutation', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Zoology', 'Animal study', 'DNA polymorphism'}",set(),0.2,0.2222222222222222,0.6666666666666666,{'Genetics'},"{'Laboratory animal science', 'DNA packaging', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Animal study', 'DNA polymorphism'}",5.467857142857143,2.5,1.8226190476190478

A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Neurology', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Animal study', 'Gene transcripts'}",set(),0.21052631578947367,0.3076923076923077,0.4,"{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'DNA mutation', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Biology'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Neurology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Gene transcripts'}",41.309155464418644,0.38461538461538464,31.77627343416819

In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Human genetics', 'Gene regulation', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.13333333333333333,0.25,0.2222222222222222,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Human biology', 'RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Transcriptomics'}",27.828571428571436,0.7142857142857143,31.307142857142864

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Gene structure', 'Genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Gene expression', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene transcripts', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.2777777777777778,0.4166666666666667,0.45454545454545453,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Microbiology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Genomics', 'Gene structure', 'Plant biology', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene transcripts'}",26.84170274170275,1.3333333333333333,24.60489417989419

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Sequence assembly', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Human genetics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Animal study', 'Drug metabolism', 'Cell culture collection', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology'}",set(),0.21052631578947367,0.25,0.5714285714285714,"{'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly'}","{'Human genetics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Sequence analysis', 'Protein binding sites', 'Cell biology', 'Cell culture collection', 'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Embryology', 'Proteins', 'Animal study'}",28.415757196020362,0.2,12.431893773258908

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Human genetics', 'Microbial collection', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Plant biology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology'}",set(),0.25,0.3,0.6,"{'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Human genetics', 'Microbial collection', 'Plant biology', 'Human biology', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology', 'Microbial ecology'}",11.411111111111113,0.2727272727272727,5.705555555555557

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::8SAHvdnS,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Virology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Protein variants', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Virology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Protein variants', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'DNA binding sites', 'Gene expression', 'Animal study'}",83.1953463203463,1.5,99.83441558441557

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Human biology', 'Sample collections', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set(),0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Gene regulation', 'Sample collections', 'Proteins', 'Animal study'}",36.19086452762924,0.45454545454545453,44.233278867102406

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm.

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Environmental sciences', 'Gene regulation', 'Carbon cycle', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology'}","{'Gene expression profiles', 'Methanol', 'Microcosm model system', 'Methanotroph', 'Synthetic microbial community'}",0.25,0.4,0.4,"{'Proteins', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Gene regulation'}",4.985353535353536,1.0,4.985353535353536

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics'}","{'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal transduction'}",0.05555555555555555,0.14285714285714285,0.08333333333333333,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Virology', 'Infectious disease', 'Proteomics', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",38.7686507936508,0.35135135135135137,66.46054421768709
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Oncology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Pharmacology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",set(),0.17647058823529413,0.3333333333333333,0.2727272727272727,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Oncology', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",31.432422969187694,0.1388888888888889,38.417405851229404
gpt-3.5-turbo,"DNA recombination is required for effective segregation and diversification of genomes and for the successful completion of meiosis. Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'DNA replication and recombination', 'Comparative genomics', 'Genomics', 'DNA'}","{'Sex evolution', 'Hybrid incompatibilities', 'Sequence homology', 'Genome evolution', 'Molecular basis'}",0.16666666666666666,0.25,0.3333333333333333,"{'Genetics', 'Zoology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Genomics', 'DNA'}",4.861111111111112,2.0,3.645833333333334

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Biology'}","{'Pediatrics', 'clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics', 'Allergy'}",0.2222222222222222,0.3333333333333333,0.4,"{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology'}",9.156746031746033,0.0,7.630621693121695

To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Neurobiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Gene expression'}","{'RNA-Seq', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'Neural tube defects', 'Craniofacial development'}",0.3076923076923077,0.5714285714285714,0.4,"{'Drug development', 'DNA mutation', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Epigenetics', 'Embryology', 'Neurobiology'}",14.429589854589855,0.38461538461538464,20.613699792271223

We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6.

Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Systems biology', 'Bioinformatics'}","{'Antibiotic resistance', 'Genetic network engineering', 'Drug target predictions'}",0.07692307692307693,0.2,0.1111111111111111,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Systems biology', 'Genomics', 'Bioinformatics'}",16.055494505494504,0.16666666666666666,28.89989010989011

gpt-4,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Proteins', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Gene expression', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Evolutionary biology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}",23.456493506493512,1.1428571428571428,86.00714285714288
gpt-4,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Genetics', 'Biochemistry'}",set(),0.1,0.25,0.14285714285714285,"{'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Biochemistry'}",13.192857142857143,0.0,23.0875

Under naturally timed photoperiod conditions, we maintained captive Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the ventral hypothalamus and optic chiasma to evaluate transcriptome-wide gene expression changes of individuals in migratory condition. We found that 188 genes were differentially expressed in relation to migratory state, 86% of which have not been previously linked to avian migration. Focal hub genes were identified that are candidate variables responsible for the occurrence of migration (e.g. CRABP1).

gpt-4,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Gene expression', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Haematology', 'Personalised medicine', 'Immunogenetics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular biology'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2,0.2,"{'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Personalised medicine', 'Immunogenetics', 'Haematology'}",12.153571428571432,0.6,12.153571428571432

gpt-4,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Gene regulation', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genomics', 'Parasitology', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Parasitology', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology'}",51.009559884559856,0.6097560975609756,102.01911976911971
gpt-4,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.058823529411764705,0.14285714285714285,0.09090909090909091,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Infectious disease', 'Molecular biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}",45.54266191325018,0.5,71.56704014939314
gpt-4,"DNA recombination is required for effective segregation and diversification of genomes and for the successful completion of meiosis. Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Epigenomics', 'Oncology', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",{'Data analysis'},0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'DNA replication and recombination'}","{'Epigenomics', 'Oncology', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",14.192929292929298,0.2857142857142857,6.082683982683984

A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'DNA', 'Genomics', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Biochemistry', 'DNA binding sites', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology'}","{'DNA', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Genomics', 'Biochemistry', 'DNA binding sites', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology'}",27.018722943722953,0.4583333333333333,19.299087816944965

Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

gpt-4,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Genetic variation', 'Gene regulation', 'Molecular genetics', 'Epigenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology'}",set(),0.058823529411764705,0.125,0.1,"{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Human genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Epigenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell biology', 'Genetic variation'}",48.04980477039304,0.3125,60.0622559629913

In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport. This analysis offers the first detailed insight into how DIR may impact the Fe geochemistry and isotope composition of a Fe-rich, circumneutral pH geothermal environment.","{'Microbiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Microbiology', 'Biochemistry'}",{'Geology'},0.25,0.5,0.3333333333333333,"{'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism'}",{'Biochemistry'},1.5178571428571428,0.0,2.2767857142857144

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Biology', 'Plant biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Gene regulation', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Plant biology', 'Functional genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Transcriptomics'}",38.86955266955269,0.13636363636363635,17.66797848616031

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Genomics', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics'}",set(),0.07692307692307693,0.16666666666666666,0.125,"{'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Zoology'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'Genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Functional genomics'}",22.2420745920746,0.5555555555555556,29.65609945609947

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Agricultural science', 'Toxicology', 'Biochemistry', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Microbiology'}",set(),0.07692307692307693,0.2,0.1111111111111111,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Toxicology', 'Microbiology', 'Agricultural science', 'Analytical chemistry'}",17.14478021978022,0.0,30.860604395604398

mixtral-8x7b-model,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Agricultural science', 'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Pathology', 'Biotechnology', 'Gene expression', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",{'Host-pathogen interactions'},0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.18181818181818182,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene regulation', 'Chemistry', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Agricultural science', 'Genomics', 'Pathology', 'Biotechnology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",35.86904761904764,0.11627906976744186,43.839947089947124
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Gene regulation', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Genetics', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Genetics', 'Biomedical science', 'Genomics', 'Embryology', 'Cell biology', 'Paediatrics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",set(),0.13333333333333333,0.2,0.2857142857142857,"{'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Drug metabolism', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Genomics', 'Embryology', 'Cell biology', 'Paediatrics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",26.20793650793652,0.029411764705882353,18.345555555555563

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Carbon cycle'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Biosciences', 'Gene expression', 'Bioinformatics'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.2,0.2,"{'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Biosciences', 'Bioinformatics'}",6.119047619047619,0.3333333333333333,6.119047619047619

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Biomedical science', 'Genetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Machine learning', 'Sequence analysis', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Molecular genetics', 'Data mining', 'Database management', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Genomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Molecular biology', 'Microbiology', 'Computer science', 'Infectious disease', 'Structural genomics', 'Computational biology', 'Computational chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biophysics', 'Small molecules', 'Data visualisation'}","{'Lab animal science techniques', 'Biochemical research', 'Translational research', 'Biochemical techniques and instrumentation', 'Research administration and management'}",0.15151515151515152,0.19230769230769232,0.4166666666666667,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Proteins', 'Zoology'}","{'Biomedical science', 'Machine learning', 'Biotechnology', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Data mining', 'Database management', 'Bioinformatics', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular biology', 'Computer science', 'Infectious disease', 'Structural genomics', 'Computational biology', 'Computational chemistry', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biophysics', 'Small molecules', 'Data visualisation'}",55.591197691197706,0.37037037037037035,25.657475857475866

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'DNA mutation', 'Immunology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Genetics', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Biotherapeutics', 'Omics', 'Immunology', 'Systems medicine', 'Oncology', 'Biomedical science', 'Biotechnology', 'Biomarkers'}","{'Neurology/central nervous system', 'Biologics and pharmaceuticals', 'Immune function'}",0.05555555555555555,0.125,0.09090909090909091,"{'DNA mutation', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Physiology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology'}","{'Biotherapeutics', 'Omics', 'Systems medicine', 'Biomedical science', 'Oncology', 'Biotechnology', 'Biomarkers'}",51.49924242424243,0.16666666666666666,70.81145833333335

Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Data governance', 'Data management', 'Data rescue', 'Data security', 'Database management', 'Data mining', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data quality management', 'Data visualisation'}","{'annotation', 'analysis and design', 'Data architecture, analysis and design', 'Data architecture', 'and curation', 'Data submission'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Immunology', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Immunogenetics', 'Human biology'}","{'Data governance', 'Data management', 'Data rescue', 'Data security', 'Database management', 'Data mining', 'Data identity and mapping', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data quality management', 'Data visualisation'}",0.0,0.0,0.0
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are implicated in tumor neovascularization, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. To illuminate mechanisms governing these hallmark features, we developed a de novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model derived from immortalized human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) to enable precise system-level comparisons of pre-malignant and oncogene-induced malignant states of NSCs. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence. Thus, the PAX6/DLX5-WNT5A axis governs the diffuse spread of glioma cells throughout the brain parenchyma, contributing to the lethality of GBM.","{'Gene regulation', 'Epigenomics', 'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Genetics', 'Biomedical science', 'Oncology', 'Computational biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data visualisation'}",{'Data analysis'},0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.125,"{'Gene regulation', 'Epigenomics', 'Genomics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Biomedical science', 'Oncology', 'Computational biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data visualisation'}",19.850793650793655,0.0,22.68662131519275
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'Gene regulation', 'DNA mutation', 'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'RNA', 'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Biology'}","{'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Neurology', 'Epigenomics', 'Biomedical science', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Genetics', 'Gene structure', 'Pathology', 'RNA', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioengineering', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene transcripts', 'Transcriptomics', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Genomics', 'Laboratory information management', 'Biology', 'Neurobiology', 'DNA mutation', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell biology'}",set(),0.21428571428571427,0.25,0.6,"{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Drug development', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Laboratory animal science', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurology', 'Epigenomics', 'Biomedical science', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Gene structure', 'Genomics', 'Laboratory information management', 'Pathology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Epigenetics', 'Biotechnology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Bioengineering', 'Cell biology', 'Gene transcripts'}",53.50606060606065,0.1724137931034483,22.294191919191938

Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation. Collectively, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of YY1 through dysregulation of key transcriptional regulators.","{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Genetics', 'Data management', 'Genomics', 'Biomedical science', 'Biomolecular simulation', 'Computational biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}","{'analysis and design', 'Data architecture'}",0.06666666666666667,0.125,0.125,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Protein binding sites', 'Drug metabolism', 'Biochemistry', 'Human biology', 'Molecular genetics'}","{'Data management', 'Biomedical science', 'Genomics', 'Computational biology', 'Biomolecular simulation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology'}",20.68531746031746,0.07142857142857142,20.68531746031746

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Pathology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Zoology', 'Drug metabolism'}",set(),{'Clinical (Immunology)'},0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Drug metabolism', 'Pathology', 'Proteins', 'Microbiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Zoology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,

The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione.

mixtral-8x7b-model,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell invasion.

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Human biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Gene expression', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism'}","{'Biomedical science', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Genetics'}",{'haematology'},0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Gene regulation', 'Physiology', 'Drug metabolism', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression'}","{'Biomedical science', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Genetics'}",13.346031746031745,0.0,16.68253968253968

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged.

While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude.
