Understanding Cultivar-Specificity and Soil Determinants of the Cannabis Microbiome,"This is a preliminary study to examine the microbiota associated with the Cannabis plant. Soils samples from the bulk soil, soil associated with the roots, and the rhizosphere were extracted and the DNA sequenced. Roots from three independent plants of different strains were examined. These roots were obtained November 11, 2011 from plants that had been harvested in the summer. Future studies will attempt to analyze the soils and rhizospheres from the same location at different time points in the plant lifecycle.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Plant biology', 'Agricultural science'}",{'Soil science'}
The microbiome of uncontacted Amerindians,"Most studies of the human microbiome have focused on westernized people with life-style practices that decrease microbial survival and transmission, or on traditional societies that are currently in transition to westernization. We characterize the fecal, oral, and skin bacterial microbiome and resistome of members of an isolated Yanomami Amerindian village with no documented previous contact with Western people. These Yanomami harbor a microbiome with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. Despite their isolation, presumably for >11,000 years since their ancestors arrived in South America, and no known exposure to antibiotics, they harbor bacteria that carry functional antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, including those that confer resistance to synthetic antibiotics and are syntenic with mobilization elements. These results suggest that westernization significantly affects human microbiome diversity and that functional AR genes appear to be a feature of the human microbiome even in the absence of exposure to commercial antibiotics. AR genes are likely poised for mobilization and enrichment upon exposure to pharmacological levels of antibiotics. Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Changes in Microbial Ecology after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for recurrent C. difficile Infection Affected by Underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Gut microbiota play a key role in maintaining homeostasis in the human gut and alterations in the gut microbial ecosystem predispose to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and gut inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor can restore gut microbial diversity and pathogen colonization resistance and is being investigated for its ability to improve inflammatory gut conditions such as IBD.  In this study, we investigated changes in gut microbiota following FMT in 38 patients with CDI with or without underlying IBD. Following FMT that successfully treated CDI, there was a significant change in gut microbial composition towards the donor microbiota and an overall increase in microbial diversity consistent with previous studies. FMT was successful in treating CDI using a diverse set of donors and varying degrees of donor stool engraftment suggesting donor type and degree of engraftment were not key for successful FMT treatment of CDI. However, in patients with underlying IBD, there was significantly lower expansion of new taxa and higher proportion of original community and more CDI relapses after FMT during a 24-month follow up. Moreover, the need for therapy for IBD did not change following FMT. These results suggest that changes in gut microbial landscape may be important for long term success of CDI treatment in patients with underlying IBD and potentially for improvement of underlying pathophysiology in IBD.

The Fecal Microbial Community of Breast-fed Infants from Armenia and Georgia,"Oligosaccharides from breast milk are believed to help shape the infant intestinal microbiota through their ability to feed specific bacterial groups, in particular Bifidobacterium. In a subset of mothers the fucosyltransferase 2 (“secretor”) gene is mutationally inactivated, which leads to milk lacking 2’ fucosylated glycans and was previously shown to impact microbial colonization of the neonate gut. Similarly, infants may receive distinct individual bacterial exposures which influence their gut communities over time. Here we study the infant gut microbiota through a longitudinal study on cohorts of breast-fed infants from the neighboring countries of Armenia and Georgia. Marker gene sequencing of 16S ribosomal genes revealed that the gut microbial communities of infants from these countries were dominated by bifidobacteria, were different from each other, and were marginally influenced by their mother’s secretor status. Species-level differences in the bifidobacterial communities of each country and birth method were also observed. These community differences suggest that environmental variation between individuals in different locations may influence the gut microbiota of infants, possibly through selection or seeding differences.

"Effects of Management, Soil Attributes and Region on Soil Microbial Communities in Vineyards (Napa, California, USA)","Soil microorganisms play an important role in soil health. However, little is known about the relationship between soil microbial community composition and diversity and commercially significant aspects of soil health. The purpose of this study is to: (1) assess the impact of management practices on both biotic and abiotic soil characteristics in winegrape vineyard soils in Napa Valley, CA, and (2) identify which soil features mediate shifts in bacterial community structure. Bacterial community composition was estimated using a culture-independent analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance of the weighted UniFrac distance matrix showed that the bacterial communities clustered as a function of tillage and cover crop type. In addition, the bacterial communities are patterned along gradients of soil chemical properties, i.e. pH and pools of carbon and nitrogen, and by soil type (US Soil Taxonomy) and region (American Viticultural Area). The results presented here establish a framework for future research in: (1) understanding microbial roles in soil quality, (2) using DNA fingerprinting for soil health assessment and maintenance in perennial cropping systems, and (3) investigating soil microbial community composition as a potential factor in influencing wine terroir.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Ecology', 'Agricultural science'}",{'Soil microbiology'}
Diet Shapes the Gut Microbiome of Pigs During Nursing and Weaning.,"Background.  The newborn mammal is rapidly colonized by a complex microbial community, whose importance for host health is becoming increasingly clear.  Understanding the forces that shape the early community, especially during the nursing period, is critical to understand how this consortium of microbes is assembled. Pigs present an attractive model for nursing humans, given physiological similarity and the compositional similarity of pig milk and human milk oligosaccharides and their utility in experimental studies.  However, there is a paucity of data examining the gut microbiome in nursing pigs from birth through weaning using modern molecular methods, and fewer experimental studies that examine the impact of diet on these microbial communities.  
Results. We characterized the fecal microbiome of pigs from birth through 7 weeks of age, during which the animals were transitioned from an exclusive diet of sow milk to a starter diet composed of plant and animal-based components.  Microbial communities were clearly distinguishable based on diet, being relatively stable absent dietary changes. Metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize a subset of animals before and after weaning, which identified glycan degradation pathways differing significantly between diets.  Predicted enzymes active on milk-derived glycans that are otherwise indigestible to the host animal were enriched in the microbial metagenome of milk-fed animals.  In contrast, the metagenome of weaned animals was enriched in functional pathways involved in plant glycan deconstruction and consumption.  
Conclusions. The gut microbiome in young pigs is dramatically shaped by the composition of dietary glycans, reflected by the different functional capacities of the microbiome before and after weaning.

Structure and Function of the Bacterial Root Microbiota in Wild and Domesticated Barley,"The microbial communities inhabiting the interior of roots of healthy plants, as well as
the rhizosphere, i.e., particles of soil firmly attached to roots, engage in symbiotic
associations with their host. We employed a combination of 16S rRNA gene profiling
and shotgun metagenome analysis to investigate the structural and functional
diversification of the microbiota associated with wild and domesticated accessions of
barley (Hordeum vulgare). This revealed that the bacterial families Comamonadaceae,
Flavobacteriaceae, and Rhizobiaceae dominate the barley root-enriched microbiota.
Host genotype has a small but significant effect on the diversity of root-associated
bacterial communities, possibly representing a footprint of barley domestication. Traits
related to pathogenesis, secretion, phage interactions and nutrient mobilization are
enriched in the barley root-associated microbiota. Strikingly, protein families assigned
to the same traits showed evidence of positive selection. Our results indicate that the
combined action of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions drives microbiota
differentiation at the root-soil interface.

Succession of microbial consortia in the developing infant gut microbiome,"The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-year case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome could be attributed to life events.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular biology'}",set()

"Associations among Wine Grape Microbiome, Metabolome, and Fermentation Behavior Suggest Microbial Contribution to Regional Wine Characteristics","Regionally distinct wine characteristics (terroir) are an important aspect of wine production and consumer appreciation. Microbial activity is an integral part of wine production, and grape and wine microbiota present regionally defined patterns associated with vineyard and climatic conditions, but the degree to which these microbial patterns associate with the chemical composition of wine is unclear. Through a longitudinal survey of over 200 commercial wine fermentations, we demonstrate that both grape microbiota and wine metabolite profiles distinguish viticultural area designations and individual vineyards within Napa and Sonoma Counties, California. Associations among wine microbiota and fermentation characteristics suggest new links between microbiota, fermentation performance, and wine properties. The bacterial and fungal consortia of wine fermentations, composed from vineyard and winery sources, correlate with the chemical composition of the finished wines and predict metabolite abundances in finished wines using machine learning models. The use of postharvest microbiota as an early predictor of wine chemical composition is unprecedented and potentially poses a new paradigm for quality control of agricultural products.

"Comparative microbiome of Triatama infestans, vector of Chagas disease","The microbiota of the insect gut has been shown to be important for several vector-pathogen relationships; for example, the bacterium Wolbachia has profound effects on mosquito life span and fitness as a vector of dengue and other infections. Triatomine bugs are the vector of Chagas disease, a chronic parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi that affects 8-12 million Latin Americans. We used deep sequencing to describe the hindgut microbiome of the most important vector of T. cruzi, Triatoma infestans. We compared the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome of 3 groups of triatomines: 1) lab-raised T. cruzi-infected bug, 2) lab-raised T. cruzi-uninfected bugs, and 3) uninfected bugs caught in households in Arequipa, Peru. We conducted amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of bacterial 16S RNA using an Ion Torrent. We analyzed 3-4 bugs per group, using 2-3 replicate PCRs per sample from each bug. Diversity between individuals and groups was then compared using MG-RAST, EstimateS, and. Rarefaction curves were approaching their asymptote suggesting most genera were likely detected in the majority of samples. The microbiomes of wild-caught triatomines were more diverse than the microbiomes of either lab-raised group, though this was largely driven by samples from one very diverse fifth-stage nymph with more than 300 species (twice that of the next most-diverse sample). Enterococcus and Arsenophonus were the predominant genera found in lab raised bugs, with the exception of one T. cruzi-uninfected bug where Morganella predominated. In contrast, there was no one predominant genus identified in wild-caught bugs, and Enterococcus and Enterbacteriaciae were not substantial components. There were not large differences in diversity between lab-raised T. cruzi-infected and -uninfected triatomines. Future studies should examine geographic differences in triatomine microbiome composition and diversity, microbiome changes with bug stage and infection status both in the lab and in the wild, and the effect of antibiotic-mediated disruption of the triatomine gut on susceptibility to infection by T. cruzi.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Human biology', 'Parasitology'}",set()

"Characterizing the gut microbiome of the last population of undomesticated horses living in the wild, the Przewalski horse","The domestication of animals is often viewed as one of the most important developments in modern human history.  Although much attention has been paid to the effects of domestication on host phenotypes, the effects of domestication on the host gut microbiome is relatively understudied. Given the important role of the mammalian gut microbiome in host health, nutrition, and the immune system (McFall-Ngai et al. 2013), filling this knowledge gap has important potential health implications for livestock, pets, and for improving current management strategies. The diet of domesticated animals is often highly different and less varied than their ancestral diet (e.g. dogs eating Iams or Purina processed food vs. wolves eating caribou or bison). We propose to study equids as a model for investigating the effects of domestication in mammals.  We collected fecal samples from 45 individuals in the last wild population of the highly endangered Przewalski horse (Equus przewalskii) in Mongolia. The horse population was monitered with binoculars and fecal material was collected within an hour (usually within minutes) of defecation, allowing each fecal sample to be associated with a particular horse. Extremely detailed metadata is available for the population investigated, including pedigree, age, social structure, health, reintroduction dates, whole-genome data and years of daily behavioral observations in the field. We will compare the gut microbiota of these samples to fecal samples collected from 36 wild, domesticated horses living in the same region of Mongolia, which will allow us to isolate the effects of domestication/species differences from effects of current diet. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome of domesticated horses will have lower microbial diversity than the microbiome of their undomesticated relatives.

Composition of symbiotic bacteria as a predictor of survival in Panamanian golden frogs infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,"Symbiotic microbes can dramatically impact host health and fitness, and recent research in a diversity of systems suggests that different symbiont community structures may result in distinct outcomes for the host. In amphibians, some symbiotic skin bacteria produce metabolites that inhibit the growth of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous fungal pathogen that has caused many amphibian population declines and extinctions. Treatment with beneficial bacteria (probiotics) prevents Bd infection in some amphibian species, and provides optimism for conservation of species that are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by Bd. In a laboratory experiment, we used Bd-inhibitory bacteria from non Bd-susceptible Panamanian amphibians in a probiotic development trial with Panamanian golden frogs, Atelopus zeteki, a species currently surviving only in captive assurance colonies. Approximately 30% of infected golden frogs survived Bd exposure by either clearing infection or maintaining low Bd loads, but this was not associated with probiotic treatment. Survival was instead correlated with initial composition of the skin bacterial community and metabolites present on the skin. This suggests a strong link between the structure of these symbiotic microbial communities and amphibian host health in the face of Bd exposure.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",set()

Field study on drinking water samples from five utilities in eastern U.S.,"Building plumbing is a unique environment and serves as the frontline where most public exposure to drinking water microbes occur.  The building plumbing microbiome composition and the factors that shape it remains little understood.   In this study, standardized rigs were deployed at five potable water utilities (A-E) across the eastern U.S. and first-flush water samples were collected.  At each utility location one rig locates at the water treatment plant (WTP) and the other at the distribution system (DS), thus the impact of water age is examined.  Three pipe materials were compared: copper with lead solder (“copper”), CPVC with brass fittings (“CPVC” or “brass”) and copper/lead combined pipe (“copper/lead”).  All rigs were subject to a uniform stagnation-flush cycle.  Samples before and after stagnation are compared, and impact of different pipe materials is examined within after-stagnation samples.  First-flush water samples (~700mL) were collected at the end of stagnation period on three consecutive flow cycles/ days.  On-site water chemistry parameters and prior water chemistry monitoring data (over a 3-month period) was available.  High throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was employed to profile and compare the resident bulk water bacteria and archaea.

Most of the Dominant Members of Amphibian Skin Bacterial Communities Can Be Readily Cultured,"Currently, it is estimated that only 0.001% to 15% of bacteria in any given system can be cultured by use of commonly used techniques and media, yet culturing is critically important for investigations of bacterial function. Despite this situation, few studies
have attempted to link culture-dependent and culture-independent data for a single system to better understand which members of the microbial community are readily cultured. In amphibians, some cutaneous bacterial symbionts can inhibit establishment and growth of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and thus there is great interest in using these symbionts as
probiotics for the conservation of amphibians threatened by B. dendrobatidis. The present study examined the portion of the

Chronic Infection by Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa Associated with Dysregulation in T-Cell Immunity to Outer Membrane Porin F.,"Diseases that favor colonization of the respiratory tract with P. aeruginosa, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by an altered airway microbiome. Chronicity and virulence of P. aeruginosa respiratory tract infections is likely influenced by interactions with other lung microbiota or their products. The bacterial fermentation product 2,3-butanediol enhances virulence and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in vitro. This study assesses the effects of 2,3-butanediol on P. aeruginosa virulence in vivo and on microbiome in lung tissues. P. aeruginosa grown in the presence of 2,3-butanediol and encapsulated in agar beads persisted longer in the murine respiratory tract and resulted in increased colonization of the lung by environmental microbes such as Turicibacter, Clostridium and Parabaceroides. This suggests a role of fermentation products from the lung microbiota on P. aeruginosa virulence and aptitude to colonize the respiratory tract, resulting in dynamic shifts in microbiota diversity and disease susceptibility.

Conversion of L-lactate into n-caproate by a continuously fed reactor microbiome,"Conversion of lactate to n-caproate had been described for the type strain Megasphaera elsdenii in batch systems. Recently, investigators have also described production of n-caproate from endogenous or exogenous lactate with batch-fed reactor microbiomes. However, no reports exist of lactate to n-caproate conversion within a continuously fed bioreactor. Since continuously fed systems are advantageous for biotechnology production platforms, our objective was to develop such a system. Here, we demonstrated continuous lactate to n-caproate conversion for more than 165 days. The volumetric n-caproate production rate (productivity) was improved when we decreased the operating pH from 5.5 to 5.0, and was again improved when we utilized in-line product recovery via pertraction (membrane-based liquid-liquid extraction). We observed a maximum n-caproate productivity of 6.9 g COD/L-d for a period of 17 days at an L-lactate loading rate of 9.1 g COD/L-d, representing the highest sustained lactate to n-caproate conversion rate ever reported. We had to manage two competing lactate conversion pathways: 1) the reverse β-oxidation pathway to n-caproate; and 2) the acrylate pathway to propionate. We found that maintaining a low residual lactate concentration in the bioreactor broth was necessary to direct lactate conversion towards n-caproate instead of propionate. These findings provide a foundation for the development of new resource recovery processes to produce higher-value liquid products (e.g., n-caproate) from carbon-rich wastewaters containing lactate or lactate precursors (e.g., carbohydrates).",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioengineering', 'Environmental sciences', 'Metabolomics'}",set()

Baleen whales host a unique gut microbiome with similarities to both carnivores and herbivores,"Mammals host gut microbiomes of immense physiological consequence, but the determinants of diversity in these communities remain poorly understood. Diet appears to be the dominant factor, but host phylogeny also seems to be an important, if unpredictable, correlate. Here we show that baleen whales, which prey on animals (fish and crustaceans), harbor unique gut microbiomes with surprising parallels in functional capacity and higher level taxonomy to those of terrestrial herbivores. These similarities likely reflect a shared role for fermentative metabolisms despite a shift in primary carbon sources from plant-derived to animal-derived polysaccharides, such as chitin. In contrast, protein catabolism and essential amino acid synthesis pathways in baleen whale microbiomes more closely resemble those of terrestrial carnivores. Our results demonstrate that functional attributes of the microbiome can vary independently even given an animal-derived diet, illustrating how diet and evolutionary history combine to shape microbial diversity in the mammalian gut. Future work is required to verify these results in other cetacean species.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Biotechnology', 'Animal study', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Development of the chick microbiome: How early exposure influences future microbial diversity,"The concept of improving animal health through improved gut health has existed in food animal production for decades; however, only recently have tools been developed that allow us to identify those microbes in the intestine associated with improved performance.  Currently, little is known about how the avian microbiome develops or the factors that affect its composition.  To begin to address this knowledge gap, the present study assessed the development of the cecal microbiome in chicks from hatch to 28 days of age with and without a live Salmonella vaccine and/or probiotic supplement; both are products intended to promote gut health. The microbiome of growing chicks develops rapidly from days 1-3, and the microbiome is primarily Enterobacteriaceae, but Firmicutes increase in abundance and taxonomic diversity starting around day 7.  As the microbiome continues to develop, the influence of the treatments becomes stronger. Predicted metagenomic content suggests that functionally, treatment may stimulate more differences at day 14, despite the strong taxonomic differences at day 28.  These results demonstrate that these live microbial treatments do impact the development of the bacterial taxa found in the growing chicks; however, additional experiments are needed to understand the biochemical and functional consequences of these alterations.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Agricultural science'}",{''}
Impact of freeze-drying on milk oligosaccharide content and marker gene bacterial community profiles in infant fecal samples,"Infant fecal samples are commonly studied to investigate the impacts of breastfeeding on the development of the microbiota and subsequent health effects. Comparisons of infants living in different geographic regions and environmental contexts are needed to aid our understanding of evolutionarily-selected milk adaptations. However, the preservation of fecal samples from individuals in remote locales until they can be processed can be a challenge. Freeze-drying (lyophilization) offers a cost-effective way to preserve some biological samples for transport and analysis at a later date. Currently, it is unknown what, if any, biases are introduced into various analyses by the freeze-drying process. Here, we investigated how freeze-drying affected analysis of two relevant aspects of infant fecal samples, marker gene amplicon sequencing of the bacterial community and the fecal oligosaccharide profile (undigested human milk oligosaccharides). No differences were discovered between the fecal oligosaccharide profiles of wet and freeze-dried samples. The marker gene sequencing data showed an increase in proportional representation of Bacteriodes and a decrease in detection of bifidobacteria and members of class Bacilli after freeze-drying. This systematic bias may possibly be related to the cell morphology of these different taxa (Gram status). However, these effects did not overwhelm the natural variation among individuals, as the community data still strongly grouped by subject and not by freeze-drying status. We also found that compensating for sample concentration during freeze-drying, while not necessary, was also not detrimental. Freeze-drying may therefore be an acceptable method of sample preservation and mass reduction for some studies of microbial ecology and milk glycan analysis.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Metabolomics'}",set()

Growth and Morbidity of Gambian Infants are Influenced by Maternal Milk Oligosaccharides and Infant Gut Microbiota,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) play an important role in the health of an infant as substrate for beneficial gut bacteria. Little is known about the effects of HMO composition and its changes on the morbidity and growth outcomes of infants living in areas with high infection rates. Mother’s HMO composition and infant gut microbiota from 33 Gambian mother/infant pairs at 4, 16, and 20 weeks postpartum were analyzed for relationships between HMOs, microbiota, and infant morbidity and growth. The data indicate that lacto-N-fucopentaose I was associated with decreased infant morbidity, and 3’-sialyllactose was found to be a good indicator of infant weight-for-age . Because HMOs, gut microbiota, and infant health are interrelated, the relationship between infant health and their microbiome were analyzed. While bifidobacteria were the dominant genus in the infant gut overall, Dialister and Prevotella were negatively correlated with morbidity, and Bacteroides was increased in infants with abnormal calprotectin. Mothers nursing in the wet season (July to October) produced significantly less oligosaccharides compared to those nursing in the dry season (November to June).

Pyrosequencing-Based Assessment of Soil pH as a Predictor of Soil Bacterial Community Structure at the Continental Scale,"Soils harbor enormously diverse bacterial populations, and soil bacterial communities can vary greatly in composition across space. However, our understanding of the specific changes in soil bacterial community structure that occur across larger spatial scales is limited because most previous work has focused on either surveying a relatively small number of soils in detail or analyzing a larger number of soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Here we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique to characterize bacterial communities in 88 soils from across North and South America, obtaining an average of 1,501 sequences per soil. We found that overall bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise UniFrac distances, was significantly correlated with differences in soil pH (r = 0.79), largely driven by changes in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes across the range of soil pHs. In addition, soil pH explains a significant portion of the variability associated with observed changes in the phylogenetic structure within each dominant lineage. The overall phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities was also correlated with soil pH (R2 = 0.50), with peak diversity in soils with near-neutral pHs. Together, these results suggest that the structure of soil bacterial communities is predictable, to some degree, across larger spatial scales, and the effect of soil pH on bacterial community composition is evident at even relatively coarse levels of taxonomic resolution.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Zoology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

The Fecal Microbial Community of Breast-fed Infants from Georgia and Armenia ,"Oligosaccharides from breast milk are believed to help shape the infant intestinal microbiota through their ability to feed specific bacterial groups, in particular Bifidobacterium. In a subset of mothers the fucosyltransferase 2 (“secretor”) gene is mutationally inactivated, which leads to milk lacking 2’ fucosylated glycans and was previously shown to impact microbial colonization of the neonate gut. Similarly, infants may receive distinct individual bacterial exposures which influence their gut communities over time. Here we study the infant gut microbiota through a longitudinal study on cohorts of breast-fed infants from the neighboring countries of Armenia and Georgia. Marker gene sequencing of 16S ribosomal genes revealed that the gut microbial communities of infants from these countries were dominated by bifidobacteria, were different from each other, and were marginally influenced by their mother’s secretor status. Species-level differences in the bifidobacterial communities of each country and birth method were also observed. These community differences suggest that environmental variation between individuals in different locations may influence the gut microbiota of infants, possibly through selection or seeding differences.

Ecological succession reveals signatures of marineterrestrial transition in salt marsh fungal communities,"Marine-terrestrial colonization represents one of the most seminal transition in microbial ecology and evolution. Understanding the distribution and drivers of soil microbial communities in transient nascent ecosystems is critical giving the role of microbes in soil biogeochemistry and their multifaceted influence on ecosystem succession. Here we studied a well-established salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development and provide high-resolution patterns of fungal community composition, diversity and ecological succession through soil formation. Noteworthy, despite presenting 10- to 100-fold lowered fungal abundances, initial soil sites held comparable richness as observed for more mature soils. These initial sites also exhibited significant temporal variations in β-diversity, which may be attributed to the great dynamics imposed by the tides. The fungal community compositions changed substantially along the succession, revealing a clear signature of ecological replacement by gradually decoupling the marine environment towards a terrestrial system. Fungal taxonomic distributions were further interpreted in the context of their ecophysiology and potential role in the ecosystem. Moreover, distance-based linear modelling revealed soil physical structure and organic matter to be the best predictors of the shifts in fungal β-diversity along the chronosequence. Taken together, our study lays a basis of understanding of the spatiotemporally-determined fungal community dynamics in salt marsh soils and highlights their ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Phylogenetic and ecological factors impact the gut microbiota of two Neotropical primate species,"Recent studies suggest that variation in diet across time and space results in changes in the mammalian gut microbiota. This variation may ultimately impact host ecology by altering nutritional status and health. Wild animal populations provide an excellent opportunity for understanding these interactions. However, compared to clinical studies, microbial research targeting wild animals is currently limited, and many published studies focus only on a single population of a single host species. In this study we utilize fecal samples from two species of howler monkey (Aloutta pigra and A. palliata) collected at four sites to investigate factors influencing the gut microbiota at three scales: taxonomic (host species), ecosystemic (forest type), and local (habitat disturbance/season). The results demonstrate that the effect of host species on the gut microbiota is stronger than the effect of host forest type, which is stronger than the effect of habitat disturbance or seasonality. Nevertheless, within host species, gut microbiota composition differs in response to forest type, habitat disturbance, and season. Variations in the effect size of these factors are associated both with host species and environment. This information may be beneficial for understanding ecological and evolutionary questions associated with Mesoamerican howler monkeys, as well as determining conservation challenges facing each species. These mechanisms may also provide insight into the ecology of other species of howler monkeys, non-human primates, and mammals. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Zoology', 'Ecology', 'Biology'}",set()

Ankylosing Spondylitis Rats," The HLA-B27 gene is a major risk factor for clinical diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, acute anterior uveitis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, but its mechanism of risk enhancement is not completely understood. The gut microbiome has recently been shown to influence several HLA-linked diseases. However, the role of HLA-B27 in shaping the gut microbiome has not been previously investigated. In this study, we characterize the differences in the gut microbiota mediated by the presence of the HLA-B27 gene. We identified differences in the cecal microbiota of Lewis rats transgenic for HLA-B27 and human β2-microglobulin (hβ2m), compared with wild-type Lewis rats, using biome representational in situ karyotyping (BRISK) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S sequencing revealed significant differences between transgenic animals and wild type animals by principal coordinates analysis. Further analysis of the data set revealed an increase in Prevotella spp. and a decrease in Rikenellaceae relative abundance in the transgenic animals compared to the wild type animals. By BRISK analysis, species-specific differences included an increase in Bacteroides vulgatus abundance in HLA-B27/hβ2m and hβ2m compared to wild type rats.

Distinct microbial communities associated with buried soils in the Siberian tundra.,"Around 1700 Gt carbon are stored in the Northern latitude permafrost regions (Schuur et al, BioScience 2008). This is more than double the size of the atmospheric carbon pool but the estimates are still quite uncertain and might be even higher. It is however estimated that 25 percent of this large carbon pool in Arctic soils will be lost by the end of the 21st century and will be released to the atmosphere as CO2 (Gruber et al., 2004). The subduction of organic-rich material from the surface to deeper layers caused by repeated freezing and thawing of the active layer during Arctic summer is assumed to be a major mechanism of carbon storage in the Arctic. These cryoturbations are spatially widely distributed and store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Decomposition of recent cryoturbated carbon is strongly retarded thereby essentially taking out this fraction of SOC from the current carbon cycle. Todays primary concern and research focus is the vulnerability of cryoturbated SOC due to global warming which is predicted to lead to intensified decomposition and elevated greenhouse gas emissions. Here we present a study that aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the microbial community structure of permafrost-affected and cryoturbated soils of different Northern latitude permafrost regions in Siberia and Greenland. For this purpose, soil samples were collected in northeast Siberia in a transect along the upper Kolyma river, and in the Zackenberg region, Greenland. The sampling scheme covered several bioclimatic subzones and vegetation types. We are currently analysing data retrieved from SSU amplicon sequencing, the quantification of several functional groups involved in carbon cycling and physico-chemical analyses in order to predict potential microbial regulators in SOC storage.

We partnered with the Cheyenne & Arapaho (C&A), federally recognized American Indian Tribes in Oklahoma, and compared gut microbiome diversity and metabolic function of C&A participants to individuals of non-native ancestry in Oklahoma (NNI). While the C&A and NNI
participants share microbiome features common to industrialized populations, the C&A participants had taxonomic profiles characterized by a reduced abundance of the antiinflammatory bacterial genus Faecalibacterium, along with a fecal metabolite profile similar to dysbiotic states described for metabolic disorders. American Indians are known to be at elevated risk for metabolic disorders. While many aspects of this health disparity remain poorly understood, our results support the need to further study the microbiome as a contributing factor. As the field of microbiome research transitions to therapeutic interventions, it raises concerns that the continued exclusion and lack of participation of American Indian communities in these studies will further exacerbate health disparities. To increase momentum in fostering these much needed partnerships, it is essential that the scientific community actively engage in and recruit these vulnerable populations in basic research through a strategy that promotes mutual trust and understanding, as outlined in this study.ERP015180",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Medicine'}",set()
Gut bacteria of Peruvian rainforest ants,"Ants make up a substantial fraction of Earth’s animal biomass, particularly in tropical forests, where they may account for a plurality of animal biomass in the canopy. But how does an ancestrally omnivorous lineage become dominant in a nitrogen- and amino-acid-limited environment? While anecdotal evidence exist suggesting that bacteria, which have facilitated dietary flexibility in so many other insects, may have played an important role in the evolution of functional herbivory in ants, to date there has been no systematic investigation of the diversity and abundance of potentially symbiotic bacteria in ants. Currently, for this evolutionarily diverse and ecologically dominant insect family, we don’t understand what constitutes a “typical” gut microbiome. 

The proposed project seeks to begin answering this question, starting with a diverse set of carefully collected specimens from the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. The collection site hosts one of the most diverse assemblages of ant species in the world, and specimens from this region formed the basis for the landmark stable isotope study by Davidson et al. indicating the dietary breadth of tropical ants. Thus, samples from this region represent an ideal first case study that addresses a specific unanswered ecological question, while simultaneously generating data covering a broad swath of the total ant phylogeny. 

To facilitate these goals, we have collected an initial sample set consisting of many individuals from over 100 ant species in the Madre de Dios region of Peru. For each colony collected, some specimens have been preserved whole, and some dissected according to previously-established protocols for separate preservation of the GI tract; this has proven important to bias analyses towards gut-relevant microbes and reduce the impact of surface contaminants. For most collections, dissected guts have been preserved both for molecular analysis and fixed for FISH microscopy / morphometric analysis. Additionally, a gut from most of the collected colonies was observed in the field using fluorescence microscopy, yielding a preliminary visual index of the morphology, distribution, and abundance of microbial cells present.

To understand the probiotic or prebiotic effects of fertilizing freshwater ponds with livestock manure, we grew tilapia and catfish together for four weeks under seven manure treatments including layer chicken, broiler chicken, guinea fowl, quail, pig, cow, and standard commercial feed only and evaluated the microbial communities of the manure, water column, tilapia and catfish feces using 16S and 18S rRNA marker genes along with whole genome sequencing.

Tilapia growth was highest in the broiler manure but not significant while tilapia fecal microbial richness (but not catfish) was positively correlated with microbial activity (P=0.0309, R2=0.2458). Animal manure was unique and influenced the bacterial microbiome in pond water, tilapia gut, and catfish gut and eukaryotic microbiome in pond water and catfish guts (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001). On average, 18.5%, 18.6%, and 45.3% of manure bacteria sOTUs were present in the water column, catfish feces, and tilapia feces which comprised 3.7%, 12.8%, and 10.9% of the total microbial richness of the communities, respectively. Antibiotic resistance genes were highest in the manure and water samples followed by tilapia feces and then lowest in catfish feces (P<0.0001). In this study we demonstrate how the bacterial and eukaryotic microbial composition of fish ponds are influenced by livestock specific manure inputs and that the gut microbiome of O. shiranus is more sensitive and responsive than C. gariepinus to these changes. Since only 13 % of the core manure bacteria could be detected in the core pond water and fish gut communities we conclude that animal manure used as fertilizer induces a primarily prebiotic effect on the pond ecosystem rather than a direct probiotic effect on fish. We identify how the tilapia gut microbiome is more influenced by environmental microbes while African catfish growth benefits more from manure fertilization.

"Multi-omics of permafrost, active layer and thermokarst bog soil microbiomes","Over 20% of Earth's terrestrial surface is underlain by permafrost with vast stores of carbon that, once thawed, may represent the largest future transfer of carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere. This process is largely dependent on microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganisms in some permafrost soils and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments. However, the fate of permafrost carbon depends on climatic, hydrological and microbial responses to thaw at decadal scales. Here we use the combination of several molecular 'omics' approaches to determine the phylogenetic composition of the microbial communities, including several draft genomes of novel species, their functional potential and activity in soils representing different states of thaw: intact permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer and thermokarst bog. The multi-omics strategy reveals a good correlation of process rates to omics data for dominant processes, such as methanogenesis in the bog, as well as novel survival strategies for potentially active microbes in permafrost.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Arid Soil Microbiome: Significant Impacts of Increasing Aridity,"Global deserts occupy one third of the Earth’s surface and contribute significantly to organic carbon storage, a process at risk in dryland ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to climate-driven ecosystem degradation. Forces controlling desert-ecosystem degradation rates are poorly understood, particularly in the relevance of the arid-soil microbiome. Here we document correlations between increasing aridity and soil bacterial and archaeal microbiome-composition along arid to hyperarid transects traversing the Atacama Desert, Chile. A meta-analysis reveals that Atacama soil microbiomes exhibit a gradient in composition, are distinct from a broad cross-section of non-desert soils, yet similar to three deserts from different continents. Community richness and diversity were significantly positively correlated with soil relative humidity (SoilRH). Phylogenetic composition was strongly correlated with SoilRH, temperature and electrical conductivity. The strongest and most significant correlations between SoilRH and phylum relative abundance were observed for Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Euryarchaeota (rs>0.81; q≤0.005); characterized by 10- to 300-fold decreases in relative abundance of each taxon. In addition, network analysis revealed a deterioration in the density of significant associations between taxa along the arid to hyperarid gradient, a pattern that may compromise the resilience of hyperarid communities because they lack properties associated with more integrated communities. In summary, results suggest that arid-soil microbiome stability is sensitive to aridity as demonstrated by decreased community connectivity associated with the transition from the arid to hyperarid aridity classes and the significant correlations observed between soilRH and both diversity and the relative abundance of key microbial phyla typically dominant in global soils.

"Investigating the rhizosphere microbiome as influenced by soil selenium, plant species, plant selenium accumulation and geographic proximity","Selenium is an essential trace element at low levels but toxic at elevated levels. Some areas in Colorado have seleniferous soil, others have low-selenium soil. The seleniferous soil has special vegetation containing selenium hyperaccumulator species Stanleya pinnata (Brassicaceae), Astragalus bisulcatus (Fabaceae) and Symphyotrichum ericoides (Asteraceae), which accumulate 0.1 to 1.5% of their dry weight in selenium. Our studies over the past decade indicate that these hyperaccumulator plants profoundly affect their local ecosystem by redistributing selenium and converting it from inorganic to organic forms. The rhizosphere soil of hyperaccumulator plants contained 6-14 fold higher selenium levels than bulk soil (for a review see El Mehdawi and Pilon-Smits, 2012). We are currently focusing on plant-microbe relationships in seleniferous areas. We have already found that selenium hyperaccumulator litter is decomposed fast in seleniferous areas, presumably by specialized selenium-resistant microbes and detrivores (Quinn et al. 2011). Indeed, we found higher levels of culturable microbes in selenium-rich litter than in low-selenium litter. We have also found evidence that endophytes in hyperaccumulators may affect the plant’s selenium metabolism (Valdez Barillas et al. 2012; Lindblom et al. 2013). Up to 30% elemental selenium was found in some hyperaccumulators in the field but not in other individuals from the same species, nor in greenhouse grown plants. The elemental selenium was found in root nodules, roots, stems and seeds. Our objective for the coming years is to investigate which microbes live in association with selenium hyperaccumulators, and how their microbiome compares with related non-hyperaccumulators in seleniferous and non-seleniferous areas. We also want to explore how microbial composition relates to plant selenium concentration within a hyperaccumulator population. In preliminary studies (unpublished) we could cultivate over 70 different bacterial isolated from surface-sterilized roots, stems and leaves of Stanleya pinnata and Astragalus bisulcatus. The many different genera of hyperaccumulator endophytes had in common extreme selenium tolerance (often >200 mM), much higher than control bacteria from non-seleniferous environments. They also showed ability to convert toxic forms of selenium to elemental selenium. While only 1% of bacteria are culturable, these are promising data for further studies into the full microbiome of hyperaccumulators.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Plant biology', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Obligate biotroph pathogens defend their niche against competing microbes by keeping host defense at a functional level,"Recent research has given insights into how plants behave under single and combined abiotic and biotic stress conditions in a controlled environment, highlighting the challenges and need for experiments under natural conditions where plants have to adapt to a variety of environmental stresses during their growth period. In nature, a broad diversity of microbes colonizes the phyllosphere and rhizosphere causing biotic stress. One of the most common diseases on wild Brassicaceae, like Arabidopsis thaliana, is the obligate biotroph oomycete genus Albugo, causal agent of white rust. Biotrophic, as well as hemibiotrophic plant pathogens interact efficiently with the host plant and suppress host defense responses. Lab experiments have even shown that Albugo sp. are able to suppress non-host resistance and therefore enable pathogens to grow that are otherwise avirulent. We asked how a pathogen that is vitally dependent on a living host can compete in nature for limited niche space while paradoxically enabling colonization of its host plant for competitors. To address this question, we used a proteomics approach to identify differences and commonalities between lab and field samples of Albugo sp.-infected and -uninfected Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We could identify highly similar protein profiles in infected and uninfected plants. In wild plants, however, a broad range of defense related proteins were detected in the apoplast regardless of infection status, while no, or low levels of defense-related proteins were detected in lab samples. These results indicate that Albugo sp. do not trigger strong immune responses and leave distinct branches of the immune signaling network intact. To validate our findings, and to get mechanistic insights, immune-induced and -compromised A. thaliana plants were tested with different biotrophic pathogens. Our findings reveal how the biotroph pathogen Albugo selectively interferes with host defense under different environmental conditions and competitive pressure to maintain its ecological niche. Adaptation to host immune responses and maintaining a partially active host immunity seems advantageous against competitors. We suggest a model for future research that considers not only host-microbe but in addition microbe-microbe and microbe-host-environment factors.

Exposure to toxic metals triggers unique responses from the rat gut microbiota,"Our understanding of the interaction between the gut microbiota and host health has steadily increased in recent years. However, the effects of toxic metal exposure on the gut microbiota remain poorly characterized. As this microbiota creates a critical interface between the external environment and the host’s cells, it represents a potential target for signatures of exposure. To clarify the interactions between the microbiota and metal exposure, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing to track changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in rats exposed to heavy metals. Rats were exposed daily, for five days by oral gavage to sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, cobalt chloride, sodium dichromate, nickel chloride or a vehicle control. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was then sequenced from fecal samples collected before and after the exposure regime. Significant changes in microbial composition were observed in each of the high-dose metal exposures, and dose-dependent effects were observed in response to arsenic, cadmium and nickel. Many of these perturbations were not uniform across all metals. For example, prevalence of the phylum Verrucomicrobia increased in response to cadmium, cobalt and chromium exposures, but decreased after nickel exposure.  Ultimately, metal exposure altered the gut microbiota composition in rats, and the taxa affected were highly metal specific. However, functional analysis indicated that strains with greater iron-importing repertoires increased after exposure to arsenic and nickel, suggesting some possibility of a shared response. These findings support the utility of the microbiota as a pre-clinical tool for identifying exposures to heavy metals.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Toxicology'}",set()

Rio de Janeiro Coastline,"Although Brazil is well known for the great biodiversity within its flora and fauna, the microbial diversity has been poorly characterized.

All together make the surrounding areas of Rio de Janeiro coastline a microbial diversity hotspot. These tropical regions are of enormous interest since they are considered an important source of novel and unique microorganisms for bioremediation and for biotechnological industries. However, the adjacent areas present either a deficient sewage treatment or/and a busy industrial park that can severely impact the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the microbial community and the functional diversity from pristine and contaminated aquatic environments from Rio de Janeiro coastline.

Effects of preservation and storage conditions on the fecal microbiome,"Microbiome studies using fecal samples have allowed us to discover a lot about human health, animal evolution, and basic host-microbe interactions.

One widely used method is freezing at -20C or -80C. However, in scenarios were freezing is not a viable option, an alternative preservation method must used, but the effectiveness of commonly used preservatives is not well understood. To better understand the effects of different storage preservatives and storage conditions on the microbial community of fecal samples, we exposed human and canine fecal samples to a variety of commonly used preservation methods including freezing, using ethanol, RNALater, Omni-gene gut, and FTA cards, and a range of temperature conditions.

Soil bacterial diversity in the Arctic is not fundamentally different from that found in other biomes,"The severe environmental stresses of the Arctic may have promoted unique soil bacterial communities compared to those found in lower latitude environments. Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis of the biogeography of soil bacterial communities in the Arctic using a high resolution bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. We also compared bacterial communities within arctic soils to soils from a wide range of more temperate biomes to predict variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe. We show that arctic soil bacterial community composition and diversity are structured according to local variation in soil pH rather than geographical proximity to neighboring sites, suggesting that local environmental heterogeneity is far more important than dispersal limitation in determining community-level differences. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied as much within arctic soils as across soils from a wide range of lower latitude biomes, and diversity levels were also similar, indicating global similarities in the structure of soil bacterial communities. These results contrast with the well-established latitudinal gradients in animal and plant diversity, suggesting that the controls on bacterial community distributions are fundamentally different from those observed for macro-organisms and that our biome definitions are not useful for predicting variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Biotechnology', 'Microbiology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Quantifying and understanding well-to-well contamination in microbiome research,"Microbial sequences inferred as belonging to one sample may not have originated from that sample. Such contamination may arise from laboratory or reagent sources or from physical exchange between samples. This study seeks to rigorously assess the behavior of this often-neglected between-sample contamination. Using a set of different bacteria each assigned a particular well in a plate, we assess the frequency at which sequences from each source appears in other wells. We evaluate the effects of different DNA extraction methods performed in two labs using a consistent plate layout including blanks, low biomass samples, and high biomass samples. Well-to-well contamination occured primarily during DNA extraction and to a lesser extent during library preparation, while barcode leakage was negligible. Processing sites differed in the levels of contamination. DNA extraction methods differed in their occurrences and levels of well-to-well contamination, with robotic methods having more well-to-well contamination while manual methods having higher background contaminants. Well-to-well contamination was observed to occur primarily in neighboring samples, but with rare events occurring up to 10 wells apart. The effect of well-to-well was greatest in samples with lower biomass, and negatively impacted metrics of alpha and beta diversity. Our work emphasizes that sample contamination is a combination of crosstalk from nearby wells and background contaminants. Microbiome research studies should account for and evaluate well-to-well contamination in study design and be extremely careful about removing taxa or OTUs appearing in negative controls, as many will be microbes from other samples rather than reagent contaminants. To reduce well-to-well effects, samples should be randomized across plates, and samples of similar biomass processed together. These effects should be considered in the development of new assays including extraction methods, and special care should be taken when analyzing behavior of low frequency OTUs that are highly abundant in other samples in the same experiment. Clinical microbiome assays need to account for the impact of well-to-well contamination on alpha and beta diversity metrics.

IL-4R Blockade by Dupilumab Decreases Staphylococcus aureus Colonization and Increases Microbial Diversity in Atopic Dermatitis,"Dupilumab is a fully human antibody to interleukin-4 receptor alpha that improves the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. To determine the effects of dupilumab on Staphylococcus aureus colonization and microbial diversity on the skin, bacterial DNA was analyzed from swabs collected from lesional and nonlesional skin in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 54 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis randomized (1:1) and treated with either dupilumab (200 mg weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. Microbial diversity and relative abundance of Staphylococcus were assessed by DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA, and absolute S. aureus abundance was measured by quantitative PCR. Before treatment, lesional skin had lower microbial diversity and higher overall abundance of S. aureus than nonlesional skin. During dupilumab treatment, microbial diversity increased and the abundance of S. aureus decreased. Pronounced changes were seen in nonlesional and lesional skin. Decreased S. aureus abundance during dupilumab treatment correlated with clinical improvement of atopic dermatitis and biomarkers of type 2 immunity. We conclude that clinical improvement of atopic dermatitis that is mediated by interleukin-4 receptor alpha inhibition and the subsequent suppression of type 2 inflammation is correlated with increased microbial diversity and reduced abundance of S. aureus.

"Host age, social group and habitat type influence the gut microbiota of wild, ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)","The gut microbiota contributes to host health by maintaining homeostasis, increasing digestive efficiency, and facilitating the development of the immune system. The composition of the gut microbiota can change dramatically within and between individuals of a species as a result of diet, age, or habitat. Therefore, understanding the factors determining gut microbiota diversity and composition can contribute to our knowledge of host ecology as well as to conservation efforts. Here we use high-throughput sequencing to describe variation in the gut microbiota of the endangered ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) at the Bezà Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR) in southwestern Madagascar. Specifically, we measured the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in relation to social group, age, sex, tooth wear and loss, and habitat disturbance. The results indicate that the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was influenced by social group, age, and habitat disturbance. However, no significant variation in the diversity of ring-tailed lemur gut microbiota in response to any variable tested. Because few individual microbial taxa were responsible for the observed patterns and effect sizes were small, particularly for habitat disturbance, it appears that these factors may not impact the lemur gut microbiota as strongly as they impact the gut microbiota of other primate species.

The purpose of this research is to identify the role of gut microbiome and metabolome in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in sleep apnea patients. Sleep apnea has been associated with higher incidence of atherosclerosis (Lui and Sau-Man, 2012). Starting with preliminary experiments in LDLR mice, if we are able to identify bacterial and/or metabolite factors that drive the development of this condition under simulated sleep apnea conditions, we may be able to extend this study to a larger cohort of mice and ultimately to human cohorts. This is an unexplored domain in atherosclerosis research and has a potential to lead to novel approaches of intervention. There is evidence to suggest that transient bacteremia and/or leakage of bacterial products into the blood stream in people with severe periodontal disease exacerbates the development of atherosclerosis (Koren, et al. 2011) lending support to our hypothesis that disturbance of the gut microbiome may have a similar effect.

Geography and location are the primary drivers of office microbiome composition,"In the United States, humans spend the majority of their time indoors where they are exposed to the microbiome of the built environment (BE) they inhabit. Despite the ubiquity of microbes in BEs, and their potential impacts on health and building materials, basic questions about the microbiology of these environments remain unanswered. We present a study on the impacts of geography, material type, human interaction, location in a room, seasonal variation, and indoor and microenvironmental parameters on bacterial communities in offices. Our data elucidates several important features of microbial communities in BEs. First, under normal office environmental conditions, bacterial communities do not differ based on surface material (e.g., ceiling tile or carpet), but do differ based on the location in a room (e.g., ceiling or floor), two features which are often conflated, but which we are able to separate here. We suspect that previous work showing differences in bacterial composition with surface material were likely detecting differences based on different usage patterns. Next, we find that offices have city-specific bacterial communities, such that we can accurately predict which city an office microbiome sample is derived from, but office-specific bacterial communities are less apparent. This differs from previous work which has suggested office-specific compositions of bacterial communities. We again suspect that the difference from prior work arises from different usage patterns.

Effect of anaerobic soil disinfestation on soilborne phytopathogenic agents and bacterial community under walnut tree-crop nursery conditions,"Anaerobic Soil Disinfestation (ASD) is a chemical-independent approach to manage soilborne phytopathogens. While it has been demonstrated that ASD can suppress phytopathogens in vegetable cropping systems, it has not been examined for control of tree-crop diseases. We examined the potential of ASD to manage soilborne populations of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pythium ultimum under walnut nursery conditions and compared the efficacy of ASD with the chemical fumigant Telone-C35. Mesh bags of sterile field soil inoculated with either A. tumefaciens or P. ultimum were buried in the first of two trials at 7.6 and 15.2 cm soil depths and in the second trial at 15.2, 45.7, and 76.2 cm soil depths prior to ASD or fumigation treatments. After one week of ASD, populations of both phytopathogens fell below detection limits at 7.6 and 15.2 cm soil depths. After completion of the six-week ASD treatment or 4-week post-fumigation, populations of A. tumefaciens remained below detection limits at 7.6 and 15.2 cm depths, were significant reduced compared to no-treatment control soils, and and were not significantly different from populations in the fumigation treatment. A. tumefaciens populations were also significantly reduced compared to no-treatment control soils in both ASD and fumigation treatments at the 45.7 and 76.2 cm depths. Pythium ultimum populations dipped below detection limits after ASD treatment at 7.6 and 15.2 cm soil depths, and were significantly lower than no-treatment controls at the 45.7 cm depth. The bacterial community composition of ASD-treated soils also was significantly different as a function of soil depth. In addition, the effect of ASD on the bacterial community composition persisted with time, as evidenced by the fact that the bacterial composition remained significantly different compared to the no-treatment controls 4 months after ASD treatment. The documented ASD-induced changes in the soilborne bacterial communities may have contributed to the population reductions observed for both A. tuemfaciens and P. ultimum.

Free-Living Amoeba Reservoirs of Pathogenic Leptospira,"The lifecycle of pathogenic Leptospira includes chronic renal colonization of mammalian reservoir hosts, which urinate the organism into the environment where they persist and are later transmitted to humans. Remarkably little is known regarding mechanisms by which pathogenic Leptospira survive in soil and surface water. While it has been assumed that Leptospira live free in the environment, we postulate that Leptospira interact with predatory protozoa, specifically free-living amoeba (FLA), to prolong survival, maintain virulence and select for host adaptation. Understanding mechanisms by which Leptospira survive in diverse ecological/environmental settings has the potential to yield novel approaches to interrupt transmission to humans. We will apply 16S and 18S metagenomic analysis of environmental samples to identify both expected and unanticipated Leptospira-FLA associations.


Leptospirosis is the most epidemic-prone, water-transmitted disease worldwide, with over a million new cases annually, mostly occurring among impoverished communities in developing countries. Driven in large part by climate change and urban population growth, the disease has spread to new areas, and flood-associated urban epidemics have escalated. Symptoms vary from a mild self-resolving ""flu-like"" illness to multiorgan failure and death. Nevertheless, key gaps in our understanding of disease pathogenesis hinder effective clinical management. As a result, case fatality, even among patients in ICU receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, remains significant worldwide (often approaching 70% in some settings). Newer therapies, e.g., plasma exchange with or without the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs, seem promising, but are expensive and impractical in resource-constrained countries.

Effect of oxalate on gut microbiota of N. albigula,"Diet is one of the primary drivers that sculpts the form and function of the mammalian gut microbiota. However, the enormous

The objective of the current study was to elucidate interactions between the gut microbiota of the mammalian herbivore Neotoma
albigula and dietary oxalate, a plant secondary compound (PSC) degraded exclusively by the gut microbiota. We quantified
oxalate degradation in N. albigula fed increasing amounts of oxalate over time and tracked the response of the fecal microbiota
using high-throughput sequencing. The amount of oxalate degraded in vivo was linearly correlated with the amount of oxalate consumed.
The addition of dietary oxalate was found to impact microbial species diversity by increasing the representation of certain taxa,
some of which are known to be capable of degrading oxalate (e.g., Oxalobacter spp.). Furthermore, the relative abundances of 117 operational
taxonomic units (OTU) exhibited a significant correlation with oxalate consumption. The results of this study indicate that
dietary oxalate induces complex interactions within the gut microbiota that include an increase in the relative abundance of a community

Comparison of oral collection methods for studies of microbiota - Mayo,"Background: A number of cohort studies have collected Scope mouthwash samples by mail which are being used for microbiota measurements. We evaluated the stability of Scope mouthwash samples at ambient temperature and determined the comparability of Scope mouthwash with saliva collection using the OMNIgene ORAL kit.
Methods: Fifty-three healthy volunteers from Mayo Clinic and fifty cohort members from Bangladesh provided oral samples. One aliquot of the OMNIgene ORAL and Scope mouthwash were frozen immediately and one aliquot of the Scope mouthwash remained at ambient temperature for four days and then was frozen. DNA was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced using the HiSeq. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated.
Results: The overall stability of the Scope mouthwash samples was relatively high for alpha and beta diversity. For example, the meta-analyzed ICC for the Shannon Index was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.96). Similarly, the ICCs for the relative abundance of the top 25 genera were generally high. The comparability of the two sample types was relatively low when measured using ICCs, but were increased by using a Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) to compare the rank order of individuals.
Conclusions: Overall, the Scope mouthwash samples appear to be stable at ambient temperature which suggests that oral rinse samples received by the mail can be used for microbial analyses.

"Antibiotic perturbation of the murine gut microbiome enhances the adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver disease associated with high-fat diet.","Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are serious health concerns, especially in Western populations. Antibiotic exposure and high-fat diet (HFD) are important and modifiable factors that may contribute to these diseases. To investigate the relationship of antibiotic exposure with microbiome perturbations in a murine model of growth promotion, C57BL/6 mice received lifelong sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT), or not (control). In this model, which included HFD, STAT mice developed increased weight and fat mass compared to controls. Although results in males and females were not identical, insulin resistance and NAFLD were more severe in the STAT mice. To characterize microbiota changes caused by STAT, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was examined from collected fecal samples and analyzed. Fecal microbiota from STAT mice were distinct from controls. Compared with controls, STAT exposure led to early conserved diet-independent microbiota changes indicative of an immature microbial community. Key taxa were identified as STAT-specific and several were found to be predictive of disease. Inferred network models showed topological shifts concurrent with growth promotion and suggest the presence of keystone species.

Taxonomic diversity and succession of estuarine plankton communities,"The aim of our project is to describe the bacterial community diversity of two Basque estuaries:, Bilbao estuary, a metropolitan and industrial zone, which is surrounded by this large city (~1 million habitants), while the other one, Urdaibai estuary, is a UNESCO biosphere reserve located in a relatively pristine environment. On the one hand, Bilbao estuary was previously (70s-80s) considered one of the most polluted estuaries in Europe, however, a new water sewage treatment (since late 90s) and the considerable reduction of the industrial activity in the area have significantly decreased the pollution. Indeed, the system is showing signs of recovery after decades of extremely reduced biodiversity according to studies on zooplankton, benthic community, macroalgae, and fish. On the other hand, the nearby estuary of Urdaibai (<50 km) is located at one of the most pristine areas of the North of Spain and is considered a biodiversity hotspot. Although both estuaries have been studied in detail regarding their water quality and eukaryotic organisms, the study of the bacterial communities has been traditionally neglected.

Trade-offs between microbiome diversity and productivity in a stratified microbial mat,"Productivity is a major determinant of ecosystem diversity. Microbial ecosystems are the most diverse on the planet yet very few relationships between diversity and productivity have been reported as compared to macro-ecological studies. Here we evaluated the spatial relationships of productivity and microbiome diversity in a laboratory-cultivated photosynthetic mat. The goal was to determine how spatial diversification of microorganisms drives localized carbon and energy acquisition rates. We measured sub-millimeter depth profiles of net primary-productivity and gross oxygenic photosynthesis in the context of the localized microenvironment and community structure and observed negative correlations between species richness and productivity within the energy-replete, photic zone. Variations between localized community structures were associated with distinct taxa as well as environmental profiles describing a continuum of biological niches. Spatial regions in the photic zone corresponding to high primary productivity and photosynthesis rates had relatively low species richness and high evenness. Hence, this system exhibited negative species-productivity and species–energy relationships. These negative relationships may be indicative of stratified, light-driven microbial ecosystems that are able to be the most productive with a relatively smaller, even distributions of species that specialize within photic zones.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Metabolomics'}",{'Spatial biology'}
Gut Microbiota Regulate Motor Deficits and Neuroinflammation in a Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. However, a functional link between gut bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases remains unexplored. Synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregation of the protein α-synuclein (αSyn), often resulting in motor dysfunction as exemplified by Parkinson's disease (PD). Using mice that overexpress αSyn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of αSyn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Neurology', 'Molecular biology'}",set()

Fruit pulp (mango) and soluble fibre (pectin) impact bacterial diversity and abundance differently within the porcine large intestine,"We examined the effects of a fruit cell wall matrix (mango pulp) and a soluble dietary fibre (pectin) on the porcine large intestinal (LI) bacterial community (caecum, proximal, mid- and distal colon). Pigs were fed one of three diets varying in carbohydrate content: wheat starch only (control-C), or two diets where some starch was substituted by 15% mango pulp(M) or 10% pectin(P). Metabolite end-product analyses were conducted. Bacterial community profiles were analysed through pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. End-product analyses (except propionic acid), revealed significant differences between the three diets, as well as between the four LI sites (P<0.001).  C samples had the lowest short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations. Distally, SCFA values decreased over all diets, while differences between diets were reduced. Proximally, M and P samples had lower ammonia compared with C (P<0.001). The more molecularly-complex M diet was associated with increased bacterial diversity within Cae and PC, compared with C and P groups. For M samples, assigned 16S sequences were most associated with the phylum Bacteroidetes. Within groups, unique species (>1% sequence abundance) were: Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (C), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P), and Lactobacillus mucosae (M). Both forms of fruit fibre led to increased LI bacterial diversity proximally, promoting increased production of beneficial metabolites. Distally, these effects had diminished, which suggests that while these fibres are potentially beneficial to human health proximally, the addition of other, more slowly fermentable carbohydrates, may encourage carbohydrate fermentation along the entire tract.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study'}",{'Dietary fibers'}

Antibiotic-mediated gut microbiome perturbation accelerates development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice,"The early life microbiome plays important roles in host immunological and metabolic development. Because type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence has been increasing substantially in recent decades, we hypothesized that early-life antibiotic use alters gut microbiota that predisposes to disease.  Using NOD mice that are genetically susceptible to T1D, we examined the effects of exposure to either continuous low-dose antibiotics or pulsed therapeutic antibiotics (PAT) early in life, mimicking childhood exposures. We found that in mice receiving PAT, T1D incidence was significantly higher, and microbial community composition and structure differed compared with controls. In pre-diabetic male PAT mice, the intestinal lamina propria had lower Th17 and Treg proportions and intestinal SAA expression than in controls, suggesting key roles in transducing the altered microbiota signals. PAT affected microbial lipid metabolism and host cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression. These findings show that early-life antibiotic treatments alter the gut microbiota and its metabolic capacities, intestinal gene expression, and T-cell populations, accelerating T1D onset in NOD mice.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()

The pediatric intestinal mucosal microbiome remains altered after clinical resolution of inflammatory and ischemic disease,"Background: The pediatric intestinal microbiome is impacted by many factors including age, diet, antibiotics, and environment. We hypothesized that in surgical patients, changes in antibiotics and mechanoluminal stimulation would demonstrate measurable changes in the intestinal microbiome; and that microbial diversity would be reduced without normal mechanoluminal stimulation and with prolonged antibiotic treatment.
Methods: Bacterial 60s16s rRNA was extracted from swabbed samples of 43 intestines from 29 patients, aged 5 days to 13 years old, obtained during initial resection or later stoma closure. Samples were compared using phylogenetic diversity whole tree alpha diversity, unweighted UniFrac distance beta diversity, and by comparing significantly different taxonomic groups.
Results: Microbial community structure varied significantly between obstructive and infectiousinflammatory diseases (p=0.001), with an effect size of 0.99 (0.97, 1.00). This difference persisted even six weeks after return to health. Family Enterobacter and Clostridiaceae predominated in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis or focal intestinal perforation; patients with an obstructive pathology had an abundance of Bacteroides. Comparison of UniFrac distance between paired proximal and distal intestines demonstrated that paired samples were significantly closer than any other comparison.
Conclusions: In infants, infectiousinflammatory and ischemic intestinal pathologies treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics durably alter the intestinal mucosal microbiome.

Metaphenomic Responses of a Native Prairie Soil Microbiome to Moisture Perturbations.,"Soil is a grand challenge. Advances in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics tools have matured to the extent that they can start to be applied to determine the composition of soil microbial communities and how they shift in response to perturbations. However, a current knowledge gap is how perturbations impact functions. This study applied a multi-omics approach to assess the impact of nutrient amendment on the soil microbiome at both taxonomic and functional levels. Soil was sampled from 3 locations in a native prairie from Kansas and glycine was used as a model root exudate to determine the impact of nutrient amendment on the soil microbiome. The samples were analyzed using a suite of omics approaches to capture the appropriate omics level that showed a response to treatment: 16S, metagenomics, metatransciptomics, metaproteomic, lipidomics, and metabolomics. All of the omics approaches consistently showed a significant difference between the 3 soil sampling locations. However, a response to glycine was only detected at the functional level, not at the community level. The metabolomics and metatranscriptomics data in particular, were the most discriminating of all of the data sets. These results demonstrate the value of a multi-omics approach to gain an integrated knowledge of the system. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Multiomics', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
"Stress response, gut microbial diversity, sexual signals, and social interactions in North American barn swallows","Theory predicts that social interactions are dynamically linked to phenotype. Yet because social interactions are difficult to quantify, little is known about the precise details on how interactivity is linked to phenotype. Here we deployed proximity loggers on North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to examine intercorrelations among social interactions, morphology, and features of the phenotype that are sensitive to the social context: stress-induced corticosterone and gut microbial diversity. We analyzed relationships at two spatial scales of interaction: (1) body contact and (2) social interactions occurring between 0.1m and 5m. Network analysis revealed that relationships between social interactions, morphology, corticosterone, and gut microbial diversity varied depending on the sexes of the individuals interacting and the spatial scale of interaction proximity. We found evidence that 1) body contact interactions were related to diversity of socially-transmitted microbes and 2) that looser social interactions were related to signaling traits and corticosterone.

A single early-in-life macrolide course has lasting effects on murine microbial network topology and immunity,"Broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently prescribed to children. Early-childhood represents a dynamic period for the intestinal microbial ecosystem, which is readily shaped by environmental cues; antibiotic-induced disruption of this sensitive community may have long-lasting host consequences. Here we demonstrate that a single pulsed macrolide antibiotic treatment (PAT) course early in life, is sufficient to lead to durable alterations to the murine intestinal microbiota, ileal gene expression, specific intestinal T- cell populations, and secretory IgA expression. A PAT-perturbed microbial community is necessary for host effects and sufficient to transfer delayed sIgA expression. Additionally, early-life antibiotic exposure has lasting and transferable effects on microbial community network topology. Together these results indicate the impact of a single early-life macrolide course in altering the microbiota and modulating host immune phenotypes that persist long after exposure has ceased.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Animal study', 'Immunology'}",set()
Mothers Secretor Status Affects Development of Childrens Microbiota Composition and Function: A Pilot Study. ,"Abstract
Background: One mechanism by which early life environment may influence long term health is through modulation of the gut microbiota. It is widely accepted that the optimal source of nutrition in early life is breast milk, with Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) thought to play an important role in nourishing the developing microbiota. However, mothers with inactive secretor genes have altered HMO composition and quantities in their breast milk. In this pilot study we examine the influence of secretor status and breast-feeding on microbiota composition at 2 to 3 years of age. 

Methods: 37 children and 17 eligible mothers were recruited. Secretor status was determined from blood and saliva samples using hemagglutination inhibition technique and faecal microbiota composition was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results: Secretor status was determined for 28 eligible children with 20 being secretors (S, 71.4%). Eleven of the 17 mothers were secretors (S, 64.7%). Mother’s secretor status had a strong association with their children’s stool microbiota and explained 16.9% of the variation in the weighted UniFrac distances. The children of non-secretor (NS) mothers were found to have increased abundance of Prevotella and OTU related to Prevotella copri compared to children with S-mothers. Our results also suggest that a mother’s secretor status has an even more pronounced effect on the children if they were exclusively breast-fed for at least 4 months of life, with the abundance of Bifidobacterium  being higher in the breast-fed children of S-mothers. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Bacteroides plebeius, a bacterium noted for its capacity to utilise sulphated polysaccharides for growth, was decreased in these children. 

Conclusions: Mother’s secretor status has an impact on children’s microbiota composition at 2 to 3 years of age. This effect was even strongerin children who were exclusively breast-fed for at least 4 months.

Microbiota Transfer Therapy alters gut ecosystem and improves gastrointestinal and autism symptoms: an open-label study,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurobiological disorders that impair social interactions and communication and lead to restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The causes of these disorders remain poorly understood, but gut microbiota, the 1013 bacteria in the human intestines, have been implicated because children with ASD often suffer gastrointestinal (GI) problems that correlate with ASD severity. Several previous studies have reported abnormal gut bacteria in children with ASD. The gut microbiome-ASD connection has been tested in a mouse model of ASD, where the microbiome was mechanistically linked to abnormal metabolites and behavior. Similarly, a study of children with ASD found that oral non-absorbable antibiotic treatment improved GI and ASD symptoms, albeit temporarily.

Additionally, samples were collected every two days for three weeks post-treatment to determine if potential effects would be reversed. Fecal samples from pups born to mothers treated with methamphetamine or control mother treated with saline, were collected starting at an age of 21 days and continuing up until 41 days.  Tissue samples from both mothers and offspring were collected at the end of the experiment which provides us the ability to correlate microbiome changes to neurological or immunological differences. After the microbiome data analysis, important phenotypes will be mapped with epigenetic changes in mothers and offsprings.

However, more than 100 structurally distinct HMOs have been identified, and every woman synthesizes and secretes a signature profile of different oligosaccharides at different concentrations.

Convergence of gut microbiomes in myrmecophagous mammals,"Mammals have diversified into many dietary niches. Specialized myrmecophagous (ant- and termite-eating) placental mammals represent a textbook example of evolutionary convergence driven by extreme diet specialization. Armadillos, anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, and aardwolves thus provide a model system for understanding the potential role of gut microbiota in the convergent adaptation to myrmecophagy. Here, we expand upon previous mammalian gut microbiome studies by using high-throughput barcoded Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in 15 species representing all placental myrmecophagous lineages and their close relatives from zoo- and field-collected samples. We confirm that both diet and phylogeny drive the evolution of mammalian gut microbiota, with cases of convergence in global composition, but also examples of phylogenetic inertia. Our results reveal specialized placental myrmecophages as a spectacular case of large-scale convergence in gut microbiome composition. Indeed, Neighbor-Net networks and beta diversity plots based on UniFrac distances show significant clustering of myrmecophagous species (anteaters, aardvarks, and aardwolves) even though they belong to phylogenetically distant lineages representing different orders. The aardwolf, which diverged from carnivorous hyenas only in the last 10 million years, experienced a convergent shift in the composition of its gut microbiome to become more similar to other myrmecophages. These results confirm diet adaptation to be a major driving factor of convergence in gut microbiome composition over evolutionary timescales. This study sets the scene for future metagenomic studies aiming at evaluating potential convergence in functional gene content in the microbiomes of specialized mammalian myrmecophages.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Zoology', 'Animal study', 'Microbiology'}",set()

Vegetable intake was positively associated with the relative abundance of the Lachnospira genus, while soy, pulse and nut intake was positively associated with the relative abundance of bacteria related to Bacteroides xylanisolvens.

Upgrading syngas fermentation effluent using Clostridium kluyveri in a continuous fermentation,"Background: Syngas fermentations with pure microbial cultures currently results in ethanol/acetic acid mixtures as product. Ethanol has a low market value and is traditionally purified through an energy-intensive distillation, which reduces overall profitability when waste heat is not available. These issues could be circumvented by implementing a biological chain that converts the dilute ethanol/acetic acid mixtures to longer, easier to extract products that attract higher value. Chain elongation has been studied using reactor microbiomes that convert complex organic waste streams to medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs). Few studies exist with pure microbial cultures as a biotechnology production platform. The upgrading of syngas fermentation effluent with pure cultures has not yet been shown. 
Results: Here, we focus on the use of pure cultures of C. kluyveri to convert ethanol/acetic acid mixtures to MCCAs. We describe the operation of two continuous bioreactors and factors influencing the productivity of the culture, such as organic loading rate (OLR), presence or absence of in-line product extraction, and pH. Increased loading rates resulted in proportionally higher volumetric production rates of n-caproic acid, up to 40 mM·d-1 (4.64 g·L-1·d-1) and carbon conversion efficiencies of 90% or higher. Also caprylic acid production was observed for the first time with this organism (up to 2.19 ± 0.34 mM in batch). The use of real effluent from syngas fermentation, without added yeast extract, did not decrease productivities. The metabolism of C. kluyveri was however inhibited at the low pH values (5.50) for which reactor microbiomes were successfully elongating.
Conclusions: Overall, we show that syngas fermentation effluent can be converted to MCCAs under defined conditions, but several challenges remain for the use of C. kluyveri as a production strain.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Biotechnology', 'Microbial ecology'}",set()
Intestinal Adaptation in Proximal and Distal Segments: Two Epithelial Responses Diverge After Intestinal Separation,"Introduction: In short bowel syndrome (SBS), luminal factors influence adaptation in which truncated intestine increases villus lengths and crypt depths to increase nutrient absorption. No study has evaluated the effect of adaptation within the distal intestine after intestinal separation. We evaluated multiple conditions including Igf1r inhibition in proximal and distal segments after intestinal resection to evaluate the epithelial effects of the absence of mechanoluminal stimulation. 

Methods: SBS was created in adult male zebrafish by performing proximal stoma/distal intestinal ligation. These were compared to sham zebrafish. Groups were treated with NVP-AEW541; DMSO, a vehicle control; or water for 2 weeks. Proximal and distal intestine were analyzed by H&E for villus epithelial circumference (VEP), inner epithelial perimeter (IEP), and circumference. BrdU+ cells and the microbiome were evaluated.  An alternate microCT approach was employed to assess surface area

Results: Proximal intestine demonstrated significantly increased adaptation compared to sham proximal intestine, whereas distal intestine showed no adaptation in the absence of luminal flow. Addition of Igf1r inhibitor resulted in decreased adaption in the distal intestine but an increase in distal proliferative cells. There was no difference in alpha diversity of the microbiome between all groups. Micro CT evaluation of surface area conferred no benefit in data analysis.

 Conclusion: Luminal flow in conjunction with SBS significantly increases intestinal adaption within the proximal intestine while addition of an Igf1r inhibitor diminishes adaptation in both proximal and distal limbs, while increasing distal proliferative cells.

Responses of gut microbiota to diet composition and weight loss in lean and obese mice,"Changes in body weight are often consequences of changes in diet, and alterations in the diet can result in changes in gut microbial community composition (Turnabugh et al., X, Ley et al, 2006). In studies in which both weight and diet changes occur together, the alteration of the gut microbiota could be attributed either to changes in body fat content of the host or to changes in diet. To distinguished between these two possibilities, Hildebrandt and colleagues used a mouse model that remains lean on a high-fat diet through elevated energy expenditure (RELMbeta-KO) to show that a high fat diet alone can cause an alteration in the microbiota even though host weight remained contant (Hildebrandt et al, 2009). These findings raise another question: are changes in the microbiota due to excess calorie consumption, or the fat content of the diet itself? Here we address this question by comparing the microbiota of weight-reduced DIO mice (DIO-WR) fed a high fat diet with microbiotas of mice of the same weight fed a control diet ad-libitum. This allowed us to assess the contribution of diet composition to the gut microbiota in wildtype animals whose weight was manipulated by controlling food intake.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",{'Obesity'}
A pyrosequencing study in twins shows that gastrointestinal microbial profiles vary with inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes,"The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to have an important role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Interindividual variation and an inability to detect less abundant bacteria have made it difficult to correlate specific bacteria with disease. We used 454 pyrotag sequencing to determine the compositions of microbial communities in feces samples collected from a cohort of 40 twin pairs who were concordant or discordant for CD or UC, and in mucosal samples from a subset of the cohort. The cohort primarily comprised patients who were in remission, but also some with active disease. The profiles of the microbial community differed with disease phenotypes; relative amounts of bacterial populations correlated with IBD phenotypes. The microbial compositions of individuals with CD differed from those of healthy individuals, but were similar between healthy individuals and individuals with UC. Profiles from individuals with CD that predominantly involved the ileum differed from those with CD that predominantly involved the colon; several bacterial populations increased or decreased with disease type.

Wollam_Olefsky_Fpr1,"In countries around the world, increased rates of obesity have led to a corresponding rise in obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), posing a global health threat. An important link between diet and metabolism is the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract, the composition of which changes dramatically in obesity and has been implicated in T2D. Understanding the mechanisms by which the commensal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract interact with the host to influence metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and how these are altered in obesity, will provide important insight into the causes of T2D. Although many correlations have been made between the gut microbiome and metabolic dysfunction, specific mechanisms remain to be described. Our aim is to investigate microbiome-host interactions in the context of diet-induced obesity and T2D with the goal of identifying potential targets for therapeutic treatment. We have recently discovered that levels of the bacterially-produced N-formyl peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF) are elevated in the systemic circulation of obese mice fed a 60% high fat diet (HFD), and that loss of the Fpr1 receptor, which recognizes this peptide, leads to protection from obesity-induced glucose intolerance. Furthermore, initial 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies have revealed that Fpr1-knockout animals (Fpr1-KO) display a strikingly different microbiome composition in obese HFD conditions, suggesting that feedback mechanisms may exist between the intestinal microbiome and Fpr1 signaling to influence metabolism. How this occurs, and whether this is diet-dependent, remains to be determined. Additional sequencing and metabolomics analyses of feces from wild-type (WT) and Fpr1-KO animals raised under different dietary conditions, as well as analyses of obese animals treated with or without an Fpr1 antagonist, will be useful in fully investigating these findings.

Microbial communities of lycaenid butterflies do not correlate with host diet,"Herbivorous lifestyles present numerous challenges, yet many animals – especially insects – are successful herbivores. There are a variety of herbivore counteradaptations to plant defenses, and growing body of research describes the role of symbiotic gut bacteria in mediating herbivorous diets among insects. However, persistent bacterial symbioses have not been described in detail for Lepidoptera, despite being one of the largest herbivore groups on earth. We surveyed larvae from 31 species of lycaenid butterflies and compared the gut bacterial communities associated with species with diverse diets. Contrary to our expectations, we find that the bacterial communities of carnivorous and herbivorous caterpillars do not differ in richness, diversity, or composition. Many of the observed bacterial genera are commonly found in soil and plant surfaces, and we detected known homopteran endosymbionts in the guts of homopterophagous species, suggesting that larvae acquire many of the gut bacteria from their food and environment. These results indicate that lycaenid butterflies do not rely on bacterial symbioses to mediate their diverse diets, and provide further evidence of depauperate bacterial communities among Lepidoptera.

This has immediate applications in both determining cell culturing and natural products discovery, which have both implications in medicine and learning about new organisms. The rigorous characterization of a given microbe's metabolic niche can determine the nutrients required for the organism to survive, as well as the secondary metabolites secreted by the microbe.

Over five million people are currently infected, with a mortality rate of 12,000/year. This parasite is endemic to Latin America, where 13% of the population is at risk of infection. In addition, there are up to a million T. cruzi-infected individuals in the United States, a large number of which live in Southern California.

Repeated sleep disruption in mice leads to persistent shifts in the fecal microbiome and metabolome,"It has been established in recent years that the gut microbiome plays a role in health and disease, potentially via alterations in metabolites that influence host physiology. Although sleep disruption and gut dysbiosis have been associated with many of the same diseases, studies investigating the gut microbiome in the context of sleep disruption have yielded inconsistent results, and have not assessed the fecal metabolome. We exposed mice to five days of sleep disruption followed by four days of ad libitum recovery sleep, and assessed the fecal microbiome and fecal metabolome at multiple timepoints using 16S rRNA gene amplicons and untargeted LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. We found global shifts in both the microbiome and metabolome in the sleep-disrupted group on the second day of recovery sleep, when most sleep parameters had recovered to baseline levels. We observed an increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio, along with decreases in the genus Lactobacillus, phylum Actinobacteria, and genus Bifidobacterium in sleep-disrupted mice compared to control mice. The latter two taxa remained low at the fourth day post-sleep disruption. We also identified multiple classes of fecal metabolites that were differentially abundant in sleep-disrupted mice, some of which are physiologically relevant and commonly influenced by the microbiome. This included bile acids, and inference of microbial functional gene content suggested reduced levels of the microbial bile salt hydrolase gene in sleep-disrupted mice. Overall, this study adds to the evidence base linking disrupted sleep to the gut microbiome and expands it to the fecal metabolome, identifying sleep disruption-sensitive bacterial taxa and classes of metabolites that may serve as therapeutic targets to improve health after poor sleep.​",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Faecal microbiota and Fat Free Mass Index in 2 to 3 year old well-nourished Australian children.  ,"Background
Alterations in microbiota composition are proposed to be causally related to the development of overweight and obesity while maturation of the gut microbiota has been shown to be related to childhood growth. However, while there has been a focus on the association between microbiota and body size in recent literature, the association with body composition is poorly characterised in humans. 
Method 
This study utilises previously reported data to explore the association between faecal microbiota composition and body composition in a cohort of 36 well-nourished 2 to 3 year old Australian children. 
Results
Microbiota composition (weighted UniFrac distance) was shown to be significantly associated with FFMI (Fat Free Mass Index) Z score (p = 0.027, adonis) in boys but not girls. In boys, FFMI Z score was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of an OTU belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family (Rho = 0.822, p < 0.001, pFDR = 0.002, n = 18). At a FDR < 0.2, FFMI Z score in boys was positively associated with the relative abundance of OTU related to Dorea formicigenerans and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and negatively correlated to an OTU related to Bacteroides cellulosilyticus.
Conclusions
These results suggest that microbiota may influence growth and body composition in early life through the modulation of fat free mass accrual, particularly in males.

NKT cell- NASH murine model - Microbiome: study 1,"Causal and modulatory mechanisms underlying Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not yet understood and an effective therapeutic approach to halt this disease is still lacking. Using a murine model of NASH, we have identified distinct roles of type I and type II natural killer T (NKT) cells: in Jα 18-/- mice, which lacks type I NKT cells specifically, steatohepatitis / fibrosis which determines the terminal stages of NASH, is significantly compromised elucidating a pathological role of these cells. We also have found that a RAR- inhibitor (Tazarotene) and a type II NKT activator (Miltefosine), intervene in the NKT cells in vivo and prevent NASH progression in mice. Our preliminary data also show involvement of specific subsets of dendritic cell, that migrate from gut and stimulate type I NKT cells at different stages of disease. We wish to investigate whether gut microbiota and other gut factors are involved in NKT cell-mediated regulation of NASH and compare with other liver diseases. 

NASH is a major type of Non-alcohol-induced fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the most frequent chronic liver disease and affects 10–20% of the population in developed countries and is increasing in prevalence with the rise of diabetes and obesity. NAFLD is characterized by abnormal accumulation of fat within the liver, or steatosis, that can progress to severe inflammatory cell infiltration or NASH accompanied by fibrosis, necrosis or in some cases leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unravelling the NKT cell-mediated regulation in NASH would allow development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities along with improving the knowledge in basic biology of liver diseases.

Patterns in gut microbiota similarity associated with degree of sociality among sex classes of a Neotropical primate.,"Studies of human and domestic animal models indicate that related individuals and those that spend the most time in physical contact typically have more similar gut microbial communities. However, few studies have examined these factors in wild mammals where complex social dynamics and a variety of interacting environmental factors may impact the patterns observed in controlled systems. Here, we explore the effect of host kinship and time spent in social contact on the gut microbiota of wild, black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). Our results indicate that closely related individuals had less similar gut microbial communities than non-related individuals. However, the effect was small. In contrast, as previously reported in baboons and chimpanzees, individuals that spent more time in contact (0 m) and close proximity (0-1 m) had more similar gut microbial communities. This pattern was driven by adult female-adult female dyads, which generally spend more time in social contact than adult male-adult male dyads or adult male-adult female dyads. Relative abundances of individual microbial genera such as Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus were also more similar in individuals that spent more time in contact or close proximity. Overall, our data suggest that even in arboreal primates that live in small social groups and spend a relatively low proportion of their time in physical contact, social interactions are associated with variation in gut microbiota composition. Additionally, these results demonstrate that within a given host species, subgroups of individuals may interact with the gut microbiota differently.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",set()

Effect of dietary lignan on pig cecal microbiome,"High plant lignan intake is associated with a number of health benefits, possibly induced by the lignan metabolite enterolactone (ENL). The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in converting dietary lignans into ENL, and epidemiological studies have shown that use of antibiotics is associated with lower levels of ENL. Here, we investigate the link between antibiotic use and lignan metabolism in pigs using LC-MS/MS. The effect of lignan intake and antibiotic use on the gut microbial community and the pig metabolome is studied by 16S rRNA sequencing and non-targeted LC-MS. Treatment with antibiotics resulted in substantially lower concentrations of ENL compared to concentrations detected in untreated animals, whereas the plasma concentrations of plant lignans were unchanged. Both diet and antibiotic treatment affected the clustering of urinary metabolites, and significantly altered the proportions of taxa in the gut microbiota. Diet, but not antibiotic treatment, affected the plasma lipid profile and a lower concentration of LDL-cholesterol was observed in the pigs fed a high lignan diet. This study provides solid support for the associations between ENL concentrations and use of antibiotics found in humans, and indicates that the lower ENL concentration may be a consequence of the ecological changes in the microbiota.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Animal study', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Palmyra Atoll Corallimorph and Bleaching Surveys,"Scleractinian corals host species-specific microbial communities known as the “coral holobiont.” This community of microbes includes bacteria, viruses, and symbiotic zooxanthellae. It has been shown that changes in abiotic conditions such as ocean warming or storm disturbance can alter this community and result in a decline in coral health. However, although a number of studies have looked at shifts in the coral holobiont community when exposed to abiotic stressors, few have examined biotic stressors such as exposure to invasive species. Palmyra Atoll, a remote, uninhabited island in the Central Pacific, has been undergoing an invasion of the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii. Corallimorphs are Cnidarians that lack any calcified structure. The species R. howesii contains large stinging cells (nematocysts) that appear to cause tissue necrosis in hard corals as they grow over them. Despite the corallimorphs’ competitive dominance on the reef and invasive potential, little is known about their actual mechanisms of invasion, including microbial or chemical agents that may be involved. 

 In addition to the local stressor of the corallimorph, we also have the chance to compare species-specific responses of corals to a wide-scale bleaching event that occurred at Palmyra Atoll in 2015. Complimentary samples were taken of bleached corals within the same taxa so that a comparison between the biotic stressor of the corallimorph could be compared to the in situ, abiotic stressor of bleaching due to elevated temperatures and irradiance. This is a unique data set that will provide for novel comparison of the two stressors on corals in a relatively pristine environment.

Diet and probiotics exert location-specific effects on the gut microbiome in poultry,"The gut needs to maintain a balance between cultivating beneficial bacteria, and excluding pathogenic species.  This balance is a target for antibiotics, probiotic, prebiotics, and other treatments, all seeking to promote more of the good bacteria, less of the bad, or both.  With biomedical and agricultural technologies increasingly focusing on more targeted approaches instead of the brute force of antibiotics, it is vital to understand how bacterial treatments interact with established microbiomes to affect the host.  In order to do this, we must also define how physiological differences throughout the gastrointestinal system (GI) affect the distribution of bacterial taxa, as these location-specific microbial populations may react differently to dietary treatments.  We collected digesta from the GI of poultry receiving one of two diets with or without a probiotic.  Six locations were sampled from each animal: crop, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum.  Analysis of 16S rDNA sequence data revealed that GI location is the strongest predictor of similarity between samples, influencing the microbiome more than diet or probiotic treatment.  Of the locations evaluated, the cecum has the highest level of phylogenetic diversity, however, the ileal microbiome may experience more treatment-specific changes than the cecum.  In probiotic-fed animals, the ileum sees a reduction in potentially inflammatory bacteria, and in silico metagenomics analysis of the ileal microbiome suggests that metabolism of some short chain fatty acids, propionate and butyrate, may increase.  Butyrate in particular is known to reduce inflammatory host mediators, and may work to improve gut health through reduced inflammation-related tissue damage.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Animal study'}",{'Animal Study'}

Influence of cystinosis and thiol based drugs on microbiome,"Cystinosis is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by a defective lysosomal transporter of cystine, cystinosin (CTNS gene).  The defect leads to cystine accumulation that affects all organs, but especially damaging to kidney function, resulting in end stage renal failure in over 90% of patients before the age of 20.  The current treatment for patients is an orally consumed aminothiol drug (cysteamine) that rescues accumulated lysosomal cystine through an alternate transporter following mixed disulfide formation with cysteine.  Cystinotic patients often exhibit GI complications that include dysmotility, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and abdominal swelling, in part due to a daily regimen of cyteamine. Young kids often require a gastric tube to tolerate medications and many patients stop taking the drug. The role and response of the microbiome in patients may be beneficial to fully understanding the cause of these GI complications, potentially offering additional options for symptom treatment and prevention.  Considering that certain microbes are more or less suited to proliferate in a sulfur rich environment (either inorganic or organic sulfur), there may be a significant role for the microbiome in cystinosis and/or treatment of the disease.  We will investigate changes to the microbiome longitudinally in cystinotic mice (CTNS -/-) over 10 days, and compare these to  WT mice and cystinotic mice that are treated with the drugs cysteamine or cystamine.

As an additional aspect to the study, we will collect feces of WT, non-treated, and treated mice longitudinally over the course of a 10-day study with cysteamine vs cystamine to determine changes in the microbiome/metabolomic profiles related to intra-cellular cystine accumulation and microbial metabolism of the aminothiol drug forms.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Animal study'}",set()
"Mosquito Microbiome Dynamics, a Background for Prevalence and Seasonality of West Nile Virus","Symbiotic microbial communities augment host phenotype, including defense against pathogen carriage and infection. We sampled the microbial communities in eleven adult mosquito host species from six regions in southern Ontario, Canada over three years. Of the factors examined, we found that host species was the largest driver of the microbiota, with remarkable phylosymbiosis between host and microbiota. Seasonal shifts of the microbiome were consistently repeated over the three-year period, while region had little impact.  Both host species and seasonal shifts in microbiota were associated with patterns of West Nile virus (WNV) in these mosquitoes. The highest prevalence of WNV, with a seasonal spike each year in August, was in the Culex pipiens/restuans complex, and reduced WNV prevalence followed increased relative abundance of Wolbachia in this species. Indeed, mean temperature, but not precipitation, was significantly correlated with Wolbachia abundance. This suggests that at higher temperatures Wolbachia is reduced leading to greater susceptibility to WNV in the subsequent generation of C. pipiens/restuans hosts. Different mosquito genera harbored significantly different bacterial communities, and presence or abundance of Wolbachia were primarily associated with these differences. We identified several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Wolbachia that drive overall microbial community differentiation among mosquito taxa, locations and timepoints. Distinct Wolbachia OTUs were consistently found to dominate microbiomes of Cx. pipiens/restuans, and of Coquilletidia perturbans. Seasonal fluctuations of several other microbial taxa included Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus, Methylobacterium, Asaia, Pantoea, Acinetobacter johnsonii, Pseudomonas, and Mycoplasma.

Comparison of oral collection methods for studies of microbiota - Bangladesh,"Background: A number of cohort studies have collected Scope mouthwash samples by mail which are being used for microbiota measurements. We evaluated the stability of Scope mouthwash samples at ambient temperature and determined the comparability of Scope mouthwash with saliva collection using the OMNIgene ORAL kit.

Methods: Fifty-three healthy volunteers from Mayo Clinic and fifty cohort members from Bangladesh provided oral samples. One aliquot of the OMNIgene ORAL and Scope mouthwash were frozen immediately and one aliquot of the Scope mouthwash remained at ambient temperature for four days and then was frozen. DNA was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced using the HiSeq. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated.

Results: The overall stability of the Scope mouthwash samples was relatively high for alpha and beta diversity. For example, the meta-analyzed ICC for the Shannon Index was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.96). Similarly, the ICCs for the relative abundance of the top 25 genera were generally high. The comparability of the two sample types was relatively low when measured using ICCs, but were increased by using a Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) to compare the rank order of individuals.

Conclusions: Overall, the Scope mouthwash samples appear to be stable at ambient temperature which suggests that oral rinse samples received by the mail can be used for microbial analyses. However, Scope mouthwash samples were distinct compared to OMNIgene ORAL samples.

These cells also express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and interleukin-10, and directly suppress liver cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which prevent emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma and express a limited repertoire of T-cell receptors against tumour-associated antigens. Whereas CD8+ T-cell ablation accelerates hepatocellular carcinoma, genetic or pharmacological interference with IgA+ cell generation attenuates liver carcinogenesis and induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated regression of established hepatocellular carcinoma.

Effects of processed meat and drinking water nitrate on oral and fecal microbial populations in a controlled feeding study,"Background
One mechanism that can explain the link between processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) is the production of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in the gastrointestinal tract. Oral and gut microbes metabolize ingested proteins (a source of secondary and tertiary amines and amides) and can reduce nitrate to nitrite, generating potentially carcinogenic NOCs.

Objective
We evaluated whether nitrate/nitrite in processed meat or water influences the fecal or salivary microbiota.

Design
In this dietary intervention study, 63 volunteers consumed diets high in conventional processed meats for two weeks, switched to diets high in poultry for two weeks, and then consumed phytochemical-enriched conventional processed or low-nitrite processed meat diets for two weeks. During the intervention, they drank water with low nitrate concentrations and consumed a healthy diet with low antioxidants. Then the volunteers drank nitrate-enriched water for 1 week, in combination with one of the four different diets. We measured creatinine-adjusted urinary nitrate levels and characterized the oral and fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

Results
Using linear mixed models, we found that, compared to baseline, urinary nitrate levels were reduced during the phytochemical-enriched low-nitrite meat diet (p-value = 0.009) and modestly during the poultry diet (p-value = 0.048). In contrast, urinary nitrate increased after 1-week of drinking nitrate-enriched water (p-value<10−5). Nitrate-enriched water, but not processed meats with or without phytochemicals, altered the saliva microbial population (p-value ≤0.001), and significantly increased abundance of 8 bacterial taxa, especially genus Neisseria and other nitrate-reducing taxa. Meats, phytochemicals and nitrate-enriched water had no significant effects on saliva alpha diversity or any diversity parameter measured for the fecal microbiota.

Conclusion
These findings support the hypothesis that drinking high nitrate water increases oral nitrate-reducing bacteria, which likely results in increased NOC.

Investigating Diversity of Brachybacterium and Brevibacterium Species Isolated from Cheese Rinds,"In order to characterize the microbial diversity normally found on cheese, 137 cheese rind communities from 10 different countries were sampled and sequenced.  This survey found a number of bacteria and fungi genera that are frequently found in cheese rind communities. Additionally, a main finding of this initial survey was that the microbial diversity found in cheeses produced in different locations across the globe is more related to the type of cheese rather than to where the cheese was produced.  However, anecdotally, these cheeses are thought to have distinct characteristics depending on their geographic origin; this is perhaps reminiscent of terroir, which is the concept that the land on which a crop is grown imparts some special quality to the plant and its product.  Because the microbial communities in these cheeses are responsible for many of the resulting flavors of the cheese, this brings up an interesting question of whether subtle flavor differences may be due to subtle changes in microbial composition that are not obvious based on a higher-level classification survey of the microbial diversity present.  For example, it is possible that there are species or strain level differences not detected using the previous methods that create distinct flavor profiles, even though the overall community composition is relatively consistent for a certain type of cheese.  Using paired genome sequencing and mass spectrometry, this study investigates these differences in Brevibacterium and Brachybacterium isolates from diverse cheese rind communities.

Mice fed L. plantarum NCIMB8826 exhibited intermediate (non-significant) reductions in intestinal inflammation compared to the TNBS-administered and healthy controls. By comparison, intestinal tissue damage and serum IL6 levels were higher in mice given L. plantarum LM0419 and equivalent to the TNBS-treated mice. Both strains survived digestive tract transit in equal numbers and did not result in global changes to the bacterial composition in the mouse stools and cecal contents either prior to or after TNBS administration. Instead, taxonomic analysis showed that mice consuming wild-type L. plantarum but not LM0419 contained lower proportions of Mucispirillum (Deferribacteres phylum) in the feces prior to TNBS administration and Parabacteroides (Bacteroidetes phylum) in the cecum after disease induction. Parabacteroides also positively associated with disease activity and host inflammatory markers. These findings suggest a role for bacteriocin production by probiotic Lactobacillus in benefiting digestive tract health.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Sucrose metabolism is a fitness determinant of Lactobacillus plantarum in the digestive tract,"We previously showed Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 (a single colony isolate of L. plantarum NCIMB 8826) survived in significantly higher numbers in mice fed high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) compared to low-fat, polysaccharide-rich diet (LFPPD). However, the importance individual dietary components in the HFHSD on L. plantarum intestinal survival is unknown. To investigate the contribution of dietary sucrose on L. plantarum in vivo, we constructed a mutant of L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 deficient in sucrose utilization (strain LM0187). Strain LM0187 survived in 2.6-fold higher numbers compared to wild-type cells in the mouse digestive tract (P=0.0002). Neither strain changed the intestinal microbiota composition according to 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the mouse stools. However, co-occurrence analysis identified different microbial interactions upon ΔscrB feeding including new negative correlations between Cetenibacterium and Dialister as well as Clostridiales and Coprococcus.  Fecal metabolome measurements identified modest but non-overlapping changes upon NCIMB8826-R and LM0187 feeding compared to the PBS-fed controls. Notably, fecal glycerol concentration in LM0187-fed mice were significantly higher than both NCIMB8826-R and control mice accompanied with reduced quantities of the predicted glycerol metabolism gene (K04069, pyruvate formate lyase activating enzyme) in this group. Taken together, we found that sucrose metabolism lowers L. plantarum in vivo fitness, likely as a result of changed interactions and metabolism of the intestinal microbiota.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Biochemistry'}",set()
Impact of Pathogen Colonization on Mouse Vaginal Microbiota,"This project seeks to define the impact of three reproductive tract pathogens, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Group B Streptococcus, on mucosal host immune responses and perturbations in vaginal native flora using mouse models of vaginal infection. T. vaginalis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted pathogen and is associated with preterm birth, infertility and bacterial vaginosis. C. albicans is the primary pathogen in vulvovaginal candidiasis, a condition affecting up to 75% of women of child-bearing age, and is also linked to preterm birth and low birth weight. Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a frequent cause of neonatal sepsis and morbidity, is a commensal vaginal microbe which can also cause preterm birth and urinary tract infections. Together, these pathogens represent a collection of leading etiologic agents of infectious disease in the field of women’s reproductive health.

Mouse microbiome response to Streptococcus pyogenes infection,"Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) is a leading human pathogen in terms of morbidity and mortality. We recently identified that the Sp protease SpeB directly matures the pro-IL-1beta inflammatory cytokine independent of its canonical inflammasome regulator (LaRock et al. Science Immunology 2016). The resulting inflammation represses Sp’s ability to cause the deadly ‘flesh-eating’ necrotizing fasciitis; infection can be potentiated through mutations inactivating the bacterial protease, or by inhibition of IL-1beta signaling, as is done therapeutically for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Why does Sp encode this protease if it inhibits virulence? We find this same inflammatory mechanism also functions during common pharyngitis infection ‘strep throat,’ but instead to the benefit of the pathogen. For over 40 years it has been known that microbial composition of the nasal and oral cavities influences Sp’s colonization, and we hypothesize strep throat is a SpeB-driven immunopathology wherein Sp utilizes IL-1beta-mediated inflammation to disrupt this community to establish colonization. Here we address this question by comparing the microbiota of mice receiving IL-1beta inhibitor and infected with wild-type or SpeB-mutant Sp.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a leading human pathogen in morbidity and mortality. We recently identified that the GAS protease SpeB directly matures the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta independent of its canonical inflammasome regulator (LaRock et al. Science Immunology 2016). The resulting inflammation prevents flesh-eating necrotizing fasciitis; infection is potentiated when GAS develops pathoadaptive mutations inhibiting SpeB or when IL-1beta is blocked by anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals. Our preliminary data shows this same inflammatory mechanism is instead beneficial for GAS during common ""strep throat"" pharyngitis. This is in line with an emergent paradigm showing that pathogen success is not solely due to immune evasion; some take advantage of immune activation to acquire nutrients, suppress competitors, or otherwise promote their virulence. We hypothesize ""strep throat"" is a SpeB-driven immunopathology wherein GAS utilizes IL-1beta-mediated inflammation to disrupt the microbiota or gain nutrients. Throat infections where GAS is the suspect pathogen (notwithstanding their typically viral etiology) are a leading indication for antibiotic proscription. Our model anticipates microbiome-modulating prebiotics and probiotics, targeted anti-inflammatories, and SpeB-specific inhibitors could provide alternative prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for these infections and help curb the spread of antibiotic resistance within this species, and others, as well as prevent millions from being exposed to danger from dysbiosis-induced pathologies.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Eating behavior development in infants,"Currently, 1/3 of children and 2/3 of adults are overweight/obese. While the social ecological model identifies many factors affecting the development of obesity, there is a lack of understanding of the individual-level differences that are contributing to this risk. The parent grant will identify infant eating behavior phenotypes that are associated with rapid infant weight gain, such as poor satiety responsiveness, increased working for food, and the soothing and hedonic effects of sucrose. While they will examine potential predictors of these behaviors, e.g., maternal obesity, eating behavior, diet, and stress, they do not examine individual level biologic differences that may be contributing to these infant eating behaviors. In this proposal, we will focus on the gut microbiome. The composition and diversity of the gut microbiome has been associated with weight status, and can affect one’s metabolism, physiology, and behavior. As such, our goal is to examine the relationship between the infant gut microbiome and fecal metabolomics to early infant eating behaviors and weight gain trajectory during the first year of life. We will collect stool samples and examine the microbial composition and diversity of 325 infant-mother dyads at 2 weeks, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months of life.  We will examine how baseline composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, as well as changes in this biome, relate to infant eating behaviors (particularly satiety responsiveness, working for food, and the soothing and hedonic effects of sucrose) and weight gain trajectory during this time frame. With the mother’s microbiome as well as her and the infant’s dietary, perinatal, and medical history, we will also examine factors that affect the development of the infant microbiome. 16S rRNA and fecal metabolomics will be used to identify the composition and diversity of this gut microbiome and its byproducts. This work will lay the groundwork for future exploration of microbial-gene interactions and how the microbiome may be affecting hormonal and neurologic control of eating behaviors. Ultimately, this work will contribute to the basic biologic understanding of eating behaviors that are contributing to the development of abnormal weight gain trajectories and identify potential targets of intervention.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Developmental biology', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()

KatharoSeq enables high-throughput microbiome analysis from low-biomass samples,"Microbiome analyses of low-biomass samples are challenging because of contamination and inefficient amplification, leading many investigators to employ low-throughput methods with minimal controls. We developed a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos, “clean”), that outperforms single tube extractions while processing four times faster. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as little as 50 cells, and correctly identifies 90.6% (S.E. 0.013) of reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon (“16S” below) and shotgun metagenome (“shotgun” below) analyses of the Jet Propulsion Lab Spacecraft Assembly Facility, SAF, (n=192, 96), 52 rooms from a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU, (n=388, 384), and an endangered abalone rearing facility (n=192, 192), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes, reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains thirty two sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm with four (Acinetobacter lwoffi, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in over 75 % of the samples. Using microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffi, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we predict a patient disease outcome from the built environment, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input.

The effects of captivity on the mammalian gut microbiome,"Recent studies are increasingly noting the effect of captivity or the built environment on the microbiome of humans and other animals. As symbiotic microbes are essential to many aspects of biological functions (e.g., digestive and immune functions), it is important to understand how lifestyle differences can impact the microbiome, and consequently the health of hosts. Animals living in captivity experience a range of changes that may influence the gut microbiome, such as diet changes, treatments, and reduced contact with other individuals, species and variable environmental substrates that act as sources of bacterial diversity. Thus far, initial results from previous studies point to a pattern of decreased bacterial diversity in captive animals, however, these studies are relatively limited in the scope of species that have been examined. We present a novel dataset that includes paired wild and captive samples from 41 mammal species to investigate generalizable patterns of the effects captivity has on the microbiome. In comparing the wild to the captive condition, our results indicate that alpha diversity of the gut bacteria remains consistent in some mammalian hosts (bovids, giraffes, anteaters, and aardvarks), declines in the captive condition in some hosts (canids, primates, and equids), and increases in the captive condition in one host taxon (rhinoceros). Differences in gut bacterial beta diversity between the captive and wild state were observed for most of the mammal taxa, except the even-toed ungulates (bovids and giraffes). Additionally, beta diversity variation was also strongly influenced by host taxonomic group, diet type, and gut fermentation physiology. Bacterial taxa that responded most strongly to captivity included members of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Overall, the patterns that we observe will inform a range of disciplines from veterinary practice to captive breeding efforts for biological conservation. Furthermore, bacterial taxa that persist in the captive state provide unique insight into symbiotic relationships with the host. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Biology'}",set()
Ground Beef Microbiome Changes with Antimicrobial Decontamination Interventions and Product Storage ,"Numerous studies have been conducted on microbial safety and shelf life of ground beef, though limited work has been done using a culture-independent approach. The objective of this study was to characterize the fresh ground beef microbiome and the effect that antimicrobial interventions, applied to beef trim before grinding, and product storage have on community composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Beef trimmings were treated with antimicrobials and an antioxidant. Samples were ground, loafed, and overwrapped before being packaged in modified-atmosphere packaging. Samples were in dark storage for 21 days followed by five days in retail display. Periodically during storage, samples were collected for microbiological analysis and DNA isolation. Due to low microbial biomass, only 52 of 210 samples were included in the final analysis. These samples represented two antimicrobial treatments (peroxyacetic acid, and a sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate blend) and a control, from day-15 of dark storage and day-5 of retail display. As sample age increased, so did the number of raw reads (P<0.001) and aerobic plate counts (P<0.001), which were correlated (r=0.94, P=0.017). Across all samples, lactic acid bacteria were most abundant followed by Enterobacteriaceae; several rare taxa were also identified (namely Geobacillus, Thermus, and Sporosarcina). Antimicrobial treatment altered the bacterial alpha (P<0.001) and beta (P=0.001) diversity, while storage day altered alpha (P=0.001) diversity. Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance differed (P<0.05) among treatments and was highest in control samples.

Intestinal FXR agonism protects against colon cancer via secondary metabolites communication,"The complex interactions between the host and the gut microbiota are a crossroad of nutritional and hormonal signals with the potential to modulate disease. The Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), initially identified as a bile acid sensor in Evan’s lab, is widely accepted as the master regulator of BA homeostasis coordinating the gut-liver metabolic axis. In addition, our preliminary in vivo data show that intestinally-favored FXR activation protects against colon cancer in two classical colon cancer mice models under either normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. Given that environmental factors including dietary choices correlate with the progression of colon cancer from somatic mutation to metastatic invasion, we hypothesize that the beneficial effect of enteric FXR on gut health may cross-talk with gut microbiota through 2nd metabolites, such as BAs and FFAs. In exploring this notion, we will investigate how metabolic messengers including BAs communicate with gut microbiota to coordinate host responses.

Associations of fecal microbial profiles with breast cancer and nonmalignant breast disease in the Ghana Breast Health Study,"The gut microbiota may play a role in breast cancer etiology by regulating hormonal, metabolic and immunologic pathways. We investigated associations of fecal bacteria with breast cancer and nonmalignant breast disease in a case-control study conducted in Ghana, a country with rising breast cancer incidence and mortality. To do this, we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize bacteria in fecal samples collected at the time of breast biopsy (N = 379 breast cancer cases, N = 102 nonmalignant breast disease cases, N = 414 population-based controls). We estimated associations of alpha diversity (observed amplicon sequence variants [ASVs], Shannon index, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity), beta diversity (Bray-Curtis and unweighted/weighted UniFrac distance), and the presence and relative abundance of select taxa with breast cancer and nonmalignant breast disease using multivariable unconditional polytomous logistic regression. All alpha diversity metrics were strongly, inversely associated with odds of breast cancer and for those in the highest relative to lowest tertile of observed ASVs, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.21 (0.13-0.36; Ptrend < .001). Alpha diversity associations were similar for nonmalignant breast disease and breast cancer grade/molecular subtype. All beta diversity distance matrices and multiple taxa with possible estrogen-conjugating and immune-related functions were strongly associated with breast cancer (all Ps < .001). There were no statistically significant differences between breast cancer and nonmalignant breast disease cases in any microbiota metric. In conclusion, fecal bacterial characteristics were strongly and similarly associated with breast cancer and nonmalignant breast disease.

Farm-like indoor microbiota in non-farm homes protects children from asthma development,"Asthma prevalence has increased in epidemic proportions with urbanization, but growing up on traditional farms offers protection even today1. The asthma-protective effect of farms appears to be associated with rich home dust microbiota2,3, which could be used to model a health-promoting indoor microbiome. Here we show by modeling differences in house dust microbiota composition between farm and non-farm homes of Finnish birth cohorts4 that in children who grow up in non-farm homes, asthma risk decreases as the similarity of their home bacterial microbiota composition to that of farm homes increases. The protective microbiota had a low abundance of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and total bacterial load and was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings in a study among rural German children2 and showed that children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased asthma risk. The indoor dust microbiota composition appears to be a definable, reproducible predictor of asthma risk and a potential modifiable target for asthma prevention.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Gut microbiome of virally-infected C57BL/6 mice,"Chronic viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus or Hepatitis C Virus currently afflict hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Some chronic viruses are able to colonize mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), which act as barrier tissues that allow selective interaction of the host’s mucosal immune system with environmental factors such as microbiota, food antigens or pathogens. Gut mucosal alterations are associated with highly inflammatory conditions and diseases including obesity and autism. Although numerous correlative studies associate specific GI tract microbial species with immune parameters and health of HIV-infected individuals, mechanistic studies establishing a causal relationship between certain components of the microbiota, the anti-viral immune response, host resistance and tolerance to the infection are lacking. Here we propose to combine high- throughput microbiological techniques with immunological approaches in order to gain functional understanding on the impact of the intestinal microbiota in gut health and overall anti-viral immunity in a well-established mouse model of chronic viral infection. By doing so, we will contribute to the basic understanding on how hosts can adapt to life-long coexistence with persistent pathogens and the implications for host health

Rapid change of fecal microbiome and disappearance of Clostridium difficile in a colonized infant after transition from breast milk to cow milk,"Background
Clostridium difficile is the most common known cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Upon the disturbance of gut microbiota by antibiotics, C. difficile establishes growth and releases toxins A and B, which cause tissue damage in the host. The symptoms of C. difficile infection disease range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Interestingly, 10–50 % of infants are asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile. This longitudinal study of the C. difficile colonization in an infant revealed the dynamics of C. difficile presence in gut microbiota.

Methods
Fifty fecal samples, collected weekly between 5.5 and 17 months of age from a female infant who was an asymptomatic carrier of C. difficile, were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results
Colonization switching between toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. difficile strains as well as more than 100,000-fold fluctuations of C. difficile counts were observed. C. difficile toxins were detected during the testing period in some infant stool samples, but the infant never had diarrhea. Although fecal microbiota was stable during breast feeding, a dramatic and permanent change of microbiota composition was observed within 5 days of the transition from human milk to cow milk. A rapid decline and eventual disappearance of C. difficile coincided with weaning at 12.5 months. An increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Parabacteroides spp., Coprococcus spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Oscillospira spp. and a decrease of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Escherichia spp., and Clostridium spp. were observed during weaning. The change in microbiome composition was accompanied by a gradual increase of fecal pH from 5.5 to 7.

Conclusions
The bacterial groups that are less abundant in early infancy, and that increase in relative abundance after weaning, likely are responsible for the expulsion of C. difficile.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Developmental biology', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Regulation of Plasma/Urine Gut Microbiome Metabolite Levels By Kidney Organic Anion Transporters (OATs),"Many gut microbiome-derived metabolites (eg. indoxyl sulfate and other indole-derivatives, kynurenine, phenyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, CMPF, propionate and other short chain fatty acids) are organic anions.

Intergenerational transfer of antibiotic-perturbed microbiota enhances colitis in susceptible hosts,"Antibiotics have long-lasting consequences on the gut microbiota with the potential to impact host physiology and health. Antibiotic exposure has been associated with increased IBD risk- notable since antibiotics are massively used worldwide. Antibiotic use is extensive during pregnancy, however, little is known about the transgenerational impact of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. Because of the potential importance of intergenerational microbiota transmission, we hypothesized that a maternally inherited antibiotic-perturbed microbiota affects the risk of experimental colitis in offspring. Here we demonstrate that adult pregnant mice inoculated with a gut microbial community shaped by antibiotic exposure transmitted their perturbed microbiota to their offspring with high fidelity. Without any direct or continued exposure to antibiotics, this dysbiotic microbiota in the offspring remained distinct from controls for at least 21 weeks. By using both IL-10-deficient mice and wild type mice, we showed that both inoculum and genotype shape the microbiota populations in the offspring. Because IL10-/- mice are genetically susceptible to colitis, we could assess the risk due to maternal transmission of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota.  We found that the IL10-/- offspring that had received the perturbed gut microbiota had markedly increased risk of colitis. Taken together, our findings indicate that antibiotic exposure shaping the maternal gut microbiota has effects that extend to their offspring with both ecological and long-term disease consequences.

Analysis of 4,866 samples identified 143 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) whose variation in relative abundances across the samples was significantly regulated by plant genotype, and included five of seven core OTUs present in all samples. Plant genetic effects were significant amid the large effects of plant age on the rhizosphere microbiome, regardless of the specific community of each field, and despite microbiome responses to climate events. Seasonal patterns showed that the plant root microbiome is locally seeded, changes with plant growth, and responds to weather events.

A vegetable fermentation facility hosts distinct microbiomes reflecting the production environment ,"Fermented vegetables are highly popular internationally in part due to their enhanced nutritional properties, cultural history, and desirable sensorial properties. In some instances, fermented foods provide a rich source of the beneficial microbial communities that could promote gastrointestinal health. The indigenous microbiota that  colonize fermentation facilities may impact food quality, food safety, spoilage risks, and  maintain the nutritive value of the product. Here, microbiomes within sauerkraut  production facilities were profiled to characterize variance across surfaces and to  determine the sources of these bacteria. Accordingly, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with whole genome shotgun analysis to explore biogeographical patterns of microbial diversity and assembly within the  production facility. Our results indicate that raw cabbage and vegetable handling  surfaces exhibit more similar microbiomes relative to the fermentation room, processing area, and dry storage surfaces. We identified biomarker bacterial phyla and families that  are likely to originate from the raw cabbage and vegetable handling surfaces. Raw cabbage was identified as the main source of bacteria to seed the facility with human handling contributing a minor source of inoculation. Leuconostoc and Lactobacillaceae dominated all surfaces where spontaneous fermentation occurs, as these taxa are associated with the process. Wall, floor, ceilings, and barrel surfaces host unique  microbial signatures. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are  widely distributed within the production facility and these communities assemble non randomly dependent on the surface type.

Formula diet ,"Background The gut microbiota of breast-fed and formula-fed infants differ significantly, as do the risks for allergies, gut dysfunction and upper respiratory tract infections.  The connections between breast milk, various formulas, and the profiles of gut bacteria to these childhood illnesses, as well as the mechanisms underlying the effects, are not well understood. 
Methods We investigated distal colon microbiome by 16S RNA amplicon sequencing, morphology by histomorphometry, immune response by cytokine expression and tryptophan metabolism in a pig model in which piglets were sow-fed, or fed soy or dairy milk-based formula from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 21. 
Results Formula feeding significantly (p<0.05) altered the colon microbiome relative to the sow feeding. A significant reduction in microbial diversity was noted with formula groups in comparison to sow-fed. Streptococcus, Blautia, Citrobacter, Butrycimonas, Parabacteroides, Lactococcus genera were increased with formula feeding relative to sow feeding. In addition, relative to sow feeding, Anaerotruncus, Akkermansia, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, Christensenella, Holdemania were increased in milk-fed piglets, and Biliophila, Ruminococcus, Clostridium were increased in soy fed piglets. No significant gut morphological changes were noted. However, higher cytokine mRNA expression (BMP4, CCL11, CCL21) was observed in the distal colon of formula groups. Formula feeding reduced enterochromaffin cell number and serotonin, but increased tryptamine levels relative to sow feeding. 
Conclusion Our data confirm that formula diet alters the colon microbiome and appears to shift tryptophan metabolism from serotonin to tryptamine, which may lead to greater histamine levels and risk of allergies in infants.

Effects of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Increased Weight on Metabolomic and Microbiome Profiles in the Pediatric Population,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the major type of childhood diabetes. In the last few decades, the prevalence of T1D has increased dramatically, particularly in children under 5 years of age. The rapid rise of T1D incidence coincidently follows the same trend as the outbreak of obesity, especially in developed countries. Indeed, epidemiological studies have revealed a strong association between obesity and the risk of T1D. Nearly 40% of pediatric T1D patients ages 2 to 18 years in the U.S. are obese or overweight. Excessive weight puts these children at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death for T1D. However, we still lack the appropriate criteria to diagnose and treat these patients in order to prevent early morbidity and mortality.

Depression in HIV and HCV Co-Infected Individuals is Associated with Systematic Differences in the Gut Microbiome and Metabolome,"Depression is influenced by the structure, diversity, and composition of the gut microbiome. Although depression has been described previously in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C (HCV) mono-infections, and to a lesser extent HIV-HCV coinfection, research on the interplay between depression and the gut microbiome in these disease states is limited. Here, we characterized the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from 373 participants who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment, and the gut metabolome on a subset of these participants using untargeted metabolomics with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We observed that the gut microbiome and metabolome were distinct between HIV positive and negative individuals. HCV infection had a large association with the microbiome that was not confounded by drug use. Therefore, we classified the participants by HIV and HCV infection status (HIV-monoinfected, HIV-HCV coinfected, or uninfected). The three groups significantly differed in their gut microbiome (unweighted UniFrac distances) and metabolome (Bray Curtis distances). Coinfected individuals also had lower alpha diversity. Within each of the three groups, we evaluated lifetime Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and current Beck Depression Inventory II. We found that the gut microbiome differed between depression states only in coinfected individuals. Coinfected individuals with a lifetime history of MDD were enriched in primary and secondary bile acids, as well as taxa previously identified in people with MDD. Collectively, we observe persistent signatures associated with depression only in coinfected individuals, suggesting that HCV itself, or interactions between HCV and HIV, may drive HIV-related neuropsychiatric differences.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Paroxetine administration in mice affects bile acid levels,"Recent interest in the role of microbiota in health and disease has implicated gut
microbiota dysbiosis in psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder.
Several antidepressant drugs that belong to the class of Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors have been found to display antimicrobial activities. In fact, one of the first
antidepressants discovered serendipitously in the 1950s, the monoamine-oxidase
inhibitor Iproniazid, was a drug used for the treatment of tuberculosis. In the current
study we chronically treated DBA/2J mice for two weeks with Paroxetine, a Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, and collected fecal pellets as a proxy for the gut

swim test revealed significant differences between Paroxetine- and vehicle-treated
mice. No significant alterations were found in the fecal taxa compositions of the
animals. However, untargeted mass spectrometry profiling of fecal pellet extracts
showed several primary and secondary bile acid level differences between Paroxetine-

important signaling activities and have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) markedly increases tissue oxygen delivery. Case series suggest it may have a potential therapeutic benefit in ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the therapeutic potential of HBOT as an adjunct to steroids for UC flares requiring hospitalization.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease which significantly affects the lives of nearly 1 million Americans. It is estimated that 25% of patients will need hospitalization for acute moderate to severe flares. Although colectomy is curative, it can be associated with significant morbidity, mortality and a reduction in quality of life. The mainstay of medical therapy for these patients is high dose intravenous steroids but approximately one-third of patients will be refractory and require second line rescue therapy with either cyclosporine or Infliximab, both of which are associated with a lack of significant efficacy in maintaining remission over the long term. Furthermore, corticosteroids have considerable long-term consequences and these immune suppressive drugs are associated with life-threatening infections and lymphomas. In an attempt to address this gap, we investigated the potential application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an adjunct to standard medical treatment. In a small phase 2A pilot study of 18 hospitalized UC patients, we were able to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in response, remission, and trend towards significance for avoidance of colectomy. We are now preparing for a phase 2B study in anticipation of a phase 3 registration trial and a multi-PI R01

Copolymers enhance selective bacterial community colonization for potential root zone applications,"Managing the impact of anthropogenic and climate induced stress on plant growth remains a challenge. Here we show that polymeric hydrogels, which maintain their hydrous state, can be designed to exploit functional interactions with soil microorganisms. This microbial enhancement may mitigate biotic and abiotic stresses limiting productivity. The presence of mannan chains within synthetic polyacrylic acid (PAA) enhanced the dynamics and selectivity of bacterial ingress in model microbial systems and soil microcosms. Pseudomonas fluorescens exhibiting high mannan binding adhesins showed higher ingress and localised microcolonies throughout the polymeric network. In contrast, ingress of Bacillus subtilis, lacking adhesins, was unaltered by mannan showing motility comparable to bulk liquids. Incubation within microcosms of an agricultural soil yielded hydrogel populations significantly increased from the corresponding soil. Bacterial diversity was markedly higher in mannan containing hydrogels compared to both control polymer and soil, indicating enhanced selectivity towards microbial families that contain plant beneficial species. Here we propose functional polymers applied to the potential root zone which can positively influence rhizobacteria colonization and potentially plant growth as a new approach to stress tolerance.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Agricultural science'}",set()

C-section born mice gained 33% more body mass post-weaning than did their vaginally born counterparts.

Temperature-phased conversion of acid whey waste into medium-chain carboxylic acids via lactic acid: no external e-donor.,"Waste streams can be renewable feedstocks to produce biofuels and chemicals. Acid whey is an example waste stream and is produced by the Greek-yogurt industry in large volumes. This whey and other waste streams have been successfully converted into methane gas by anaerobic digesters with open cultures of microbial consortia (microbiomes). However, the revenue from methane has been relatively low. Until now, no other products could be produced with microbiomes from this waste stream. This has now changed. Here, we showed that acid whey was converted into valuable medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs), such as n-caproic acid (n-hexanoic acid) and n-caprylic acid (n-octanoic acid), without addition of external electron acceptors. MCCAs can be precursors for biofuels or chemicals or can be used as green antimicrobials or livestock feed additives. Due to biological chain elongation, the oil-like MCCAs were extracted with relatively low energy consumption. However, capital costs should be further reduced during scale-up.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Chemistry', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biochemistry'}",set()
Higher substrate ratios of ethanol to acetate steered chain elongation toward n-caprylate in a bioreactor with product extraction,"Anaerobic reactor microbiomes are capable of converting organic wastes to medium chain carboxylates via a process termed reverse beta-oxidation. Generally, an electron-rich substrate, such as one containing ethanol or lactic acid, is used to drive the chain elongation of shorter chain carboxylates, such as acetate and n-butyrate, to longer chain carboxylates, such as n-caproate or n-caprylate. Recent research has looked at coupling syngas fermentation, which produces principally ethanol and some acetate, to chain-elongation bioreactors to upgrade the produced ethanol to n-caproate or n-caprylate.  Here, we examined the effect of different ethanol-to-acetate substrate ratios on the production of medium chain carboxylates. Higher ethanol-to-acetate substrate ratios led to higher selectivity for n-caprylate. The highest n-caprylate selectivity in this study occurred when the substrate contained primarily ethanol (ethanol-to-acetate ratio > 200, on a COD basis), however, a large fraction of the fed ethanol was not consumed and was wasted in the effluent. At an approximately one-to-one substrate COD ratio, n-caprylate production stopped in the bioreactor. The experimental results in this study generally backed up the predictions of a generalized thermodynamic model we developed to predict the thermodynamic feasibility of n-caprylate production at different ethanol-to-acetate ratios. Finally, Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bioreactor microbiome across time and in two sampling locations on the bioreactor revealed a relatively uneven microbiome that was dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla members.

Comparative analyses of vertebrate gut microbiomes reveal convergence between birds and bats,"Diet and host phylogeny drive the taxonomic and functional content of the gut microbiome in mammals, yet it is unknown whether these patterns hold across all vertebrate lineages. Here we assess gut microbiomes from ~900 vertebrate species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, assessing contributions of diet, phylogeny, and physiology to structuring gut microbiomes. In most non-flying mammals, strong correlations exist between microbial community similarity, host diet, and host phylogenetic distance up to the host order level. In birds, by contrast, gut microbiomes are only very weakly correlated to diet or host phylogeny. Furthermore, while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts, most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity. Notably, among the mammals, bats host especially bird-like gut microbiomes, with little evidence for correlation to host diet or phylogeny. Thus suggests that host-gut microbiome phylosymbiosis depends on factors convergently absent in birds and bats, potentially associated with physiological adaptations to flight. Our findings expose major variations in the behavior of these important symbioses in endothermic vertebrates, and may signal fundamental evolutionary shifts in the costs/benefit framework of the gut microbiome.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Physiology', 'Biology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Thermoplasmatales and methanogens: Potential association with the crenarchaeol production in Chinese soils,"Crenarchaeol is a unique isoprenoid glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (iGDGT) lipid, which is only identified in cultures of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota. However, the taxonomic origins of crenarchaeol have been debated recently. The archaeal populations, other than Thaumarchaeota, may have associations with the production of crenarchaeol in ecosystems characterized by non-thaumarchaeotal microorganisms. To this end, we investigated 47 surface soils from upland and wetland soils and rice fields and another three surface sediments from river banks. The goal was to examine the archaeal community compositions in comparison with patterns of iGDGTs in four fractional forms (intact polar-, core-, monoglycosidic- and diglycosidic-lipid fractions) along gradients of environments. The DistLM analysis identified that Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota were mainly responsible for changes in crenarchaeol in the overall soil samples; however, Thermoplasmatales may also contribute to the change in crenarchaeol. This is further supported by the comparison of crenarchaeol between samples characterized by methanogens, Thermoplasmatales or Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota, which suggests that the former two may contribute to the crenarchaeol pool. Last, when samples containing enhanced abundance of Thermoplasmatales and methanogens were considered, crenarchaeol was observed to correlate positively with Thermoplasmatales and archaeol, respectively. Collectively, our data suggest that the crenarchaeol production is mainly derived from Thaumarchaeota and partly associated with uncultured representatives of Thermoplasmatales and archaeol-producing methanogens in soil environments that may be in favor of their growth. Our finding supports the notion that Thaumarchaeota may not be the sole source of crenarchaeol in the natural environment, which may have implication for the evolution of lipid synthesis among different types of archaea.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Association of Body Mass Index with Fecal Microbial Diversity and Metabolites in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort,"Obesity is an established risk factor for multiple cancer types. Lower microbial richness has been linked to obesity, but human studies are inconsistent, and associations of early-life body mass index (BMI) with the fecal microbiome and metabolome are unknown.

Methods:
We characterized the fecal microbiome (n = 563) and metabolome (n = 340) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. We estimated associations of adult BMI and BMI history with microbial features and metabolites using linear regression and Spearman correlations (rs) and computed correlations between bacterial sequence variants and metabolites overall and by BMI category.

Results:
Microbial richness, including the number of sequence variants (rs = −0.21, P < 0.0001), decreased with increasing adult BMI but was not independently associated with BMI history. Adult BMI was associated with 56 metabolites but no bacterial genera. Significant correlations were observed between microbes in 5 bacterial phyla, including 18 bacterial genera, and metabolites in 49 of the 62 metabolic pathways evaluated. The genera with the strongest correlations with relative metabolite levels (positively and negatively) were Blautia, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus in the Firmicutes phylum, but associations varied by adult BMI category.

Evolutionary trends in host physiology outweigh dietary niche in structuring primate gut ,"A major theme in microbiome research is the strong effect of host diet on the composition and function of the gut microbiota. To this end, several studies have reported that hosts with similar evolutionary diet trends share key gut microbial traits that may facilitate the digestion of certain food resources. However, these studies rely heavily on samples from captive individuals and confound host phylogeny and gut morphology with diet. To more effectively test the impact of host evolutionary diet trends on the gut microbiota, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, comparing the gut microbiota of 18 species of wild non-human primates classified as either folivores or closely-related non-folivores, evenly distributed throughout the primate Order and representing a range of gut morphological specializations. While folivory does result in some convergent microbial traits, collectively we show that the influence of host phylogeny on both gut microbial composition and function is much stronger than that of diet. Our findings indicate that the gut microbiota is strongly constrained by evolutionary trends in host physiology and that its response to diet may be less dynamic than frequently described. More care must be taken to consider bidirectional interactions between host physiology and the gut microbiota when designing and interpreting microbiome studies, and common assumptions that specific host-gut microbe interactions can be extrapolated across a range of host species must be re-evaluated.

caprylate reactors,"Chain-elongation microbiomes can be used to convert ethanol- or lactic-rich organic wastes to medium chain carboxylic acids.

Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metaproteomics were used to characterize the bioreactor microbiomes during the operating period. In the bioreactors, despite similar imposed operating conditions, we observed different microbial communities and different n-caprylate productivities. In the bioreactor with the lowest n-caprylate conversion efficiency, relatively high hydrogen partial pressures were observed. Subsequent sparging of nitrogen gas reduced the hydrogen partial pressure in that bioreactor and resulted in a higher n-caprylate conversion efficiency. However, across all the bioreactors a common relationship between hydrogen partial pressures and n-caprylate conversion efficiency was not found. An Oscillospira OTU in the family Ruminococcaceae dominated in the bioreactor with the highest n-caprylate specificities and productivities.

Multi-omic analysis of cider indigenous-fermentations,"Indigenous fermentation of food products is a time-honored method for food preservation and transformation. Although such fermentations, which depend upon indigenous microorganisms, are a source of concern both with regard to apparent health risks and general squeamishness of contemporary populations, mankind has relied on these methods for millennia to provide safe food and beverages. This results from the fact that these processes involve microbial communities that are self-assembling and, in part, self-limiting. Harnessing these methods has resulted in some of our most prized food and, especially, beverages including beer, wine and fruit ciders. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms governing self-assembly and reproducibility of the product. This is not only interesting and important with regard to food science and culinary arts but also has profound implications into understanding the assembly and maintenance of complex microbial communities from those in the environment to the human gut microbiome. Because these processes are, to some extent, stereotypical within a given ecosystem, understanding the diversity of microorganisms, their interactions and their in uence on and response to changing environmental conditions is critical. We propose to study the indigenous fermentation of apple cider, a beverage with historical importance and rapidly developing popularity and economic impact, as a model microbial ecosystem. We intend to characterize the evolution of the microbial population in the context of such fermentations and to understand the influence of those organisms on each other and the environment.

Oral microbiome composition has been shown to be associated with age, oral health, diet, and geography, although, data resembling the natural variation found in the general public is still lacking. In this study, a citizen-scientist model was used to obtain crowdsourced bacterial composition data from guests at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science to explore previously published oral microbiome interactions within a variable, general population. We found bacterial composition to be more diverse in youth microbiomes when compared to adults. Adult oral microbiomes were predominantly impacted by oral health habits, while youth microbiomes were impacted by sex and weight status. The oral pathogen Treponema was detected more commonly in adults without recent dentist visits and in obese youth. Additionally, oral microbiomes from members of the same family were more similar to each other than to oral microbiomes from non-related individuals. These results show that previously reported oral microbiome associations are observable in a population containing the natural variation commonly found in the general public.

Gut bacteria from multiple sclerosis patients modulate human T cells and exacerbate symptoms in mouse models.,"An essential function of gut microbiota is regulating immune responses, including T lymphocyte functions in health and disease. We hypothesized that gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system characterized by significant involvement of T lymphocytes. We analyzed the microbiome of stool samples from treatment-naïve MS patients and healthy controls using amplicon sequencing of 16S V4 region. Although we did not observe major global shifts in microbial community structure, we were able to identify individual microbial taxa that were significantly associated with MS and study their functions on regulating primary human T lymphocyte differentiation in vitro. First, we discovered that MS patients exhibited less Treg differentiation in response to their own microbiota. Furthermore, MS-associated bacteria Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was sufficient to reduce Treg differentiation and increase Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte differentiation. The expansion of Th1 lymphocytes was recapitulated by Akkermansia muciniphila, which was similarly more abundant in MS patients. In contrast, Parabacteroides distasonis, which was significantly reduced in MS microbiome, stimulated T lymphocyte differentiation into a CD25+ IL-10+ regulatory phenotype. Our results suggest that MS-associated changes in microbiota alter T lymphocyte differentiation in a complex fashion and likely through multiple mechanisms.

Microbiota Accessible Carbohydrates Suppress Clostridium difficile Infection in a Murine Model,"Clostridium difficile (Cd) is an opportunistic diarrheal pathogen and Cd infection (CDI) represents a major healthcare concern, causing an estimated 15,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Several enteric pathogens, including Cd, leverage inflammation and the accompanying microbial dysbiosis to thrive in the distal gut. Although diet is among the most powerful available tools for affecting the health of humans and their relationship with their microbiota, investigation into the effects of diet on CDI has been limited. Here, we show in mice that the consumption of microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary plant polysaccharides has a significant impact on CDI. Specifically, using a model of antibiotic-induced CDI that typically resolves within 12 days of infection, we demonstrate that MAC-deficient diets perpetuate CDI. We show that Cd burdens are suppressed through the addition of either a diet containing a complex mixture of MACs or a simplified diet containing inulin as the sole MAC source. We show that switches between these dietary conditions are coincident with changes to microbiota membership, its metabolic output and Cd-mediated inflammation. Together, our data demonstrate the outgrowth of MAC-utilizing taxa and the associated end products of MAC metabolism, namely the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are associated with decreased Cd fitness despite increased Cd toxin expression in the gut.

The effect of legume supplementation on the gut microbiota in rural Malawian infants aged 6 to 12 months,"Interventions to decrease the burden of childhood malnutrition are urgently needed, as millions of children die annually owing to undernutrition and hundreds of millions more are left cognitively and physically stunted. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a pervasive chronic subclinical inflammatory condition among children that develops when complementary foods are introduced, places them at high risk of stunting, malabsorption, and poor oral vaccine efficacy. Improved interventions to reduce the burden of EED and stunting are expected to markedly improve the nutritional status and survival of children throughout resource-limited settings. We conducted two prospective randomized controlled clinical trials to determine whether common beans or cowpeas improve growth, ameliorate EED, and alter the intestinal microbiome during a high-risk period in the lives of rural Malawian children.

High-Throughput Miniaturized 16S rRNA Amplicon Library Preparation Reduces Costs while Preserving Microbiome Integrity,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled many advances across biology, with microbial ecology benefiting primarily through expanded sample sizes. Although the cost of running sequencing instruments has decreased substantially over time, the price of library preparation methods has largely remained unchanged. In this study, we developed a low-cost miniaturized (5-µl volume) high-throughput (384-sample) amplicon library preparation method with the Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler. Our method reduces costs of library preparation to $1.42 per sample, a 58% reduction compared to existing automated methods and a 21-fold reduction from commercial kits, without compromising sequencing success or distorting the microbial community composition analysis. We further validated the optimized method by sampling five body sites from 46 Pacific chub mackerel fish caught across 16 sampling events over seven months from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier in La Jolla, CA. Fish microbiome samples were processed with the miniaturized 5-µl reaction volume with 0.2 µl of genomic DNA (gDNA) and the standard 25-µl reaction volume with 1 µl of gDNA. Between the two methods, alpha diversity was highly correlated (R2 > 0.95), while distances of technical replicates were much lower than within-body-site variation (P < 0.0001), further validating the method. The cost savings of implementing the miniaturized library preparation (going from triplicate 25-µl reactions to triplicate 5-µl reactions) are large enough to cover a MiSeq sequencing run for 768 samples while preserving accurate microbiome measurements.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Acoustics'}",set()
Enhancing untargeted metabolomics using metadata-based source annotation,"We've all heard the old adage you are what you eat-but, do we know what we eat? There is much we don't yet know about the precise composition of the foods we eat; for example, which different molecules and microbes are found in or on different foods? How does the manner in which you prepare the foods change the molecules that are present? How much do organic foods differ from all natural or conventionally grown foods?
The Global FoodOmics project will address these questions, and many more. The Global FoodOmics project will characterize the molecules and microbes present on a diverse set of foods and beverage- from fruits, vegetables, spices, to complex foods, exotic animal feed, pet food and more. Other categories that will be represented are fermented foods such as yogurt, pickled vegetables and beverages including beer, wine, kombucha as well as sodas and juices. Human untargeted metabolomics studies annotate only ~10% of molecular features. We introduce reference-data-driven analysis to match metabolomics tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data against metadata-annotated source data as a pseudo-MS/MS reference library. Applying this approach to food source data, we show that it increases MS/MS spectral usage 5.1-fold over conventional structural MS/MS library matches and allows empirical assessment of dietary patterns from untargeted data.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Metabolomics', 'Omics'}",set()

Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases,"Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affect several million individuals worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation.

Cheese rind communities provide tractable systems for in situ and in vitro studies of microbial diversity,Tractable microbial communities are needed to bridge the gap between observations of patterns of microbial diversity and mechanisms that can explain these patterns. We developed cheese rinds as model microbial communities by characterizing in situ patterns of diversity and by developing an in vitro system for community reconstruction. Sequencing of 137 different rind communities across 10 countries revealed 24 widely distributed and culturable genera of bacteria and fungi as dominant community members. Reproducible community types formed independent of geographic location of production. Intensive temporal sampling demonstrated that assembly of these communities is highly reproducible. Patterns of community composition and succession observed in situ can be recapitulated in a simple in vitro system. Widespread positive and negative interactions were identified between bacterial and fungal community members.

Coprolites reveal ecological interactions lost with the extinction of New Zealand birds,"Over the past 50,000 years, biotic extinctions and declines have left a legacy of vacant niches and broken ecological interactions across global terrestrial ecosystems. Reconstructing the natural, unmodified ecosystems that preceded these events relies on high-resolution analyses of palaeoecological deposits. Coprolites are a source of uniquely detailed information about trophic interactions and the behaviours, gut parasite communities and microbiotas of prehistoric animal species. Such insights are critical for understanding the legacy effects of extinctions on ecosystems, and can help guide contemporary conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of ancient eukaryotic DNA from coprolites to reconstruct aspects of the biology and ecology of four species of extinct moa and the critically endangered kakapo parrot from New Zealand (NZ). Importantly, we provide the first evidence that moa and prehistoric kakapo consumed ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting these birds played a role in dispersing fungi key to NZ’s natural forest ecosystems. We also provide the first DNA-based evidence that moa frequently supplemented their broad diets with ferns and mosses. Finally, we also find parasite taxa that reveal insights into moa behaviour, and present new data supporting the hypothesis of co-extinction between moa and several parasite species. Our study demonstrates that HTS sequencing of coprolites provides a powerful tool for resolving key aspects of ancient ecosystems, and can rapidly provide insights not obtainable by yet is considerably more efficient and requires less specialist expertise than conventional palaeoecological techniques, such as fossil analyses",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Paleogenomics', 'Zoology', 'Ecology'}",set()
Gut microbiota utilize immunoglobulin A for mucosal colonization,"While it is known that many strains of bacteria persist for years within individuals, mechanisms that govern the steady-state stability of the gut microbiome remain poorly understood. We have discovered a sensor/regulatory system in the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis that modulates remodeling of its surface architecture to invite binding of immunoglobulin A (IgA), which promotes formation of bacterial aggregates in mucus and adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. Generation of IgA that binds the surface of B. fragilis is required for bacteria to occupy a defined mucosal niche that mediates stable colonization of the gut. Therefore, in addition to its role in pathogen clearance, we found that IgA responses are co-opted by the microbiome to enable host-microbial symbiosis. We have designed a sequencing experiment to test our theory with a full mouse microbiome using gnotobiotic wildtype and IgA knockout mice.

Gastrointestinal Surgery for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Persistently Lowers Microbiome and Metabolome Diversity,"Background
Many studies have investigated the role of the microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but few have focused on surgery specifically or its consequences on the metabolome that may differ by surgery type and require longitudinal sampling. Our objective was to characterize and contrast microbiome and metabolome changes after different surgeries for IBD, including ileocolonic resection and colectomy.

Methods
The UC San Diego IBD Biobank was used to prospectively collect 332 stool samples from 129 subjects (50 ulcerative colitis; 79 Crohn’s disease). Of these, 21 with Crohn’s disease had ileocolonic resections, and 17 had colectomies. We used shotgun metagenomics and untargeted liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics to characterize the microbiomes and metabolomes of these patients up to 24 months after the initial sampling.

Results
The species diversity and metabolite diversity both differed significantly among groups (species diversity: Mann-Whitney U test P value = 7.8e-17; metabolomics, P-value = 0.0043). Escherichia coli in particular expanded dramatically in relative abundance in subjects undergoing surgery. The species profile was better able to classify subjects according to surgery status than the metabolite profile (average precision 0.80 vs 0.68).

Conclusions
Intestinal surgeries seem to reduce the diversity of the gut microbiome and metabolome in IBD patients, and these changes may persist. Surgery also further destabilizes the microbiome (but not the metabolome) over time, even relative to the previously established instability in the microbiome of IBD patients. These long-term effects and their consequences for health outcomes need to be studied in prospective longitudinal trials linked to microbiome-involved phenotypes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia reproducibly change the gut microbiome and metabolome across model systems,"Studying perturbations in the gut ecosystem using animal models of disease continues to provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in various physiological conditions. However, understanding which of these changes are consistent across different animal models, and hence potentially translatable to human populations remains a major unmet challenge in the field. Nonetheless, in relatively limited cases have the same interventions been studied in two animal models in the same laboratory. Moreover, such studies typically examine only one data layer and one-time point. Here we show the power of integrating microbiome (measured by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and metabolome (measured by untargeted LC-MS/MS) data over time in identifying features that relate two different mouse models of atherosclerosis: ApoE and Ldlr knockouts (ApoE-/-; Ldlr-/-), under conditions of intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH), a model for human obstructive sleep apnea. Using Random Forest classifiers trained on each data layer, we show excellent accuracy values in predicting IHH-exposure within ApoE and Ldlr knockout models, and in cross-applying predictive features found in one animal model to the other.  Some of the key microbes and metabolites that were top predictors of IHH-exposure across animal models included bacterial species from the order Clostridiales, alpha-muricholic acid (bile acid) and vaccenic acid (fatty acid), providing a refined set of biomarkers reproducibly associated with this intervention. The results highlight that different animal models of disease can be related to one another using supervised machine learning techniques, especially when time series multi-omics data are available and provide a pathway towards identifying robust microbiome and metabolome features that underpin translation from animal models to understanding human disease.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Metaomics Reveals Microbiome Based Proteolysis as a Driver of Ulcerative Colitis Severity,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is driven by disturbed host-microbiota relations, but current treatments exclusively target host inflammatory pathways. To understand how host-microbiota interactions go awry in UC, we collected and analyzed six fecal or serum based –omic datasets from 40 UC patient samples displaying varying clinical, endoscopic, and histologic disease activity. A validation cohort of 210 samples (73 UC, 117 Crohn’s disease (CD), 20 healthy controls) was collected and analyzed separately and independently. Data integration across both cohorts showed that a subset of the clinically active UC patients had an over-abundance of proteases that originated from the bacterium, Bacteroides vulgatus. To test the hypothesis that B. vulgatus proteases contribute to UC disease activity, we first profiled B. vulgatus proteases and then selected an appropriate broad-spectrum protease inhibitor to evaluate their involvement in colitis models. Protease inhibition improved B. vulgatus-induced barrier dysfunction in vitro, and prevented colitis in B. vulgatus IL10 deficient monocolonized mice. Furthermore, transplantation of feces from UC patients with over-abundant B. vulgatus proteases into germ-free mice induced colitis dependent on protease activity. Together, these results stemming from a multi-omics approach, improve understanding of functional alterations in microbiota that drive UC and suggest inhibition of B. vulgatus proteases as a novel strategy to treat this disease.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome,"Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut1 but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()

The effect of treatment with the helminth product Tuftsin-phosphorylcholine (TPC) on the microbiome of mice with active lupus,"The hygiene hypothesis claims that lack of exposure to microorganisms in developed countries, correlates with increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. It was also found that helminths are able to modulate the immune response in hosts in order to survive. Consequently, several successful trials using helminths as a treatment for autoimmune diseases have been reported. The helminth derivative, phosphorylcholine (PC), was demonstrated to have immunomodulatory properties. We have recently shown in a murine model that when a conjugate of Tuftsin and PC, termed TPC, is prophylactically administered before the onset of glomerulonephritis, it attenuates the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The current study aimed to examine the effect of TPC on the gut microbiome in a mouse model of lupus. TPC treatment altered the gut composition in the mice with active lupus, in correlation with a significant decrease in glomerulonephritis, followed by an increased level of anti-inflammatory IL-10, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as expansion of the T regulatory cell population. Importantly, we found that TPC treatment altered the microbiome composition in the mouse gut, in correlation with a significant decrease in protein secretion and improved disease parameters. The major effect of TPC treatment on the genera in the gut microbiome included increased abundance of Odoribacter and decreased abundance of Akkermansia. Overall, our results suggest involvement of the microbiome in the immunomodulation of glomerulonephritis in lupus mice. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()

Those who relocate from Latin America to the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon index of alpha diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to the USA in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of the Latino population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Ruminococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2 (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with both obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and Anaerotruncus show paradoxical associations with both obesity and late-life introduction to the USA.

Fecal microbiota composition drives immune activation in HIV-infected individuals,"The inflammatory properties of the enteric microbiota of HIV-infected individuals are of considerable interest because of strong evidence that bacterial translocation contributes to chronic immune activation and disease progression. Altered enteric microbiota composition occurs with HIV infection but whether altered microbiota composition or increased intestinal permeability alone drives peripheral immune activation is controversial. To comprehensively assess the inflammatory properties of HIV-associated enteric microbiota and relate these to systemic immune activation, we developed methods to purify whole fecal bacterial communities (FBCs) from stool for use in in vitro immune stimulation assays with human cells. We show that the enteric microbiota of untreated HIV-infected subjects induce significantly higher levels of activated monocytes and T cells compared to seronegative subjects. FBCs from anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-infected individuals induced intermediate T cell activation, indicating an only partial correction of adaptive immune cell activation capacity of the microbiome with ART. In vitro activation levels correlated with activation levels and viral load in blood and were particularly high in individuals harboring specific gram-positive opportunistic pathogens. Blockade experiments implicated TNF-α and Toll-Like Receptor-2 (TLR2), which recognizes peptidoglycan, as strong mediators of T cell activation; This may contradict a previous focus on lipopolysaccharide as a primary mediator of chronic immune activation. These data support that increased inflammatory properties of the enteric microbiota and not increased permeability alone drives chronic inflammation in HIV.

We reasoned that the gut microbiome may play an important role in PTLDS given that the symptoms overlap considerably with conditions in which a dysbiotic microbiome has been observed, including mood, cognition, and autoimmune disorders. Analysis of sequencing data from a rigorously curated cohort of PTLDS patients revealed a gut microbiome signature distinct from healthy control subjects, as well as from ICU patients being treated with antibiotics.

The greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was accompanied by increased muscle expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism and angiogenesis (secondary outcomes) in the Diet+EX group. There were no differences between groups in plasma branched-chain amino acids or markers of inflammation, and both interventions caused similar changes in the gut microbiome.

"Temporal, environmental, and biological drivers of the mucosal microbiome in a wild marine fish, Scomber japonicus","Changing ocean conditions driven by anthropogenic activity may have a negative impact on fisheries by increasing stress and disease with the mucosal microbiome as a potentially important intermediate role. To understand how environment and host biology drives mucosal microbiomes in a marine fish, we surveyed five body sites (gill, skin, digesta, GI, and pyloric caeca) from 229 Pacific chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, collected across 38 time points spanning one year from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier, making this the largest and longest wild marine fish microbiome survey. Mucosal sites had unique communities significantly different from the surrounding sea water and sediment communities with over 10 times more diversity than sea water alone. Although, external surfaces such as skin and gill were more similar to sea water, digesta was similar to sediment.

"The Fecal, Oral, and Skin Microbiota of Children with Chagas Disease treated with Benznidazole","Background
Chagas disease is still prevalent in rural areas of South America. In endemic areas of Bolivia, school children are screened for the program of Chagas eradication of the Ministry of Health, and positive children are treated. Here we compared the fecal, oral and skin microbiomes of children with or without Chagas disease, and before and after eradication treatment of infected children. 
Methods
A total of 543 Bolivian children (5-14 years old) were tested for Chagas disease, and 20 positive children were treated with Benznidazole.  Fecal samples and oral and skin swabs were obtained before and after treatment, together with samples from a group of 35 uninfected controls. The 16SrRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed using Qiime to determine alpha diversity differences and community distances, and linear discriminatory analyses to determine discriminatory taxa by infection status or treatment.
Results
Of 543 children, 20 tested positive for Chagas, and were included in the study together with 35 control children that were negative for Chagas. Fecal samples, oral and skin swabs were taken at the beginning of the study and after the anti-protozoa therapy with Benznidazole to the Chagasic children. Chagas was present in 3.7% of the children screened. Infected children had higher fecal Firmicutes -Streptococcus, Roseburia, Butyrivibrio, and Blautia-, and lower Bacteroides and also showed some skin -but not oral- microbiota differences. Treatment eliminated the fecal microbiota differences from control children, increasing Dialister (class Clostridia) and members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and decreasing Prevotella and Coprococcus, with minor effects on the oral and skin bacterial diversity. 
Conclusions
The results of this study show that there are differences in the fecal microbiota associated with Chagas infection in children, and that treatment normalizes fecal microbiota (makes is more similar to that in controls), but is associated with oral and skin microbiota differences from control children. Since microbiota impacts in children can lead to It is important to determine the effect of drugs on the children microbiota, since impacts could lead to physiological effects, and might be avoidable with microbiota restoration interventions.

Commensal Enterobacteriaceae protect against Salmonella colonization by competing for oxygen,"Neonatal chicks are highly susceptible to colonization with Salmonella enterica serovar (S.) Enteritidis, but the underlying mechanism is not fully resolved. We show that neonatal colonization with S. Enteritidis required a virulence factor-dependent increase in epithelial oxygenation, which drove expansion of the pathogen in the lumen of the chick intestine by aerobic respiration. Co-infection experiments with an Escherichia coli strain carrying an oxygen-sensitive reporter suggested that S. Enteritidis competes with commensal Enterobacteriaceae for oxygen. Association with either spore-forming bacteria or commensal Enterobacteriaceae from adult chicken microbiota did not protect germ-free mice from S. Enteritidis colonization. However, a combination of Enterobacteriaceae and spore-forming bacteria conferred colonization resistance against S. Enteritidis at levels similar to those observed in germ-free mice associated with adult chicken microbiota. Combining spore-forming bacteria with a single avian E. coli isolate protected germ-free mice from pathogen colonization, but protection was lost when the ability to respire oxygen under microaerophilic conditions was genetically ablated in E. coli. These results show that commensal Enterobacteriaceae contribute to colonization resistance by competing with S. Enteritidis for oxygen, a resource critical for pathogen expansion.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Longitudinal assessment of the influence of lifestyle homogenization on the microbiome in a cohort of United States Air Force Cadets,"Abstract
Background: Humans spend much of their lives in the built environment, yet researchers are just starting to understand the underlying processes and consequences of the bidirectional exchange of microbial communities among occupants, as well as between occupants and their built environments. The ability to detect these exchanges is not trival, due to several confounding factors that govern the life and habits of the occupants including, for instance, diet as well as ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, among others. Additionally, studies of the occupants and/or of the built environment need to consider the inherent temporal variability of the microbial communities. Here, we present a study of United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Cadets (n = 34), in which we examined the bacterial microbiomes from: 1) skin and gut samples among roommate pairs, 2) four built environment samples from inside the pairs’ dormitory rooms, and 3) four built environment samples from shared spaces in the dormitory. The Cadets were sampled longitudinally over one semester (5 months), starting after the summer break, when they moved into the dormitory with a roommate they had not lived with previously. 
Results: After quality filtering, the study contained 2,170 bacterial samples (21,866 unique sub-operational taxonomic units; sOTUs). The bacterial skin microbiome of cohabitating Cadets became more similar over time (ANOSIM, R = 0.231, panosim < 0.002). Linear convergence of skin microbial communities was also seen between the occupants and the dormitory surfaces that were considered individualized to a particular roommate (i.e., desk; ANOSIM R = 0.312, panosim < 0.05). In addition, microbial sharing between two Cadet roommate’s skin and the common area (i.e. shared floor space between the two Cadet’s beds) was evident (ANOSIM R = 0.406, panosim < 0.03). The gut-to-gut microbiome comparisons of cohabitating Cadets showed convergence overtime, the post-break gut profiles did not show significant change for roommates. Additionally, in squadrons with large shared places, the gut samples did show significant sharing of bacterial microbiomes with bathroom handle samples over the duration of time. Moreover, the gut bacterial microbiome was more predictive of occupant identity than the skin microbiome through random forest models. 
Conclusions: The shared ecosystem dynamics of this study enabled us to better understand how factors can influence the homogenization of bacterial microbiome of occupants and the built environment. These results show that cohabitation and indoor exposures associated with the built environment can significantly influence our microbiota directly. Whereas skin bacterial microbiome sharing was readily apparent,  gut microbiome homogenization appeared to require longer periods of time; thereby suggesting that the latter is a more stable system.

How to count our microbes,"Recently Vandeputte et al. introduced the concept of Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP) as a way to bypass many of the statistical and interpretative challenges that arise from the compositional structure of microbiome sequencing data.
Although their proposed solution looks promising and elegantly accounts for the compositionality nature of the conventional Relative Microbiome Profiling (RMP) data, it could theoretically introduce new bias when samples contain a significant amount of free extracellular prokaryotic DNA. This free DNA is captured during the sequencing but is excluded by flow-cytometry cell count. In case the taxonomic composition of free circulating DNA differs from the composition of intact microbial cells (e.g. due to differences in susceptibility of microbial cells to environmental exposures), this might result into the introduction of a new source of bias in downstream analysis.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioinformatics', 'Computational biology', 'Microbiology'}",set()

The Reestablishment of Microbial Communities after Surface Cleaning in Schools,"Bacteria EBI Accession number: PRJEB23735
Fungi EBI Accession number: PRJEB23736

Aims. The goal of this study was to quantify the indoor microbiome dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities on school desk surfaces during a cleaning intervention.
Methods and Results. Quantitative PCR and DNA sequenced-based approaches were employed to describe microbial community dynamics on ten desk surfaces, spread across three schools, located in the Northeast region of the U.S. Six samples were taken from each desk, one pre-cleaning, and five post-cleaning at 30 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 21 days. Cleaning of the desks physically removed ~50% of bacteria, fungi, and human cells and a full recovery of the surface microbial concentrations occurred within 2-5 days. This recovery period is much shorter than the schools’ once per semester cleaning schedule. The dominant source of bacteria and fungi on desks at all time points came from the human microbiome (skin, oral cavity, and gut). More than 50% fungi on desks were members of genera that contain known allergens.
Conclusions. Microbial communities on these school desks are primarily generated and maintained from the deposition of human-associated bacteria and fungi. Current school surface cleaning protocols and cycles may be ineffective at reducing student exposure to fungal allergens and microbes of human origin.
Significance and Impact of Study. Multiple students often share desks in schools.

Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests as alterations in complex human behaviors including social communication and stereotypies. In addition to genetic risks, the gut microbiome differs between typically-developing (TD) and ASD individuals, though it remains unclear whether the microbiome contributes to symptoms. We transplanted gut microbiota from human donors with ASD and TD controls into germ-free mice, and reveal that colonization with ASD microbiota was sufficient to induce hallmark autistic behaviors. The brains of mice colonized with ASD microbiota display alternative splicing of ASD-relevant genes. Microbiome and metabolome profiles of mice harboring human microbiota predict that specific bacterial taxa and their metabolites modulate ASD behaviors. Indeed, treatment of an ASD mouse model with candidate microbial metabolites improves behavioral abnormalities and affects neuronal excitability in the brain. We propose that the gut microbiome modulates behaviors in mice via production of neuroactive metabolites, suggesting that gut-brain connections contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD.

Here we present a comprehensive survey of dipteran and haemosporidian parasites, and characterization of the gut, oral, and skin microbiota of Afrotropical bats. We found significant correlation between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as links between the oral microbiome and malarial parasitism, suggesting a potential mechanism for host selection and vector-borne disease transmission in bats. Mirroring recent studies of host-microbiome co-speciation in mammals, we find a weak correlation between chiropteran phylogenetic distances and bacterial community dissimilarity across the three anatomical sites, suggesting that host environment is more important than shared ancestry in shaping the composition of associated bacterial communities.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
"Influence of Intermittent Hypoxia/Hypercapnia on Atherosclerosis, Gut Microbiome, and Metabolome","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common sleep disorder characterized by intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHC), increases atherosclerosis risk. However, the contribution of intermittent hypoxia (IH) or intermittent hypercapnia (IC) in promoting atherosclerosis remains unclear. Since gut microbiota and metabolites have been implicated in atherosclerosis, we examined whether IH or IC alters the microbiome and metabolome to induce a pro-atherosclerotic state. Apolipoprotein E deficient mice (ApoE-/- ), treated with IH or IC on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks, were compared to Air controls. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined, gut microbiome was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolome was assessed by untargeted mass spectrometry. In the aorta, IC-induced atherosclerosis was significantly greater than IH and Air controls (aorta, IC 11.1 ± 0.7% vs. IH 7.6 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05 vs. Air 8.1 ± 0.8%, p < 0.05). In the pulmonary artery (PA), however, IH, IC, and Air were significantly different from each other in atherosclerotic formation with the largest lesion observed under IH (PA, IH 40.9 ± 2.0% vs. IC 20.1 ± 2.6% vs. Air 12.2 ± 1.5%, p < 0.05). The most differentially abundant microbial families (p < 0.001) were Peptostreptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae. The most differentially abundant metabolites (p < 0.001) were tauro-β-muricholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and lysophosphoethanolamine (18:0). We conclude that IH and IC (a) modulate atherosclerosis progression differently in distinct vascular beds with IC, unlike IH, facilitating atherosclerosis in both aorta and PA and (b) promote an atherosclerotic luminal gut environment that is more evident in IH than IC. We speculate that the resulting changes in the gut metabolome and microbiome interact differently with distinct vascular beds.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Immunology', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Fecal microbiota dysbiosis in macaques and humans within a shared environment ,"Traditional zoonotic disease research focuses on detection of recognized pathogens and may miss opportunities to understand broader microbial transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and the environment. We studied human-macaque microbiome overlap in Kosum Phisai District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand, where a growing population of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Kosumpee Forest Park interact with humans from an adjacent village. We surveyed workers in or near the park with elevated exposure to macaques to characterize tasks resulting in exposure to macaque feces in addition to dietary and lifestyle factors that influence gut microbiome composition. Fecal samples were collected from 12 exposed workers and 6 controls without macaque exposure, as well as 8 macaques from Kosumpee Forest Park and 4 from an isolated forest patch with minimal human contact. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal sample extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to characterize the microbial community. A permuted betadisper test on the weighted UniFrac distances revealed significant differences in the dispersion patterns of gut microbiota from exposed and control macaques (p = 0.03). The high variance in gut microbiota composition of macaques in contact with humans has potential implications for gut microbiome stability and susceptibility to disease, described by the Anna Karenina principle (AKP). Human samples had homogenous variance in beta diversity but different spatial medians between groups (p = 0.02), indicating a shift in microbial composition that may be explained by fundamental lifestyle differences between the groups unrelated to exposure status. SourceTracker was used to estimate the percent of gut taxa in exposed humans that was contributed by macaques. While one worker showed evidence of elevated contribution, the overall trend was not significant. Task observations among workers revealed opportunities to employ protective measures or training to reduce exposure to occupational hazards. These results suggest the potential for hygiene measures to mitigate negative aspects of contact between humans and macaques in order to optimize the health of both populations.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

Here we utilized a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design in 7 cohorts of juvenile male C57BL/6NCrl mice (N = 112) to determine if immunization with M. vaccae is an effective countermeasure in a murine model of chronic circadian disruption (CDR) and psychosocial stress using the social defeat (SD) test.

Changes in the gut microbiota of urban subjects during an immersion in the traditional diet and lifestyle of a rainforest village,"People living traditional lifestyles have higher gut microbiota diversity than urban subjects. We hypothesized that shifting lifestyles from an urban to a traditional rainforest village would lead to changes in the microbiota of visitors that would become more similar to the microbiota of villagers. Here, we characterized at different time points, the microbiota of 7 urban visitors (5 adults and 2 children) staying in a rainforest Amerindian village for 16 days, and compared them with reference collection of samples from age-matched local villagers. We performed a 16S rRNA gene survey in multiple body sites (fecal, oral, nasal and skin) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The main factor segregating the microbiotas of each body site was human group (i.e. visitors vs. villagers), with the visitor microbiota tending to have lower alpha diversity; the lowered alpha diversity was statistically significant in the microbiota of skin, and in the children’s fecal and oral microbiota. During the rainforest period, all visitors experienced microbiota changes within their personal cloud of variation. For all body sites, the microbiota conformations in visitor children better matched those in villagers of the same age, than did the microbiota of visitor adults, which showed lower “microbiota age” as compared to villagers.

Natural history of the infant gut microbiome and impact of antibiotic treatment on bacterial strain diversity and stability,"The goal of the DIABIMMUNE antibiotics cohort is to study the effect of repeated antibiotic treatments on the developing infant gut microbiome. 

Despite widespread use of antibiotics in children, the effect of antibiotic exposure on the developing infant gut microbiome has remained underexplored. Yassour et al. present a longitudinal study capturing how the gut microbiome responds to and recovers from antibiotic perturbations. Antibiotic-treated children had less stable and less diverse communities. Antibiotic resistance genes within the guts of these children peaked after antibiotic treatment but generally returned rapidly to baseline. Delivery mode (vaginal versus Caesarian) also had strong long-term effects on microbial diversity. These data give insight into the consequences of early life factors such as birth mode and antibiotic treatment.

Abstract
The gut microbial community is dynamic during the first three years of life, before stabilizing to an adult-like state. However, little is known about the impact of environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. Here, we report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, approximately half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first three years of life. Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by Cesarean section and approximately 20% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first six to eighteen months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains.  In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of dense longitudinal studies with high-resolution strain profiles for studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology'}",set()
The human microbiome correlates with risk factors for cardiometabolic disease across an epidemiologic transition,"Oral and fecal microbial biomarkers have previously been associated with cardiometabolic (CM) risk, however, no comprehensive attempt has been made to explore this association in minority populations or across different geographic regions. We characterized gut- and oral-associated microbiota and CM risk in 655 participants of African-origin, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, and the United States (US). CM risk was classified using the CM risk cut-points for elevated waist circumference, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and elevated triglycerides. Gut-associated bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose. Similarly, gut bacterial beta diversity was also significantly differentiated by waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceridemia and HDL-cholesterolemia. Notably, differences in inter- and intra-personal gut microbial diversity were geographic-region specific. Participants meeting the cut-points for 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors were significantly more enriched with Lachnospiraceae, and were significantly depleted of Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Prevotella. The predicted relative proportions of the genes involved in the pathways for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and butyrate synthesis were also significantly differentiated by the CM risk phenotype, whereby genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine, glutarate and 4-aminobutyrate/succinate pathways and LPS synthesis pathway were enriched in participants with greater CM risk. Furthermore, inter-individual oral microbiota diversity was also significantly associated with the CM risk factors, and oral-associated Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella were enriched in participants with 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors. We demonstrate that in a diverse cohort of African-origin adults, CM risk is significantly associated with reduced microbial diversity, and the enrichment of specific bacterial taxa and predicted functional traits in both gut and oral environments. As well as providing new insights into the associations between the gut and oral microbiota and CM risk, this study also highlights the potential for novel therapeutic discoveries which target the oral and gut microbiota in CM risk.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology'}",set()

Establishing microbial composition measurement standards with reference frames,"Approaches to differential abundance analysis have been controversial across the microbiome sciences. The current gold standard requires laborious measurements of total biomass to accurately determine shifts in microbial abundance among samples. Here, we highlight the pitfalls of comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total biomass. In an oral time series experiment, these methods alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell count normalized data. Further, these methods identify differentially abundant microbes previously undetectable with standard methods in two independent published atopic dermatitis datasets. These methods therefore allow re-assessment of published relative abundance data to reveal previously undetectable microbiome changes without the need for new molecular assays.

We have optimized a novel strategy for quantifying the number of live microbial cells in human saliva and will assess how this changes throughout the course of a day and compares among healthy individuals. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we can assess the impact magnitude of daily lifestyle events (e.g. brushing teeth, eating meals, etc.) on the microbial taxa present in human saliva. Using our absolute abundance data from flow cytometry we can validate novel multinomial regression analyses developed in the Knight lab that can account for these effects and show that we are able to produce the same results from both raw and cell count-normalized data. Previous work has shown that untargeted metabolomics of blood is highly affected by fasting versus feeding.

Quantifying live microbial load in human saliva samples over time reveals stable composition and dynamic load,"Background: 
Human saliva contains a distinct and rich community of microorganisms. While the microbial composition of saliva has been documented, the number of microorganisms present in saliva and how this number changes over time remains unclear. Furthermore, the viability of these microorganisms over time is also unknown. Here we present a novel method to characterize live microbial load in parallel with microbiome sequencing. We apply this method to unstimulated saliva samples collected in two distinct experiments; one collected longitudinally throughout the entire course of an ordinary day and the other collected across an acute perturbation.
Results:
We found that salivary flow rate is inversely correlated with microbial load. The number of microorganisms in saliva changed by orders of magnitude throughout the day, highlighting the importance of using computational tools that account for the inherent compositional nature of microbiome sequencing data. Removing relic DNA with PMA treatment improved resolution across longitudinally collected samples. A decrease in microbial load following alcohol-free mouthwash use was only detectable following PMA treatment. Despite large fluctuations in microbial load, we found that saliva microbial composition is remarkably stable and highly host-specific.  
Conclusions:
The results of this analysis provide novel insight about the salivary microbiome, will help inform the design and analysis of future saliva microbiome studies, and together provide a community resource that will be useful for studies benchmarking new computational tools for the analysis of compositional datasets.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Data integration and warehousing'}",set()

Notably, a Prevotella-rich enterotype described in HIV-infected populations is now understood to be common in men who have sex with men (MSM) regardless of HIV status, but driving factors and potential health implications are unknown. Here we further define the MSM-associated gut microbiome and describe compositional differences between the fecal microbiomes of Prevotella-rich MSM and non-MSM that may underlie observed pro-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, we show relatively subtle gut microbiome changes in HIV infection in MSM and women that include an increase in potential pathogens that is ameliorated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lastly, using a longitudinal cohort, we describe microbiome changes that happen after ART initiation. This study provides an in-depth characterization of microbiome differences that occur in a US population infected with HIV and demonstrates the degree to which these differences may be driven by lifestyle factors, ART and HIV infection itself. Understanding microbiome compositions that occur with sexual behaviors that are high-risk for acquiring HIV and untreated and ART treated HIV infection will guide the investigation of immune and metabolic functional implications to ultimately target the microbiome therapeutically.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Staphylococcus Seed Grant Project,"Staphylococcus aureus is gram-positive bacterial pathogen capable of asymptomatically colonizing about a third of the world population. This pathogen is the most common cause of nosocomial infections and a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. The ability of S. aureus to colonize several environments is due to the presence of a variety of virulence factors that facilitate attachment, colonization, cell-cell interactions, tissue damage, dissemination through the body, and immune evasion. S. aureus infection is a frequent problem encountered by patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD), with bacterial colonization observed on both lesional and nonlesional skin. AD, commonly known as eczema, is a complex disease. Its progression and severity depend on genetic risk factors (e.g. loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin), altered microbiota, and exposure to allergens. Another important factor, often neglected, is the effect of skin colonization by different strains of S. aureus, with distinct metabolic capability and pathogenicity. Although various S. aureus genomes are currently available in public repositories, the lack of information about the original source of isolation (AD skin, respiratory tract), patient clinical data, and the difficulty into obtaining available bacterial isolates, complicates strain characterization and AD contextualization. However, to accurately understand how interactions are established with the host and other bacteria and to develop targeted interventions, it is crucial to discriminate between different strains. We propose a comprehensive study to better characterize S. aureus strains from healthy people and patients with atopic dermatitis.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Dermatology'}",set()
Microbiota regulate intestinal absorption and metabolism of fatty acids in the zebrafish,"The intestinal microbiota is known to impact host nutrition and energy balance. However, its role in dietary fat absorption in the intestine is unclear. Here, we use in vivo imaging of fluorescent fatty acid (FA) analogs delivered into gnotobiotic zebrafish to reveal that the microbiota stimulates FA uptake and lipid droplet (LD) formation in the intestinal epithelium. Comparison of animals that were starved or fed a sterile diet reveals that the microbiota promotes epithelial LD number, but not size, in a diet-dependent manner. The presence of food results in Firmicutes enrichment in the microbiota of the zebrafish intestine, but not in the surrounding water. Monoassociation studies reveal that LD number is increased by diet-enriched Firmicutes and LD size is increased by other bacterial types. These results indicate that members of the gut microbiota regulate intestinal FA absorption via distinct mechanisms and that diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota membership might indirectly influence FA absorption.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Biology'}",set()

We characterized the microbiota from the anterior descending intestine, the medial intestine (these two comprise the small intestine) and the posterior descending intestine (or large intestine), using pyrosequencing to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We compared animals in their natural marine environment and in sea-water aquaria.

Shifts in the microbial community composition and associated changes in the secondary metabolites of marine sediments contribute to declining reef health,"We hypothesize that shifts in the microbial community composition and the associated change in secondary metabolites of marine sediments is playing a role in declining reef health. For us to properly test our hypothesis, we require paired microbiome and metabolomic data. The microbiome data will help us establish changes in the microbial communities across algal to coral-dominant reefs. Additionally, through mining for biosynthetic gene clusters associated with the production of natural products, we can genomically assess changes in the metabolic potential of sediment communities. The metabolomic samples will then allow us to profile the sediment metabolome and establish connections between the microbial producers, their biosynthetic gene clusters and ultimately the secondary metabolite products we detect in the environment.

Evaluating Metagenomic Prediction of the Metaproteome in a 4.5 Year Study of a Crohns Patient,"Although genetic approaches are the standard in microbiome analysis, proteome-level information is largely absent. This discrepancy warrants a better understanding of the relationship between gene copy number and protein abundance, as this is crucial information for inferring protein level changes from metagenomic data. As it remains unknown how metaproteomic systems evolve during dynamic disease states, we leveraged a 4.5-year fecal time series of a single patient with colonic Crohn’s disease. Utilizing multiplexed quantitative proteomics and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we quantified over 29,000 protein groups and 110,000 genes and compare them to five protein biomarkers of disease activity. Results indicate that many broad-scale observations were consistent between data types, including overall clustering by Principal Coordinates Analysis and fluctuations in Gene Ontology terms related to Crohn’s disease. Through linear regression, we determined genes and proteins fluctuating in conjunction with inflammatory metrics. We discovered many conserved taxonomic differences relevant to Crohn’s disease including a negative association of Faecalibacterium and a positive association of Escherichia to Calprotectin. Despite concordant genera associations, the specific genes correlated with these metrics were drastically different between metagenomic and metaproteomic datasets. This resulted in the generation of unique functional interpretations dependent on the data type, and metaproteome data provided new evidence for previously investigated mechanisms of dysbiosis.  One such example was a connection between urease enzymes, amino acid metabolism and local inflammation. This proof-of-concept approach prompts further investigation of the metaproteome and its relations to the metagenome in biologically complex systems such as the microbiome.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteomics'}",set()
Is there convergence of gut microbes in blood-feeding vertebrates?,"Animal microbiomes play an important role in dietary adaptation, yet the extent to which microbiome changes exhibit parallel evolution is unclear. Of particular interest is adaptation to extreme diets, such as blood, which poses special challenges in its content of proteins and lack of essential nutrients. In this study, we assessed taxonomic signatures (by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and potential functional signatures (inferred by PICRUSt) of hematophagy in three classes of vertebrates: birds, bats, and fish. We also compare the results to microbiome data from hematophagous arthropods. Our goal was to test three alternative hypotheses: no convergence of microbiomes, convergence in taxonomy, and convergence in function. We find a statistically significant effect of hematophagy in terms of microbial taxonomic convergence, although this effect is small compared to the differences found between hematophagous and non-hematophagous species within the different host clades. We also found a small effect of convergence at the predicted functional level, although it is possible that the lack of metagenomic data and the poor representation of microbial lineages adapted to hematophagy in genome databases limited the power of this approach. The results provide a paradigm for exploring convergent microbiome evolution replicated with independent contrasts in multiple host lineages.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Zoology', 'Animal study'}",set()

Gut microbiome transition across a lifestyle gradient in Himalaya,"The composition of the gut microbiome in industrialized populations differs from those living traditional lifestyles. However, it has been difficult to separate the contributions of human genetic and geographic factors from lifestyle. Whether shifts away from the foraging lifestyle that characterizes much of humanity’s past influence the gut microbiome, and to what degree, remains unclear. Here, we characterize the stool bacterial composition of four Himalayan populations to investigate how the gut community changes in response to shifts in traditional human lifestyles. These groups led seminomadic hunting-gathering lifestyles until transitioning to varying levels of agricultural dependence upon farming. The Tharu began farming 250-300 years ago, the Raute and Raji transitioned 30-40 years ago, and the Chepang retain many aspects of a foraging lifestyle. We assess the contributions of dietary and environmental factors on their gut-associated microbes and find that differences in the lifestyles of Himalayan foragers and farmers are strongly correlated with microbial community variation. Furthermore, the gut microbiomes of all four traditional Himalayan populations are distinct from that of the Americans, indicating that industrialization may further exacerbate differences in the gut community. The Chepang foragers harbor elevated abundance of taxa associated with foragers around the world. Conversely, the gut microbiomes of the populations that have transitioned to farming are more similar to those of Americans, with agricultural dependence and several associated lifestyle and environmental factors correlating with the extent of microbiome divergence from the foraging population. The gut microbiomes of Raute and Raji reveal an intermediate state between the Chepang and Tharu, indicating that divergence from a stereotypical foraging microbiome can occur within a single generation. Our results also show that environmental factors such as drinking water source and solid cooking fuel are significantly associated with the gut microbiome. Despite the pronounced differences in gut bacterial composition across populations, we found little differences in alpha diversity across lifestyles. These findings in genetically similar populations living in the same geographical region establish the key role of lifestyle in determining human gut microbiome composition and point to the next challenging steps of determining how large-scale gut microbiome reconfiguration impacts human biology.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Microbial and Metabolic Succession on Common Building Materials Under High Humidity Conditions,"Despite considerable efforts to characterize the ecology of bacteria and fungi in the built environment (BE), the metabolic mechanisms underpinning their colonization and successional dynamics remain unclear. Here, we applied bacterial/viral particle counting, qPCR, 16S and ITS rRNA amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics to longitudinally characterize the ecological dynamics of four commonly used building materials maintained at high humidity conditions (~94% RH). We varied the natural inoculum provided to each material by placing them in different occupied spaces, and we wet the surface of half of the samples of each material to simulate a flooding event. As expected, different materials showed different bacterial and viral particle abundance, with wet materials having higher growth rates and lower alpha diversity compared to non-wetted materials. Wetting described the majority of the variance in bacterial, fungal and metabolite structure, and material type only influenced bacterial and metabolic diversity, while location of inoculation was only weakly associated with bacterial and fungal beta diversity. Metabolites indicative of microbial activity were identified, as were those that were native to the surface material. Glucose-phosphate was abundant on all materials (except mold-free gypsum) and was correlated with Enterobacteriaceae, which could indicate a potential bacterial nutrient source. A compound consistent with scopoletin, a plant metabolite with antimicrobial activity, was significantly negatively correlated with Bacillus and positively correlated with Pseudomonas and enriched in medium density fiberboard (MDF) materials. In wet samples, the alkaloids nigragillin and fumigaclavine C, both with antimicrobial properties, were significantly positively correlated with the fungal phylum Ascomycota. Nigragillin, was also negatively correlated with Bacillus and Pseudomonas abundance. Thiabendazole and azoxystrobin (anti-fungal compounds) were highly abundant on mold-resistant gypsum wallboard and likely directly influenced the decreased fungal growth observed on this material. The mold-resistant gypsum material also showed a significant increase in bacterial alpha diversity, and bacterial and viral particle abundance, as well as a decrease in metabolite diversity, likely a result of reduced fungal growth. Penicillium taxa were positively correlated with thiabendazole, which suggested the persistence of resistant strains. Also, specific to the wet samples, Bacillus abundance was positively correlated with the azoxystrobin, suggesting bi-directional competitive adaptation, and positively correlated with metabolites known to interfere with Pseudomonas biofilm formation, which could explain the anti-correlation between these taxa. As expected, high moisture conditions enabled faster growth of inoculating microorganisms, whose composition, chemistry, and competition was shaped by surface material, suggesting that both fungal and bacterial growth need to be considered when determining the impact of dampness in built environments.

UKD_pax5_prj2,"Precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL), the most common type of childhood leukemia, is frequently characterized by the cooperation of a genetic predisposition acquired in utero and secondary oncogenic events taking place only in a fraction of predisposed children after birth. Although predisposition can be detected at birth, it is currently unknown which factors determine the development of overt leukemia in genetic carriers and how this can be potentially prevented. Experimental studies have shown that infectious stimuli promote disease onset in genetically predisposed mice. Here, we analyzed the impact of the microbiome on leukemogenesis in a mouse model (Pax5+/- mice) that faithfully mimicks genetic predisposition and leukemogenesis of human pB-ALL related to the synergy of genetic predisposition and exposure to a natural infectious environment to analyze the impact of the microbiome on leukemogenesis. Employing 16S rRNA sequencing and machine learning we can accurately predict a distinct gut microbiome which is determined by a specific constitutional genetic variant. Deprivation of the gut microbiome by antibiotic treatment enhanced pB-ALL development in Pax5+/- predisposed (63% vs. 22%) but not in wildtype mice (0%). This finding was observed in the presence but also -to a lesser extent- in the absence of a natural, infectious environment (39%). The composition of the gut microbiome constitutes a biomarker signature and allows to identify specifically those Pax5+/- mice that later on developed leukemia. This indicates that the gut microbiome can be used to identify carriers at risk to develop leukemia and to reduce this risk by early-life interventions.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Omics'}",set()
A Different Suite: The Assemblage of Distinct Fungal Communities in Water-Damaged Units of a Poorly-Maintained Public Housing Building,"Water-damaged housing has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, principally respiratory disease and asthma. Much of what we know about fungi associated with water-damaged buildings has come from culture-based and immunochemical methods. Few studies have used high-throughput sequencing technologies to assess the impact of water-damage on microbial communities in residential buildings. In this study we used amplicon sequencing and quantitative-PCR to evaluate fungal communities on surfaces and in airborne dust in multiple units of a condemned public housing project located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
We recruited 21 households to participate in this study and characterized their apartments as either a unit with visible mold or no visible mold. We sampled airborne fungi from dust settled over a month-long time period from the outdoors, in units with no visible mold, and units with visible mold. In units with visible mold we additionally sampled the visible fungal colonies from bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms.
We found that fungal biomass in settled dust was greater outdoors compared to indoors, but there was no significant difference of fungal biomass in units with visible mold and no visible mold. Interestingly, we found that fungal diversity was reduced in units with visible mold compared to units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold harbored fungal communities distinct from units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold had a greater abundance of taxa within the classes Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Wallemiomycetes. Colonies of fungi collected from units with visible mold were dominated by two Cladosporium species, C. sphaerospermum and C halotolerans. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing of fungi indoors can be a useful strategy for identifying housing units that have experienced water damage, particularly when compared to the composition of outdoor fungal communities.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Environmental sciences', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular biology'}",set()
Metagenomics reveals sediment microbial community response to Deepwater Horizon oil spill,"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a deep-sea hydrocarbon plume that caused a shift in the indigenous microbial community composition with unknown ecological consequences. Early in the spill history, a bloom of uncultured, thus uncharacterized, members of the Oceanospirillales was previously detected, but their role in oil disposition was unknown. Here our aim was to determine the functional role of the Oceanospirillales and other active members of the indigenous microbial community using deep sequencing of community DNA and RNA, as well as single-cell genomics. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing revealed that genes for motility, chemotaxis and aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation were significantly enriched and expressed in the hydrocarbon plume samples compared with uncontaminated seawater collected from plume depth. In contrast, although genes coding for degradation of more recalcitrant compounds, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were identified in the metagenomes, they were expressed at low levels, or not at all based on analysis of the metatranscriptomes. Isolation and sequencing of two Oceanospirillales single cells revealed that both cells possessed genes coding for n-alkane and cycloalkane degradation. Specifically, the near-complete pathway for cyclohexane oxidation in the Oceanospirillales single cells was elucidated and supported by both metagenome and metatranscriptome data. The draft genome also included genes for chemotaxis, motility and nutrient acquisition strategies that were also identified in the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. These data point towards a rapid response of members of the Oceanospirillales to aliphatic hydrocarbons in the deep sea.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Gut microbiota is associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease in a population in the midst of Westernization,"Westernization and its accompanying epidemiological transitions are associated with changes in gut microbiota. While the extremes of this lifestyle spectrum have been compared (hunter-gatherers, industrialized countries), populations undergoing such shifts have received little attention. To fill the gap of knowledge about the microbiome evolution following broad lifestyle changes and the emergence of disease-associated dysbiosis, we performed a cross-sectional study in which we characterized the microbiota of 441 Colombian adults through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and determined its relationship with demographic, health-related and dietary parameters. We showed that in the gut microbiota of this cohort thrive taxa proper of both hunter-gatherers (Prevotella, Treponema) and citizens of industrialized countries (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Barnesiella); the relative abundances of these taxa differed from those in Western and non-Western populations. We also showed that the Colombian gut microbiota is composed of five consortia of co-abundant microorganisms that are differentially associated with lifestyle, obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and highlighted metabolic pathways that might explain associations between microbiota and host health. Our results give insights into the evolution of the gut microbiota, and underscore the importance of this community to human health. Promoting the growth of specific microbial consortia could help ameliorating physiological conditions associated with Western lifestyles.

Phylogenetic stratigraphy in the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat,"The microbial mats of Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico - GN historically were considered a simple environment, dominated by cyanobacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Culture-independent rRNA community profiling instead revealed these microbial mats as among the most phylogenetically diverse environments known.  A preliminary molecular survey of the GN mat based on only approximately 1500 small subunit rRNA gene sequences discovered several new phylum-level groups in the bacterial phylogenetic domain and many previously undetected lower-level taxa.  We determined an additional approximately119,000 nearly full-length sequences and 28,000 -smaller than 200 nucleotide 454 reads from a ten-layer depth profile of the GN mat. With this unprecedented coverage of long sequences from one environment we confirm the mat is phylogenetically stratified, presumably corresponding to light and geochemical gradients throughout the depth of the mat. Previous shotgun metagenomic data from the same depth profile show the same stratified pattern and suggest that metagenome properties may be predictable from rRNA gene sequences.  We verify previously identified novel lineages and identify new phylogenetic diversity at lower taxonomic levels, for example, thousands of operational taxonomic units at the family-genus levels differ considerably from known sequences. The new sequences populate parts of the bacterial phylogenetic tree that previously were poorly described, but indicate that any comprehensive survey of GN diversity has only begun. Finally, we show that taxonomic conclusions are generally congruent between Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies, with the taxonomic resolution achieved dependent on the abundance of reference sequences in the relevant region of the rRNA tree of life.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Phylogenetics'}",set()
Successional Dynamics and Seascape-Level Patterns of Microbial Communities on the Canopy-Forming Kelps Nereocystis luetkeana and Macrocystis pyrifera,"Canopy-forming kelps create underwater forests that are among the most productive marine ecosystems. On the Pacific coast of North America, two canopy-forming kelps with contrasting life histories co-occur; Macrocystis pyrifera, a perennial species, and Nereocystis luetkeana, an annual species. Kelp blade-associated microbes were sampled from 12 locations across a spatial gradient in Washington, USA, from the outer Pacific Coast to Puget Sound. Microbial communities were characterized using next-generation Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. At higher taxonomic levels (bacterial phylum and class), canopy-forming kelps hosted remarkably similar microbial communities, but at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level, microbial communities on M. pyrifera and N. luetkeana were host-specific and distinct from free-living bacteria in the surrounding seawater. Microbial communities associated with blades of each kelp species displayed significant geographic variation. The microbiome of N. luetkeana changed along the spatial gradient and was significantly correlated to salinity, with outer Pacific coast sites enriched in Bacteroidetes (family Saprospiraceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Granulosicoccus sp.), and southern Puget Sound sites enriched in Alphaproteobacteria (family Hyphomonadaceae). We also examined microbial community development and succession on meristematic and apical N. luetkeana blade tissues throughout the summer growing season on Tatoosh Island, WA. Across all dates, microbial communities were less diverse on younger, meristematic blade tissue compared to the older, apical tissues. In addition, phylogenetic relatedness among microbial taxa increased from meristematic to apical blade tissues, suggesting that the addition of microbial taxa to the community was a non-random process that selected for certain phylogenetic groups of microbes. Microbial communities on older, apical tissues displayed significant temporal variation throughout the summer and microbial taxa that were differentially abundant over time displayed clear patterns of community succession. Overall, we report that host species identity, geographic location, and blade tissue age shape the microbial communities on canopy-forming kelps.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Correlating probiotic dietary supplements during pregnancy with maternal microbiome profiles.,"Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) refers to a delivery that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation due to either preterm labor (PTL), preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), or cervical insufficiency. In the United States, the preterm birth rate is ~10%. Since prematurity is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term disability, the prevention of preterm birth is a significant public health concern.

There is growing evidence that the maternal microbiota, particularly the vaginal microbiota, may have a significant impact on pregnancy and postnatal outcomes. There are a number of recent microbiome studies that have identified distinct vaginal microbiota that may place a patient at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as sPTB, as well as distinct vaginal microbiota that may have a protective effect. By identifying these “good” and “bad” microbiomes, there is the potential for advancements in the prevention of sPTB, particularly therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting protective bacteria. However, before we can develop therapeutic interventions, we must study the effect of potential interventions on the pregnant microbiome.

There is evidence to show that certain oral probiotic preparations can influence the vaginal flora in a non-pregnant population, but this has not been studied in pregnant patients. Recent studies have proposed a variety of probiotic preparations that, when used in pregnancy, could decrease the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as sPTB. However, these studies did not specifically investigate the maternal microbiome.

Utilizing microbiome and bioinformatic tools to reduce energy use and food waste in poultry,"Poultry is a massive and growing industry with substantial energy costs, partly due to rapid
cooling necessary to preserve meat quality and shelf-life. In the United States, water chilling
(WC) is commonly employed, although air chilling (AC) requires almost 50 times less gross
energy. There is a knowledge gap about the holistic effects of WC vs AC on poultry meat
products that likely inhibits the poultry industry from adopting AC, which is widely used in
Europe. Measuring product quality and shelf-life can be challenging and expensive. We propose
here a novel approach to this aspect of poultry science - to utilize microbiome tools to
characterize poultry microbial ecology during processing through to retail display, and determine
how it relates to quality, shelf-life, and nutritive status. Our goals are two-fold. We will provide a
comprehensive assessment of the effects of WC vs AC on poultry quality, including nutritive
value, shelf-life, and microbial ecology. Secondly, we will provide the industry with a novel
microbiome tool for inexpensively, and accurately characterizing the microbial communities
associated with meat, which we suspect are predictive of quality, shelf-life and nutritive status.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Agricultural science'}",set()
Microbiome recovery following colorectal surgery and antibiotic exposure in mice is dependent on diet and has a major influence on anastomotic healing: a longitudinal 16S rRNA analysis,"Background: Previous work has indicated that major compositional and functional changes in the colon microbiota develop following removal of segment of the colon (resection) and its reconnection (anastomosis). Effect of microbiota on anastomotic healing  becomes well evident and demonstrated that collagenolytic bacteria (i.e., Enterococcus faecalis) impair healing leading to anastomotic leak with undesirable consequences. Among the patients’ physiological factors associated with post-operative leakage is obesity. Here we performed longitudinal analyses of colonic microbiota during the healing period after colon resection in mice to address if an obesity-related diet influences the post-operative colonic microbiome composition. 
Results: Pre-operatively, the colonic microbiota of PUFA- fed mice was characterized by lower diversity, a significant shift in composition (beta-diversity), and an alteration in the  Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in favor of increased Firmicutes. Longitudinal analysis of expelled stool in PUFA-fed mice demonstrated a bloom of Enterococcus at the second post-operative day (POD) 2-4 , reaching a relative abundance of 90%, whereas in Chow- fed mice a modest 15%  increase was observed. Eventually Enterococcus disappeared in Chow-fed mice at POD5, however  it persisted in expelled stool in PUFA fed mice and was observed at high density in the colonic tissues of PUFA-fed mice sacrificed on POD24-28. The microbiota of  Chow-fed mice was restored to its preoperative composition by POD14-18 however microbiota remained persistently disrupted in PUFA-fed mice. Collagenolytic Enterococcus, a phenotype previously demonstrated to be causative of anastomotic disruption, predominated in the anastomotic tissues of PUFA-fed mice and was accompanied by other potentially collagenolytic bacteria including Proteus and Serratia. PUFA, but not chow-fed mice demonstrated significantly impaired anastomotic healing in this model (p<0.001).
Conclusion. Pre-operative exposure of the colonic microbiota to the selective pressures of high fat/low fiber Western-type diet, preferable diet of obese human, has a major influence on the post-operative colonic microbiota characterized by a tremendous increase of Enterococcus associated with impaired anastomotic healing.

2018 Australia fish microbiome study ,"Atl salmon study
""Microbial Ecology of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Hatcheries: Impacts of the Built Environment on Fish Mucosal Microbiota""
ABSTRACT 
Successful rearing of fish in hatcheries is critical for conservation, recreational fishing, commercial fishing through wild stock enhancements, and aquaculture production. Flowthrough (FT) hatcheries require more water than recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), which enable up to 99% of their water to be recycled, thus significantly reducing environmental impacts. Here, we evaluated the biological and physical microbiome interactions of three Atlantic salmon hatcheries (RAS n = 2, FT n = 1). Gill, skin, and digesta from six juvenile fish along with tank biofilms and water were sampled from tanks in each of the hatcheries (60 fish across 10 tanks) to assess the built environment and mucosal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The water and tank biofilm had more microbial richness than fish mucus, while skin and digesta from RAS fish had 2 times the richness of FT fish. Body sites each had unique microbiomes (P < 0.001) and were influenced by hatchery system type (P < 0.001), with RAS being more similar. A strong association between the tank and fish microbiome was observed. Water and tank biofilm richness was positively correlated with skin and digesta richness. Strikingly, the gill, skin, and digesta communities were more similar to that in the origin tank biofilm than those in all other experimental tanks, suggesting that the tank biofilm has a direct influence on fish-associated microbial communities. Lastly, microbial diversity and mucous cell density were positively associated with fish growth and length. The results from this study provide evidence for a link between the tank microbiome and the fish microbiome, with the skin microbiome as an important intermediate.

Southern Bluefin Tuna study:
""The Southern Bluefin Tuna Mucosal Microbiome Is Influenced by Husbandry Method, Net Pen Location, and Anti-parasite Treatment""
ABSTRACT
Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for 4 to 8 months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research.

Yellowtail microbiome study:
""Impacts of the marine hatchery built environment and feed on mucosal microbiome colonization across ontogeny in yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi""
ABSTRACT
The fish gut microbiome is impacted by a number of biological and environmental factors including fish feed formulations. Unlike mammals, vertical microbiome transmission is largely absent in fish and thus little is known about how the gut microbiome is initially colonized during hatchery rearing nor the stability throughout growout stages. Here we investigate how various microbial-rich surfaces from the built environment ‘BE’ and feed influence the development of the mucosal microbiome (gill, skin, and digesta) of an economically important marine fish, yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, over time. For the first experiment, we sampled gill and skin microbiomes from 36 fish reared in three tank conditions, and demonstrate that the gill is more influenced by the surrounding environment than the skin. In a second experiment, fish mucous (gill, skin, and digesta), the BE (tank side, water, inlet pipe, airstones, and air diffusers) and feed were sampled from indoor reared fish at three ages (43 dph, 137 dph, 430 dph; n=12 per age). At 430 dph, 20 additional fish were sampled from an outdoor ocean net pen. A total of 304 samples were processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Gill and skin alpha diversity increased while gut diversity decreased with age. Diversity was much lower in fish from the ocean net pen compared to indoor fish. The gill and skin are most influenced by the BE early in development, with aeration equipment having more impact in later ages, while the gut microbiome becomes increasingly differentiated from the environment over time. Feed had a relatively low impact on driving microbial communities. Our findings suggest that S. lalandi mucosal microbiomes are differentially influenced by the built environment with a high turnover and rapid succession occurring in the gill and skin while the gut microbiome is more stable. We demonstrate how individual components of a hatchery system, especially aeration equipment, may contribute directly to microbiome development in a marine fish. In addition, results demonstrate how early life (larval) exposure to stressors in the rearing environment may influence fish microbiome development which is important for animal health and aquaculture production.

Gut microbiota from high-risk men who have sex with men drive immune activation in gnotobiotic mice and in vitro HIV infection,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have differences in immune activation and gut microbiome composition compared with men who have sex with women (MSW), even in the absence of HIV infection. Gut microbiome differences associated with HIV itself when controlling for MSM, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, are relatively subtle. Understanding whether gut microbiome composition impacts immune activation in HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM has important implications since immune activation has been associated with HIV acquisition risk and disease progression. To investigate the effects of MSM and HIV-associated gut microbiota on immune activation, we transplanted feces from HIV-negative MSW, HIV-negative MSM, and HIV-positive untreated MSM to gnotobiotic mice. Following transplant, 16S rRNA gene sequencing determined that the microbiomes of MSM and MSW maintained distinct compositions in mice and that specific microbial differences between MSM and MSW were replicated. Immunologically, HIV-negative MSM donors had higher frequencies of blood CD38+ HLADR+ and CD103+ T cells and their fecal recipients had higher frequencies of gut CD69+ and CD103+ T cells, compared with HIV-negative MSW donors and recipients, respectively. Significant microbiome differences were not detected between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM in this small donor cohort, and immune differences between their recipients were trending but not statistically significant. A larger donor cohort may therefore be needed to detect immune-modulating microbes associated with HIV. To investigate whether our findings in mice could have implications for HIV replication, we infected primary human lamina propria cells stimulated with isolated fecal microbiota, and found that microbiota from MSM stimulated higher frequencies of HIV-infected cells than microbiota from MSW. Finally, we identified several microbes that correlated with immune readouts in both fecal recipients and donors, and with in vitro HIV infection, which suggests a role for gut microbiota in immune activation and potentially HIV acquisition in MSM.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

In this study, we presented a continental-scale microbiome survey for hotel rooms (n = 68) spanning large geographic regions. Similar number of bacterial (4,344) and fungal (4,555) operational taxonomic units were identified in hotels, but the fungal taxa showed more endemic distribution compared to the bacterial taxa. Hotel bacteria were dominated by aerobic, ubiquitous taxa that can colonize in multiple ecological niches, and the most dominant hotel fungi was Aspergillus, especially in some low latitude hotels that the genus accounted for ~80% of total fungal load. Latitude was a major predictor for bacterial and fungal composition variation and fungal quantity, but not for microbial richness, which contradicted with common ecological patterns. Floor surface type was a predictor for bacterial composition, and factors associated with relative humidity such as seaside location and visible dampness or mold, were predictors for fungal composition. Redecoration age was the predictor for bacterial richness. Floor surface type and surrounding traffic were the predictor for fungal richness. Quality of interior, an evaluation on the indoor standard of textiles, walls and furnitures, was a predictor for multiple microbial characteristics including bacterial richness and composition, fungal composition and quantity, suggesting the importance of indoor furnishings in shaping the indoor microbial communities. This is the first study to reveal that different environmental characteristics determines microbial richness, composition variation and quantity in an indoor environment, and both global and indoor factors are important in shaping indoor microbiomes.

auto-FMT,"Antibiotic treatment can deplete the commensal bacteria of a patient's gut microbiota and, paradoxically, increase their risk of subsequent infections. In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), antibiotic administration is essential for optimal clinical outcomes but significantly disrupts intestinal microbiota diversity, leading to loss of many beneficial microbes. Although gut microbiota diversity loss during allo-HSCT is associated with increased mortality, approaches to reestablish depleted commensal bacteria have yet to be developed. We have initiated a randomized, controlled clinical trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT) versus no intervention and have analyzed the intestinal microbiota profiles of 25 allo-HSCT patients (14 who received auto-FMT treatment and 11 control patients who did not). Changes in gut microbiota diversity and composition revealed that the auto-FMT intervention boosted microbial diversity and reestablished the intestinal microbiota composition that the patient had before antibiotic treatment and allo-HSCT. These results demonstrate the potential for fecal sample banking and posttreatment remediation of a patient's gut microbiota after microbiota-depleting antibiotic treatment during allo-HSCT.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Medical biotechnology', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Concurrent measurement of microbiome and allergens in the air of bedrooms of allergy disease patients in the Chicago area,"The particulate and biological components of indoor air have a substantial impact on human health, especially immune respiratory conditions such as asthma. To better explore the relationship between allergens, the microbial community, and the indoor living environment, we sampled the bedrooms of 65 homes in the Chicago area using the patient-friendly Inspirotec electrokinetic air sampling device, which collects airborne particles for characterization of both allergens and microbial DNA. The sampling device captured sufficient microbial material to enable 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to be generated for every sample in the study. Neither the presence of HEPA filters, nor the height at which the air-sampling device was placed had any influence on the microbial community profile. A core microbiota of 31 OTUs were was present in more than three quarters of the samples, comprising around 45% of the relative sequence counts in each bedroom. The most abundant single organisms was Staphylococccus, and while the majority of the core taxa were predicted to be human-associated, the plant-associated genus Sphingomonas was found in the corewith other core taxa both human and outdoor-associated.. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly increased in bedrooms that reported having open windows, those with flowering plants in the vicinity, and those in homes occupied by dogs. Porphyromonas, Moraxella, Sutterella, and Clostridium, along with family Neisseraceae were significantly enriched in homes with dogs; interestingly, cats did not show a significant impact on microbial diversity or relative abundance. While dog allergen load was significantly correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, the taxa that significantly correlated with allergen burden did not exclusively overlap with those enriched in homes with dogs. Alternaria allergen load was positively correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, while Aspergillus allergen load was negatively correlated. The Alternaria allergen load was also significantly correlated with open windows. Microbial communities were significantly differentiated between rural, suburban and urban homes, and houses that were physically closer to each other maintained significantly more similar microbiota. We have demonstrated that it is possible to determine significant associations between allergen burden and the microbiota in air from the same sample, and that these associations relate to the characteristics of the home and neighborhoods.

"A simple microbiome in the European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis","The European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is used extensively in biological and biomedical research yet its microbiome remains poorly characterized. We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and fluorescence spectral imaging.  Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. This Vibrio was also the primary ASV found in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower abundance as determined by qPCR and was found only scattered in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer via imaging analysis. Treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic enrofloxacin led to a nearly 80% reduction of the dominant Vibrio ASV in the esophagus but did not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria overall between treated versus control animals. Data from the gills was dominated by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Animal study', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Exploring the microbiota of raw and pasteurized milk and the bacterial link to slits in commercial Cheddar cheese,"Milk and cheese are microbial ecosystems that can harbor diverse bacterial communities and therefore are vulnerable to spoilage and other defects. Cheese defects constitute a considerable burden to the dairy industry, among which slits are one of the most common concerns for Cheddar cheese. To advance the goal of producing cheese free of slit defects, we employed high-throughput DNA sequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes to understand how bacterial communities of raw and pasteurized milk affect the cheese quality. Included in our DNA sequencing approach is the capacity to distinguish between living and total bacteria by the application of propidium monoazide (PMA). Examination of Cheddar cheese samples showed a steady decline in alpha diversity of non-starter bacteria during the 120-day aging period. Compositional changes were also observed such that Streptococcus and Pseudomonas proportions decreased and Lactobacillus and Bacillus increased towards the end of aging. 
Comparisons between matched milk and cheese samples indicated cheese defects could be associated with the bacterial communities in pasteurized milk. Cheese that contained slits was made from milk harboring fewer contaminating bacterial cells but a larger number of species compared to milk that resulted in high-quality cheese. The presence of Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus and Turicibacter in pasteurized milk were also correlated with slits in cheese. The abundance of these genera were also highly dependent on equipment-cleaning schedules and their proportions decreased over 3-fold immediately after cleaning. Overall, our findings show that the slit defects might be due to a subpopulation of bacterial strains that survive milk pasteurization (HTST) in low abundance but persist and remain metabolically active during cheese fermentation. This work contributes to our understanding of bacterial population dynamics in dairy processing facilities and provides opportunities to modify cleaning and processing protocols to ensure the consistent production of high-quality dairy products.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Biotechnology', 'Microbiology'}",{'Food science'}
A comparison of sample processing and bacterial lysis methods for dairy product DNA extraction using automation friendly kits ,"The bacterial composition of milk and other dairy products are important determinants of product safety and quality. Therefore, accurate assessments of bacterial populations in milk are of great importance to the dairy industry. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing technologies are increasingly used in examining the dairy ecosystems. However, without standards methods, inconsistent and contradictory results have been reported. Therefore, in this study, by using both bacterial cell mock community and real milk samples, we evaluated a number of factors including milk collection volumes (200 L, 1 mL, 10 mL and 30 mL), storage conditions (freeze with PBS or 25% glycerol and 5 cycles of freeze-thaw), propidium monoazide treatment to enrich for viable cells, DNA extraction kits (MagMAX Total, CORE and Ultra 2.0) and cell lysis methods. The method of cell lysis conferred the largest variation on bacterial diversities, with effect sizes of 0.76 (Bray-Curtis) and 0.54 (weighted UniFrac). Specifically, gentle lysis methods (bead beat for 10 s at 4 m/s or vortex at 1800 rpm for 10 s) paired with MagMAX Total kit and proteinase K digestion provided the most accurate mock community representation, resulting in up to 12.3-fold reduction in Bray-Curtis distances from theoretical values compared to CORE and Ultra 2.0 kits using harsh lysis methods (bead beat twice for 1 min at 6.5 m/s with 1 min interval on ice or vortex at 1800 rpm for 15 min). This DNA extraction method (Total + proteinase K + gentle lysis) was also validated by raw and pasteurized milk samples. For the upstream milk collection, at least 10 mL should be sampled for consistent representation of the full community. Storage conditions caused minor variations on bacterial diversity, with effect sizes of 0.12 (Bray-Curtis) and 0.09 (weighted UniFrac). PMA inhibition of dead cells were variable between organisms.

Remitted affective disorders and high familial risk of affective disorders associate with aberrant intestinal microbiota,"OBJECTIVE:
Affective disorders seem associated with aberrant intestinal microbiota but whether this pattern also occurs in individuals at increased heritable risk is unknown. We investigated associations between gut microbiota profiles and affective disorders by comparing monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant (affected twins with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission) and discordant to affective disorders (high-risk) with MZ twins without affective disorders (low-risk).
METHODS:
Stool samples were collected from 128 MZ twins and the microbiome was profiled using 16S rDNA sequencing of the V3-V4 region.
RESULTS:
Affected twins had a lower diversity and an absence of a specific operational taxonomical unit (OTU) in comparison with low-risk twins. The high-risk twins exhibited the same pattern although the lower diversity was only at a trend level. The OTU belonged to the family Christensenellaceae. The findings were not explained by lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, or psychotropic medication).
CONCLUSION:
Affected twins in remission and high-risk twins presented aberrant gut microbiota with depletion of a specific OTU. If replicated, this reduced relative sequence absence may together with the globally altered microbiota composition act as a vulnerability marker by accentuating the effect of gene-environment interactions in individuals genetically disposed for an affective disorder.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Defining seasonal marine microbial community dynamics,"In order to facilitate conservation of biological diversity we require comprehensive knowledge of the microbial ecology of an ecosystem.

For this purpose, surface water samples were collected from the sampling station, L4, every week for a year. The respiration rate of the heterotrophic microbial community was determined from the decrease in dissolved oxygen content of the less than 0.8m size-fraction of the sea water. We are currently analyzing captured DNA using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing to determine the diversity and functional profile of the active bacteria in order to characterize annual changes in the active bacterial community. This dataset sits within the larger framework of the Western English Channel bacterial diversity time series (2003-2009) and the seasonal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies associated with this site.

Effect of sulfite addition and pied de cuve inoculation on the microbial communities and sensory profiles of Chardonnay wines: dominance of indigenous Saccharomyces uvarum at a commercial winery,"The production of wine involves complex interactions between many microbial species and strains, and the microbial consortium of wine fermentations is also highly dependent upon winemaking decisions made at crush. To investigate how these decisions can affect the microbial communities and sensory attributes of commercially-produced wines, Chardonnay grape juice was allowed to ferment uninoculated, or was inoculated with a pied de cuve inoculum composed of vineyard-derived bacteria and fungi. Additionally, either 0 mg/L or 40 mg/L of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was added to the juice at crush. The bacterial and fungal communities of these wines were monitored using high-throughput amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq), and Saccharomyces yeasts were identified to the strain level using microsatellite analysis. After fermentation, the wines were evaluated by a panel of wine experts to determine any differences in sensory profiles among treatments. When no SO2 was added at crush, the wines underwent alcoholic fermentation and malolactic fermentation simultaneously. Tatumella bacteria were also present in significant numbers only in the barrels to which no SO2 was added. These bacteria are likely responsible for the malolactic fermentation observed in the no-SO2  treatments and are reported here for the first time in North American wine fermentations. Additionally, all fermentations were dominated by indigenous Saccharomyces uvarum, and 150 unique S. uvarum strains were identified, with differences in strain composition as a result of SO2 addition. Wines that did not receive SO2 at crush were rated more fruity and less acidic than wines that received SO2. Wines receiving SO2 were considered to have less-desirable traits such as earthy and sulfur aroma/flavour. The pied de cuve inoculum had a limited effect on the microbial community, and only persisted when no SO2 was added; these wines did not fully complete alcoholic fermentation, and were rated to be higher in body and sweetness, and lower in acidity, than the other wines. This is the first report of indigenous S. uvarum strains dominating and completing alcoholic fermentation at a commercial winery in North America.

Further, weighted UniFrac- and random forest-based graph analyses uncovered two distinct spheres of hand or shoe associated samples. For hand-associated samples, connection between cliques was enriched for hands, implicating them as a primary means of transmission.

Atherosclerosis, the buildup of fats and cholesterol in arterial walls as plaques, is often associated with CVD. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of implementing a time restricted feeding regimen to attenuate diet-induced obesity in mice by restoring circadian cycling and robust host-microbe cycling. We set out to test whether genetically induced atherosclerotic conditions could be alleviated by a time restricted feeding diet regimen. Genetic atherosclerotic mouse models Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- were all placed on a high fat, high cholesterol atherogenic diet. Both Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- mice were either fed on an ad libitum or time restricted feeding regimen (n=6 for each condition).",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Nutritional science', 'Animal study'}",{'Nutrition science'}
Yeast and bacterial inoculation practices influence the microbial communities and sensory profiles of barrel-fermented Chardonnay wines,"Microbial communities during alcoholic fermentation (AF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF) can affect the sensory attributes of the finished wine. When MLF is desired, it is common to initiate AF by inoculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae, followed by inoculation with Oenococcus oeni. In this study, fresh grape must was subjected to a combination of inoculation treatments with S. cerevisiae and O. oeni. Bacterial and yeast community dynamics, and S. cerevisiae and O. oeni populations, were monitored using culture-dependent and culture-independent technologies. The sensory profiles of the finished wines were evaluated by a panel of experts. Yeast inoculation affected the yeast community and the S. cerevisiae population; wines left uninoculated had a higher diversity of S. cerevisiae strains and contained more Torulaspora delbrueckii. At the end of MLF, the inoculated O. oeni strain dominated the treatments to which it was added, but the wines that were not inoculated contained unique assemblages of O. oeni strains, including potentially indigenous strains. Wines that fermented uninoculated were rated higher in intensity for most sensory attributes, including tropical fruit, butter, and vanilla. These results highlight the importance of relating wine sensory attributes to the fungi and bacteria present in the wine, at both the species and strain levels.

Variation in Microbiome LPS Immunogenicity Contributes to Autoimmunity in Humans,"The goal of the DIABIMMUNE three country cohort is to study the hygiene hypothesis: DIABIMMUNE researchers are seeking to find biological mechanisms that may explain the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies in modern western societies compared to developing countries. We recruited families from three countries that have substantial differences of incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and allergies: Finland, which has the highest incidence of T1D globally; Estonia, where the rate of autoimmune disease is increasing rapidly as its society is modernizing; and Russia, where T1D and allergies are still rare compared to Finland and Estonia. Early infancy (roughly the first six months of life) is consider to be important for the maturation of the immune system, or ""immune education"". Therefore, we have followed newborn infant from each country from birth until the age of three. Seventy-four infants from each country were selected on the basis of similar HLA risk (predisposition to T1D) and matching gender. For each infant, three years of monthly stool samples, laboratory assays, and questionnaires regarding breastfeeding, diet, allergies, infections, family history, use of drugs and clinical examinations were collected. In accordance with the recruitment criteria for the DIABIMMUNE cohort, all subjects had increased HLA-conferred susceptibility to autoimmunity. In order to study the gut microbiome of these infants, we sequenced a total of 1584 stool samples using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and 785 stool samples using whole-genome shotgun sequencing.

Effect of matched weight loss induced by low-calorie diet versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on metabolic function in type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that in people with type 2 diabetes, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has therapeutic effects on metabolic function that are independent of weight loss. METHODS: We evaluated metabolic regulators of glucose homeostasis before and after matched (approximately 18%) weight loss induced by gastric bypass (surgery group) or diet alone (diet group) in 22 patients with obesity and diabetes. The primary outcome was the change in hepatic insulin sensitivity, assessed by infusion of insulin at low rates (stages 1 and 2 of a 3-stage hyperinsulinemic euglycemic pancreatic clamp). Secondary outcomes were changes in muscle insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and 24-hour plasma glucose and insulin profiles. RESULTS: Weight loss was associated with increases in mean suppression of glucose production from baseline, by 7.04 μmol per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.74 to 9.33) in the diet group and by 7.02 μmol per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute (95% CI, 3.21 to 10.84) in the surgery group during clamp stage 1, and by 5.39 (95% CI, 2.44 to 8.34) and 5.37 (95% CI, 2.41 to 8.33) μmol per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute in the two groups, respectively, during clamp stage 2; there were no significant differences between the groups. Weight loss was associated with increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, from 30.5±15.9 to 61.6±13.0 μmol per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute in the diet group and from 29.4±12.6 to 54.5±10.4 μmol per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute in the surgery group; there was no significant difference between the groups. Weight loss increased beta-cell function (insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity) by 1.83 units (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.44) in the diet group and by 1.11 units (95% CI, 0.08 to 2.15) in the surgery group, with no significant difference between the groups, and it decreased the areas under the curve for 24-hour plasma glucose and insulin levels in both groups, with no significant difference between the groups. No major complications occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study involving patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, the metabolic benefits of gastric bypass surgery and diet were similar and were apparently related to weight loss itself, with no evident clinically important effects independent of weight loss.

Response of Salivary Microbiota to Caries Preventative Treatment in Australian Indigenous Children,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have disproportionately poorer oral health than non-Indigenous Australian children, especially in rural communities. For three years, a once-annual caries preventative (Intervention) treatment was offered to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schoolchildren of Northern Peninsula Area (NPA), Queensland, which significantly improved their oral health. Here, we examine the salivary oral microbiota of these children to understand the ecological mechanisms behind this improvement in clinical outcome. Saliva samples from children (mean age = 10 ± 2.96 years; N = 104) were used to reconstruct bacterial community composition and taxonomic abundance, with high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Microbial communities of children who received the Intervention treatment had lower taxonomic diversity than those who did not receive treatment (Shannon, p < 0.05). Moreover, the Intervention’s impact upon microbial diversity was more evident in children with active carious lesions existing at the time of saliva collection. Potential caries biomarkers were detected as the relative abundance of several microbial species, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Parascardovia denticolens, and Mitsuokella HMT 131 were found significantly increased (p < 0.05) in children with severe caries, especially in children who did not receive the Intervention treatment. Overall, this is the first study to describe the oral microbiota from Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, simultaneously providing insight into microbial association with caries and the ecological response to treatment. Further studies are required for understanding how caries-preventative therapy induces these microbial ecological shifts and what the microbial functional repercussions of such alterations are, long-term, to further improve oral health disparities within Australia.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Taxonomy', 'Microbiology', 'Public health and epidemiology'}",set()

"Evaluation of the effect of storage methods on fecal, saliva, and skin microbiome composition","As the number of human microbiome studies expand, it is increasingly important to identify cost-effective, practical preservatives that allow for room temperature sample storage. Here, we re-analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from a large sample storage study published in 2016, and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on remnant DNA from this experiment. Both results support the initial findings that 95% ethanol, a non-toxic, cost-effective preservative, is effective at preserving samples at room temperature for weeks. We expanded on this analysis by collecting a new set of fecal, saliva, and skin samples to determine the optimal ratio of 95% ethanol to sample. We identified optimal collection protocols for fecal samples (storing a fecal swab in 95% ethanol) and saliva samples (storing unstimulated saliva in 95% ethanol at a ratio of 1:2). Storing skin swabs in 95% ethanol reduced microbial biomass and disrupted community composition, highlighting the difficulties of low biomass sample preservation.

Soy Consumption with Equol Production and frequent Lactose ingestion in a Cohort of Healthy Puerto Rican Women Reveals Decreased Gut Health,"Hispanic women are more likely to die of breast cancer, a health disparity attributed to the environment and diet.

The active ingredient of daidzein is equol, which is metabolized from daidzein by gut bacteria found in ~30% of the population. Interestingly, one study shows that Hispanic women are more likely to be efficient equol producers than Caucasians. To test the hypothesis that high equol production by Hispanic women may contribute to breast cancer malignancy, we initiated a cross-sectional characterization of the equol production efficiency of a clinic-based sample of premenopausal Puerto Rican women.

The Screamer Gut Microbiome,"The horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) is a member of Anhimidae family (Anseriformes order), with two species more (southern screamer (Chauna chavaria) and the northern screamer (Chauna torquata). Horned screamers are distributed in tropical lowland fresh water of Venezuela, the eastern llanos of Columbia, eastern Bolivia and south-central Brazil (Naranjo 1986; Piland, 2010).  This species is catalog by IUCN as Least Concern (LC), because has a large range distribution, and population decline is not to be sufficiently rapid (BirdLife International, 2012). One study in Ecuador report that agriculture expansion and cattle ranching are reduced the Horned Screamer population (Avala et al., 2009). The natural habitat of Venezuela had been destroyed by agriculture and livestock grazing expansion causing loss of biodiversity (Fundación La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, 2010). However information about this bird is reduced to a few studies realized in Colombia and Ecuador (Gill et al., 1974; Barrow et al 1986; Naranjo, 1986; Avala et al., 2009) and in Venezuela information is reduce a few counts reported by NWC (Martinez, 2011, 2012; Sainz-Borgo, 2013; Sainz-Borgo et al., 2014, 2015). The Horned Screamer eats a variety of small shrubs and buds grazing and digging along the water (Naranjo, 1986; Piland, 2010; Hilty, 2013).

Multi-omics analyses of the ulcerative colitis gut microbiome link Bacteroides vulgatus proteases with disease severity,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is driven by disruptions in host–microbiota homoeostasis, but current treatments exclusively target host inflammatory pathways. To understand how host–microbiota interactions become disrupted in UC, we collected and analysed six faecal- or serum-based omic datasets (metaproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, metapeptidomic and amplicon sequencing profiles of faecal samples and proteomic profiles of serum samples) from 40 UC patients at a single inflammatory bowel disease centre, as well as various clinical, endoscopic and histologic measures of disease activity. A validation cohort of 210 samples (73 UC, 117 Crohn’s disease, 20 healthy controls) was collected and analysed separately and independently. Data integration across both cohorts showed that a subset of the clinically active UC patients had an overabundance of proteases that originated from the bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus. To test whether B. vulgatus proteases contribute to UC disease activity, we first profiled B. vulgatus proteases found in patients and bacterial cultures. Use of a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor improved B. vulgatus-induced barrier dysfunction in vitro, and prevented colitis in B. vulgatus monocolonized, IL10-deficient mice. Furthermore, transplantation of faeces from UC patients with a high abundance of B. vulgatus proteases into germfree mice induced colitis dependent on protease activity. These results, stemming from a multi-omics approach, improve understanding of functional microbiota alterations that drive UC and provide a resource for identifying other pathways that could be inhibited as a strategy to treat this disease.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomics'}",set()

Comparative analyses of foregut and hindgut bacterial communities in Slick Holsteins and Wild type Holsteins when fed totally mixed rations (TMR) diets in a tropical climate.,"One of the greatest challenges to dairy production in subtropical and tropical regions of the world is heat stress.  In the future, climate change may also expose the temperate regions of the world to hotter and longer hot seasons which might increasingly expose dairy cows to chronic heat stress, negatively affecting dairy productivity. 
To minimize the effects of heat stress, three management strategies have been identified: 1) physical modification of the environment, 2) improved nutritional management practices, 3) genetic development of heat-tolerant breeds. Unfortunately, heat tolerance is negatively correlated with production 
In Puerto Rico US Holstein crossings with Criollo cattle produced PR Holsteins (slick-hair Holsteins) with higher milk production and shorter calving interval than their wild-type. PR Holsteins “rabifinas” exhibit a very short, sleek, and mostly glossy coat very similar to the phenotype described by Olson et al. in 2003, after introducing the Slick gene from the Senepol into Holstein cows. 
As “wild type” and Slick Holstein dairy cows experience heat stress differently, we hypothesize that under heat stress conditions “wild type” and Slick Holstein dairy cows will have a different rumen and hindgut microbiomes, and these differences could help explain putative variance in feed efficiency between these types of cattle. We sequenced 16S rRNA genes from wt and slick cows in both the foregut and hindgut samples to relate to feed efficiency and milk production.

"Prenatal low-dose penicillin results in long-term sex-specific changes to murine behaviour, brain, immune regulation, and gut microbiota","Growing evidence suggests that environmental disruptors of maternal microbes may have significant detrimental consequences for the developing fetus. Antibiotic exposure during early life can have long-term effects on neurodevelopment in mice and humans. Here we explore whether exposure to low-dose penicillin only during the last week of gestation in mice has long-term effects on offspring behaviour, brain, immune function, and gut microbiota. We found that this treatment had striking sex-specific effects in the adult mouse offspring. Female mice demonstrated decreased anxiety-like behaviours, while male mice had abnormal social behaviours which correlated with altered brain expression of AVPR1A, AVPR1B, and OXTR, and decreases in the proportion of splenic FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Prenatal penicillin exposure also led to distinct microbiota compositions that were sex-dependent. These data suggest that exposure of pregnant mice to even a low dose of penicillin through only the last week before birth is nonetheless sufficient to induce long-term developmental changes in both male and female offspring.

Microbiota and body composition during the period of complementary feeding,"Objectives
This study aimed to explore the associations between food group intake, faecal microbiota profile and body composition during the period of complementary feeding. 
Methods
Diet was assessed using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire, faecal microbiota profile was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, in a cohort of 50 infants aged 6 to 24 months of age.
Results
During this critical period of microbiota development, age was the strongest predictor of microbiota composition with network analysis revealing a cluster of genera positively associated with age. A separate cluster comprised genera associated with Fat Mass Index with Bifidobacterium showing the strongest correlation with Fat Mass Index (rho = 0.55, p = 0.001, FDR = 0.018). Dairy intake was both negatively correlated with Bacteroides (rho = -0.49, p < 0.001, FDR = 0.024) and positively correlated with Lean Mass Index (rho = 0.44, p = 0.007, FDR = 0.024). Antibiotics use in the first month of life had the most striking influence on body composition and was associated with an increase in mean BMI (Body Mass Index) Z score of 1.17 (p = 0.001) and body fat of 3.5% (p = 0.001). 
Conclusions
Our results suggested that antibiotics use in the first month of life had the most striking influence on body composition in this cohort of infants aged 6 to 24 months while dairy intake interacted with both microbiota and body composition in early life.

Gut inflammation in polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock,"Severe injuries are frequently accompanied by hemorrhagic shock and harbor an increased risk for complications. Local or systemic inflammation after trauma/hemorrhage may lead to a leaky intestinal epithelial barrier and
subsequent translocation of gut microbiota, potentially worsening outcome. To evaluate the extent with which trauma affects the gut microbiota composition, we performed a post hoc analysis of a murine model of polytrauma and hemorrhage. Four hours after injury, organs and plasma samples were collected, and the diversity and composition of the cecal microbiome were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although cecal microbial composition was not found to be different between experimental groups, catecholamine support in shock animals resulted in higher numbers of distinct microbial features. We observed that the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators in plasma and intestinal tissue were associated with measures of microbial alpha- and beta-diversity and the presence of specific microbial drivers of inflammation. In conclusion, we found associations between measures of gut microbial alpha- and beta-diversity and the severity of systemic and local gut inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that four hours following injury is too early for development of global changes in the intestinal microbiome. Future investigations with increased temporal-spatial resolution are needed in order to fully elucidate the effects of trauma and shock on the gut microbiome, biological signatures of inflammation, and proximal and distal outcomes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Trauma medicine', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Faecal Microbiota Dynamics and their Relation to Disease Course in Crohns Disease,"BACKGROUND: Microbial shifts have been associated with disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD), but findings on specific taxa are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in applied methods and cross-sectional study designs. We prospectively examined the fecal microbiota in adult CD patients with changing or stable disease course over time. METHODS: Feces was collected at two time-points from 15 healthy individuals (HC), 35 CD patients that maintained remission (RR) and 22 during remission and subsequent exacerbation (RA). The microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA (V4) gene sequencing. RESULTS: Compared to HC, CD patients had a lower microbial richness (p=0.0002) and diversity (p=0.005). Moreover, the microbial community structure of a subset of patients clustered apart from HC, characterized by low microbial diversity and Faecalibacterium abundance. Patients within this cluster did not differ with respect to long-term disease course compared to patients with a ""healthy-like"" microbiota.Over time, microbial richness and diversity did not change in RR versus RA patients. Although the microbial community structure of both RR and RA patients was less stable over time compared to HC, no differences were observed between the patient groups (p=0.17), nor was the stability impacted by Montreal classification, medication use or surgery. CONCLUSION: The altered microbiota composition and stability in CD was neither associated with disease activity nor long-term disease course, questioning its involvement in the development of an exacerbation. The aberrant microbiota composition in a subset of CD patients, warrants further exploration of a more microbiota-driven etiology in this group.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology'}",set()

An indigenous Saccharomyces uvarum population with high genetic diversity dominates uninoculated Chardonnay fermentations at a Canadian winery,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the primary yeast species responsible for most fermentations in winemaking. However, other yeasts, including Saccharomyces uvarum, have occasionally been found conducting commercial fermentations around the world. S. uvarum is typically associated with white wine fermentations in cool-climate wine regions, and has been identified as the dominant yeast in fermentations from France, Hungary, northern Italy, and, recently, Canada. However, little is known about how the origin and genetic diversity of the Canadian S. uvarum population relates to strains from other parts of the world. In this study, a highly diverse S. uvarum population was found dominating uninoculated commercial fermentations of Chardonnay grapes sourced from two different vineyards. Most of the strains identified were found to be genetically distinct from S. uvarum strains isolated around the world. Of the 106 strains of S. uvarum identified in this study, four played a dominant role in the fermentations, with some strains predominating in the fermentations from one vineyard over the other. Furthermore, two of the dominant strains were previously identified as dominant strains in uninoculated Chardonnay fermentations at the same winery two years earlier, providing evidence for a winery-resident population of indigenous S. uvarum.

Dietary fat and fiber impacts intestinal microbiome resilience to antibiotics and Clostridoides difficile infection in mice,"Abstract:  Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and emerging evidence has linked dietary components with CDI pathogenesis,  suggesting that dietary modulation may be an effective strategy for prevention. Here, we show that mice fed a high-fat/low-fiber “Western type” diet (WD) had dramatically increased mortality in a murine model of antibiotic-induced CDI compared to a low-fat/low-fiber (LF/LF) diet and standard mouse chow controls. We found that the WD had a pro- C. difficile bile acid composition that was driven in part by higher levels of primary bile acids that are produced to digest fat, and a lower level of secondary bile acids that are produced by the gut microbiome. This lack of secondary bile acids was associated with a greater disturbance to the gut microbiome with antibiotics in both the WD and LF/LF diet compared to mouse chow. Mice fed the WD also had the highest level of toxin TcdA just prior to the onset of mortality, but not of TcdB or inflammation.  These findings indicate that dietary intervention to decrease fat may complement previously proposed strategies to prevent CDI in high-risk individuals.

HISEAS,"During space simulation experiments the crew’s safety and health are challenged by an extreme confinement from the surrounding hostile environment with specific implications and exposures for the human microbiome. 
To better understand microbial dynamics in isolated and confined built environments (ICE), front torso skin of 6 crewmembers and frequently interacted surfaces of the furniture in an only 11-meter-in-diameter dome located on the barren slopes of the Mauna-Loa volcano in Hawaii were sampled for a whole year (HI-SEAS IV). The crew was isolated and confined, and hygiene practices were restricted. 181 microbiome samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling and qPCR as well as the antimicrobial resistance profile (covering detergents and multidrug resistances e.g. qacE-delta1, int1, bla and tetM). 
In contrast to our previous study (Schwendner et al. 2017) the microbial diversity increased slightly in the built environment, and even stronger and significantly (P = 8.7 x 10E-19) on the skin of the crew members. Metadata predictions showed high model accuracy (97%) for different sampling categories and the day of sampling (R = 0.8, P = 2.3 x 10E-8). Differential abundance analysis indicated a discriminative pattern for microbial communities at the beginning (Gardnerella) and end (Kocuria, Dermacoccaceae, Brevundimonas) of the isolation period. Important microbial and metabolic features to predict sample states were identified by a supervised learning regressor. Hence, detected microbes faced their exposure to this ICE by many detoxification mechanisms against stress inducing factors from the environment or its maintenance by the crew (e.g. mycothiol and ectoine biosynthesis). 
Overall the interaction of the skin microbiome and the microbiome of the built environment seems to be highly dynamic especially in this confined habitat.

Projection of gut microbiome pre and post bariatric surgery to predict surgery outcome,"Bariatric surgery is often the preferred method to resolve obesity and diabetes, with ~800,000 cases worldwide yearly and high outcome variability. The ability to predict the long-term BMI change following surgery has important implications on individuals and the health care system in general. Given the tight connection between eating habits, sugar consumption, BMI and the gut microbiome, we tested whether the microbiome before any treatment is associated with different treatment outcomes, as well as other intakes (HDL, Triglycerides, etc.). 
A projection of the gut microbiome composition of obese (sampled before and after bariatric surgery) and slim patients into principal components reveals 3 different microbiome profiles belonging to slim subjects, obese and obese who underwent bariatric surgery, as opposed to the current conjecture that there are only two profiles – slim and obese. 
The same projection allows for a prediction of BMI loss following bariatric surgery, using only the pre-surgery microbiome, which may upgrade the decision-making process of whether to undergo the procedure or not. 
A different projection is associated with sugar metabolism and A1C levels. These results may be translated into better clinical management of obese individuals planning to undergo metabolic surgery.

Bacterial Community Spatial and Temporal Variation in a North Temperate Bog Lake,"Bog lakes such as Mary Lake in northern Wisconsin are ideal systems to investigate microbial communities due to easily identified spatial boundaries and well characterized seasonal ecosystem dynamics. Multiple factors are thought to influence the bacterial communities within the lake, and our goal in this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal factors causing the variations between these populations. Molecular techniques and statistical analyses were performed to gain insight into which differences
 caused the greatest variability. The bacterial communities were analyzed based on conserved 16S ribosomal RNA sequences as well as on short base pair sequence reads obtained from a time series in 2009 in order to determine whether the bacterial community was more variable in space or in time. We found that while the upper and lower thermal layers of the bog were composed of similar microbial communities, these communities had different temporal patterns throughout the time series.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Temple TX native exotic precip study,"Bacterial biodiversity between native and novel exotic-dominated communities exposed to irrigation treatment  In many systems, novel exotic-dominated plant communities are replacing native plant communities. We experimentally compared species diversity decline between nine-species grassland communities under field conditions to test whether bacterial diversity differed between communities containing all exotic or all native plant species, using a pool of 40 plant species.  Mixtures (64) were established with equal functional group proportions using a paired species approach that controlled for phylogeny and growth form between pairs of native and exotic plant species.  Origin (native vs. exotic) was crossed with summer irrigation treatments.   Here we examine weather changes in climate, plant biomass and plant diversity affect bacterial community composition.  Aboveground biomass was greater in exotic than native plots, and this difference was larger in mixtures than in monocultures. Plant species diversity declined more in exotic than native plant communities. Using 16S rDNA, we will determine if soil microbial communities are sensitive to changes in irrigation and plant communities, or if soil microbial communities are resilient, resulting in minimal changes in soil bacterial community composition.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Cardiometabolic profile,"During the postmenopausal period, the risk of cardiovascular diseases is increased in many obese women and is associated with a worse cardiometabolic profile and a sub-chronic low-grade systemic inflammation caused by a gut barrier permeability dysfunction. Here, we tested whether administration of two different dosages of the multispecies probiotic Ecologic® Barrier influenced the cardiometabolic biochemical parameters and lipopolysaccharide levels, the latter used as a marker of increased gut permeability in obese postmenopausal women. A total of 81 obese Caucasian postmenopausal women participated in the trial. The subjects were randomly assigned to three groups that received a placebo, a low dose (LD) (2.5 × 10⁸ colony forming units (CFU) per day), or a high dose (HD) (1 × 1010 CFU per day) of lyophilisate powder containing live multispecies probiotic bacteria. The probiotic supplement was administered each day in two equal portions for 12 weeks. We found significant (p < 0.05) favorable changes (mostly large or medium effects) in the evaluated parameters in both the HD and LD groups but not in the placebo group. In the HD group, lipopolysaccharide, waist, fat mass, subcutaneous fat, uric acid, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and insulin-resistant index (HOMA-IR) were improved. Similar changes were observed in the LD group, except for lipopolysaccharide, uric acid, triglycerides, and glucose levels. Additionally, significant differences were observed in both groups in terms of fat percentage and visceral fat. When the mean changes were compared between the three groups, statistically significant differences in lipopolysaccharide levels, uric acid, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were found. Post hoc tests revealed significant differences in the mean changes (mostly medium effects) between the HD and LD groups for uric acid, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. In the 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention, we observed that supplementation with the multispecies probiotic Ecologic® Barrier favorably affected the risk factors in a dose-dependent manner, showing beneficial effects on the cardiometabolic parameters and gut permeability of the patients.

We found the microbiome composition of allergic patients to be significantly different compared to age-matched controls, with distinct microbial signatures that differentiate FA patients from healthy non-allergic controls, and distinct microbial signatures for FA to different foods. We used these microbial differences to distinguish between FA patients and non- allergic healthy controls with 85% accuracy, and for the classification of FA patients according to their FA types using a supervised learning algorithm.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', '""Allergy, clinical immunology and immunotherapeutics""', 'Immunology'}",set()
Gut microbiome heritability is nearly universal but environmentally contingent,"Relatives have more similar gut microbiomes than nonrelatives, but the degree to which this similarity results from shared genotypes versus shared environments has been controversial. Here, we leveraged 16,234 gut microbiome profiles, collected over 14 years from 585 wild baboons, to reveal that host genetic effects on the gut microbiome are nearly universal. Controlling for diet, age, and socioecological variation, 97% of microbiome phenotypes were significantly heritable, including several reported as heritable in humans. Heritability was typically low (mean = 0.068) but was systematically greater in the dry season, with low diet diversity, and in older hosts. We show that longitudinal profiles and large sample sizes are crucial to quantifying microbiome heritability, and indicate scope for selection on microbiome characteristics as a host phenotype.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",set()
Integrated multi-cohort analysis of the Parkinsons disease gut metagenome - RUMC,"Background: A growing body of evidence suggests alterations in the gut microbiome are associated with a Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis. 

Objective: To profile the gut metagenome in PD for alterations in microbiome composition, differentially abundant taxa, functional metabolic pathways, and microbial gene products and their relationship with disease progression.

Methods: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted on 244 unique donors from two independent cohorts in the United States, including individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD, n=48, n=47, respectively), Household Controls (HC, n=29, n=30), and Population Controls (PC, n=41, n=49). Microbial features consistently altered in PD compared to environmental and community controls were identified. Data were cross-referenced to public metagenomic datasets from two previous PD studies in Germany or China to determine globally generalizable microbiome features.

Results: The gut microbiome in PD shows modest but significant alterations in community composition. Robust taxonomic alterations include a depletion in the beneficial gut commensals Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and various Eubacterium and Roseburia species, and increased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and various Bifidobacterium species. Pathway enrichment analysis and metabolic potential, constructed from microbial gene abundance, revealed disruptions in microbial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and an increase in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. These global gene-level signatures of the PD microbiome indicate an increased response to oxidative stress, decreased cellular growth and microbial motility, and disrupted inter-community bacterial signaling. 

Conclusion: Gut profiles of PD participants show consistent alterations in taxonomic representation, functional metabolic potential, and microbial gene abundance across four independent metagenomic studies from three continents. These data suggest alterations in the PD microbiome may contribute to PD physiology, but do not exclude microbiome imprinting by disease status.

A single early-in-life antibiotic course increases susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis,"Background. There is increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation of the immune system and prevention of diseases during childhood. Early life short-course antibiotic use may affect the progression of subsequent disease conditions by changing both host microbiota and immunologic development. Epidemiologic studies provide evidence that early life antibiotic exposures predispose to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

Methods. By using a murine model of Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, we evaluated the effect on disease outcomes of early-life pulsed antibiotic treatment (PAT) using tylosin, a macrolide and amoxicillin, a beta-lactam. We evaluated microbiota effects at the 16S rRNA gene level, and intestinal T-cells by flow cytometry. Antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota were transferred to pups that then were challenged with DSS.

Results. A single PAT course early-in-life exacerbated later DSS-induced colitis by both perturbing the microbial community and altering mucosal immune cell composition. By conventionalizing germ-free mice with either antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota obtained 40 days after the challenge ended, we showed the transferrable and direct effect of the still-perturbed microbiota on colitis severity in the DSS model.

Conclusions. The findings in this experimental model provide evidence that early-life microbiota perturbation may increase risk of colitis later in life. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()
The immune response and microbiota profiles during co-infection with P. vivax and soil-transmitted helminths,"Co-infection with soil transmitted helminths (STH) and Plasmodium spp. parasites is a common occurrence in tropical developing countries, but the consequences of this interaction remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-omic analysis on the peripheral blood and fecal samples of 130 individuals in Tierralta, Córdoba, Colombia who were infected with P. vivax alone (n = 33), co-infected with P. vivax and STH (n = 27), infected with STH alone (n = 39) or were infected with neither P. vivax nor STH (n = 31). In addition to Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential, transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood samples was performed by RNA-Seq, fecal microbial communities were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and circulating cytokine levels were measured by bead-based immunoassays. Differences in blood cell counts were driven primarily by P. vivax infection, including an increased percentage of neutrophils that was associated with a transcriptional signature of neutrophil activation in the blood. P. vivax infection was also associated with increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and these cytokine levels were not affected by STH co-infection.  Surprisingly, P. vivax infection was more strongly associated with changes in the microbiome than STH infection. Children infected with P. vivax exhibited elevated Bacteroides and reduced Prevotella and Clostridiaceae, but these differences were not observed in individuals co-infected with STH. We also observed that P. vivax parasitemia is higher in STH-infected population. When we used machine learning to identify the most important predictors of P. vivax parasite burden from all measured variables, bacterial taxa were the strongest predictors of parasitemia levels in P. vivax infected individuals. In contrast, circulating TGF- β was identified as the strongest predictor of T. trichiura egg burden. This study provides unexpected evidence that the gut microbiota may have a stronger link with P. vivax than with STH infection. ",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Patterns of salivary microbiota injury and oral mucositis in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Oral mucositis (OM) is a common debilitating dose-limiting toxicity of cancer

OM severity. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, metabolomic profiling, and
computational methods, we characterized the behavior of the salivary microbiome and
metabolome of 184 patients pre and post-HSCT. Pre-HSCT, Kingella, and Atopobium abundance
correlated with future development of severe OM. Post-transplant, Methylobacterium species
were significantly enriched in patients with severe OM. Moreover, the oral microbiome and
metabolome of severe OM patients underwent distinct changes during the week following
HSCT, compared to patients with no or mild OM. Changes in specific metabolites were well-
explained by microbial composition and the common metabolic pathway was the polyamines
pathway, which is essential for epithelial homeostasis. Together, our findings suggest that

In this project we will study dietary strategies based on high protein and dietary fibre (DF) to mitigate MeS and the risk for CVD in human subjects fulfilling the criteria for MeS. To obtain a more indepth knowledge we will use an obese porcine model, which allow more invasive exploration than in humans. In this model we will study the molecular consequences in adipose tissue and biofluids of development of obesity.

Acetate reprograms gut microbiota during alcohol consumption,"Liver damage due to chronic alcohol use is among the most prevalent liver diseases. Alcohol consumption frequency is a strong factor of microbiota variance. Here, we investigated whether changes are caused by ethanol metabolism by the gut microbiota. Although stable isotope labeled [1-13C] ethanol contributes to fatty acid pools in the liver, plasma, and cecum contents of mice, we found no evidence of ethanol metabolism by gut microbiota ex vivo under anaerobic conditions. Metatranscriptomics revealed that the gut microbiota responded to ethanol-feeding by activating acetate dissimilation, not by metabolizing ethanol directly. Blood acetate concentrations were elevated during ethanol consumption. Increasing systemic acetate levels with glyceryl triacetate supplementation did not affect liver disease, but induced similar gut microbiota alterations as chronic ethanol-feeding in mice. Our results suggest that ethanol is not directly metabolized by the gut microbiota, and changes in the gut microbiota linked to ethanol are actually a side effect of elevated acetate levels. De-trending for these acetate effects may be critical for understanding gut microbiota changes that cause alcohol-related liver disease, just as it has been shown in other diseases such as diabetes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioinformatics', 'Toxicology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Transfer of environmental microbes to the skin and respiratory tract of humans after urban green space exposure,"In industrialized countries, non-communicable diseases have been increasing in prevalence since the middle of the 20th century. While the causal mechanisms remain poorly understood, increased population density, pollution, sedentary behavior, smoking, changes in diet, and limited outdoor exposure have all been proposed as significant contributors. Several hypotheses (e.g. Hygiene, Old Friends, and Biodiversity Hypotheses) also suggest that limited environmental microbial exposures may underpin part of this rise in non-communicable diseases. In response, the Microbiome Rewilding Hypothesis proposes that adequate environmental microbial exposures could be achieved by restoring urban green spaces and could potentially decrease the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. However, the microbial interactions between humans and their surrounding environment and the passaging of microbes between both entities remains poorly understood, especially within an urban context. Here, we survey human skin (n = 90 swabs) and nasal (n = 90 swabs) microbiota of three subjects that were exposed to air (n = 15), soil (n = 15), and leaves (n = 15) from different urban green
space environments in three different cities across different continents (Adelaide, Australia; Bournemouth, United Kingdom; New Delhi, India). Using 16S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding, we examined baseline controls (pre-exposure) of both skin (n = 16) and nasal (n = 16) swabs and tracked microbiota transfer from the environment to the human body after exposure events. Microbial richness and phylogenetic diversity increased after urban green space exposure in skin and nasal samples collected in two of the three locations. The microbial composition of skin samples also became more similar to soil microbiota after exposure, while nasal samples became more similar to air samples. Nasal samples were more variable between sites and individuals than skin samples. We show that exposure to urban green spaces can increases skin and nasal microbial diversity and alters human microbiota composition. Our study improves our understanding of human-environmental microbial interactions and suggests that increased exposure to diverse outdoor environments

COVID19 Hospital,"Synergistic effects of bacteria on viral stability and transmission are widely documented but remain unclear in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We collected 972 samples from hospitalized ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and contextualized the massive microbial diversity in this dataset in a meta-analysis of over 20,000 samples. Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms were positive, with the highest prevalence in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples increasingly resembled the patient microbiome throughout their stay, SARS-CoV-2 was less frequently detected there (11%). Despite surface contamination in almost all patient rooms, no health care workers providing COVID-19 patient care contracted the disease. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity across human and surface samples, and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles allowed for high classifier accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 status in not only nares, but also forehead, stool and floor samples. Across these distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia was highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 across sample types, and had higher prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even when comparing to samples from patients in another intensive care unit prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that bacterial communities contribute to viral prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.

The mechanisms underlying these events have not been defined. This study assessed the association between the microbiome and weight gain in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast and gynecological cancers. Methods: patients were recruited before starting adjuvant therapy. Weight and height were measured before treatment and 4-6 weeks after treatment completion. Weight gain was defined as an increase of 3% or more in body weight. A stool sample was collected before treatment and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Data regarding oncological therapy, menopausal status and antibiotic use was prospectively collected. Patients were excluded if they were treated by antibiotics during the study. Results: thirty three patients were recruited, of them 9 gained 3.5 - 10.6 percent of baseline weight. The pretreatment microbiome of women who gained weight following treatment was significantly different in diversity and taxonomy from  that of control women. Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients that gained weight induced metabolic changes in germ free mice compared to mice transplanted with feces from the control women.

Exploring Organism-wide Changes in the Metabolome and Microbiome Following a Single Dose of Antibiotic,"Antibiotics are a mainstay of modern medicine, but as they kill their target pathogen(s), they often damage the commensal microbiota. Antibiotic-induced microbiome dysbiosis is a growing research focus and health concern, often assessed via analysis of fecal samples. However, such analysis does not inform how antibiotics influence the microbiome across the whole host, nor how such changes subsequently alter host chemistry. In this study, we investigated the acute (1 d post-administration), and delayed (6 d post-administration) effects of a single systemic dose of two common antibiotics, ampicillin or vancomycin, on the global metabolome and microbiome of mice across 77 different body sites from 25 different organs. The broader spectrum agent ampicillin had the greatest impact on the microbiota in the lower gastrointestinal tract (cecum and colon) where microbial diversity is highest. In the metabolome, the greatest effects were seen 1 d post-treatment, and changes in metabolite abundances were not confined to the gut. The local abundance of ampicillin and its metabolites correlated with increased metabolome effect size and a loss of alpha diversity vs. control mice. Additionally, small peptides were elevated in the lower gastrointestinal tract of 1 d post-antibiotic treated mice. While a single dose of systemic antibiotic did not drastically damage the microbiome, changes in the metabolome were nevertheless observed both within and outside the gut.

We found significant attenuation of weight and height gain during the first 6 years of life after neonatal antibiotic exposure in boys, but not in girls, after adjusting for potential confounders. Neonatal antibiotic exposure was associated with significant differences in the gut microbiome, particularly in decreased abundance and diversity of fecal Bifidobacteria until 2 years of age. Finally, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplant from antibiotic-exposed children to germ-free male, but not female mice resulted in significant growth impairment.

"Comparing DNA, RNA and protein levels for measuring microbial dynamics in soil microcosms amended with nitrogen fertilizer","To what extent multi-omic techniques could reflect in situ microbial process rates remains unclear, especially for highly diverse habitats like soils. Here, we performed microcosm incubations using sandy soil from an agricultural site in Midwest USA. Microcosms amended with isotopically labeled ammonium and urea to simulate a fertilization event showed nitrification (up to 4.1 ± 0.87 µg N-NO3− g−1 dry soil d−1) and accumulation of N2O after 192 hours of incubation. Nitrification activity (NH4+ → NH2OH → NO → NO2- → NO3−) was accompanied by a 6-fold increase in relative expression of the 16S rRNA gene (RNA/DNA) between 10 and 192 hours of incubation for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira, unlike archaea and comammox bacteria, which showed stable gene expression. A strong relationship between nitrification activity and betaproteobacterial ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase transcript abundances revealed that mRNA quantitatively reflected measured activity and was generally more sensitive than DNA under these conditions. Although peptides related to housekeeping proteins from nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms were detected, their abundance was not significantly correlated with activity, revealing that meta-proteomics provided only a qualitative assessment of activity. Altogether, these findings underscore the strengths and limitations of multi-omic approaches for assessing diverse microbial communities in soils and provide new insights into nitrification.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
High abundance and expression of transposases in bacteria from the Baltic Sea.,"Transposases are mobile genetic elements suggested to have an important role in bacterial genome plasticity and host adaptation but their transcriptional activity in natural bacterial communities is largely unexplored. Here we analyzed metagenomes and -transcriptomes of size fractionated (0.1-0.8, 0.8-3.0 and 3.0-200 μm) bacterial communities from the brackish Baltic Sea, and adjacent marine waters. The Baltic Sea transposase levels, up to 1.7% of bacterial genes and 2% of bacterial transcripts, were considerably higher than in marine waters and similar to levels reported for extreme environments. Large variations in expression were found between transposase families and groups of bacteria, with a two-fold higher transcription in Cyanobacteria than in any other phylum. The community-level results were corroborated at the genus level by Synechococcus transposases reaching up to 5.2% of genes and 6.9% of transcripts, which is in contrast to marine Synechococcus that largely lack these genes. Levels peaked in Synechococcus from the largest size fraction, suggesting high frequencies of lateral gene transfer and high genome plasticity in colony-forming picocyanobacteria. Together, the results support an elevated rate of transposition-based genome change and adaptation in bacterial populations of the Baltic Sea, and possibly also of other highly dynamic estuarine waters.",gpt-3.5-turbo,{'Metagenomics'},"{'Transposases', 'Bacterial communities'}"
Molecular profiling of tissue biopsies reveals unique signatures associated with streptococcal necrotizing soft tissue infections,"Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are devastating infections caused by either a single pathogen, predominantly Streptococcus pyogenes, or by multiple bacterial species. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these different NSTI types could facilitate faster diagnostic and more effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrate microbial community profiling with host and pathogen(s) transcriptional analysis in patient biopsies to dissect the pathophysiology of streptococcal and polymicrobial NSTIs. We observe that the pathogenicity of polymicrobial communities is mediated by synergistic interactions between community members, fueling a cycle of bacterial colonization and inflammatory tissue destruction. In S. pyogenes NSTIs, expression of specialized virulence factors underlies infection pathophysiology. Furthermore, we identify a strong interferon-related response specific to S. pyogenes NSTIs that could be exploited as a potential diagnostic biomarker.

Stool samples were collected from 113 patients with BD, 39 unaffected first-degree relatives and 77 healthy individuals and the microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
RESULTS:
The gut microbiota community membership of patients with BD differed from that of healthy individuals (R2 = 1.0%, P = 0.008), whereas the community membership of unaffected first-degree relatives did not. Flavonifractor was present in 61% of patients with BD, 42% of their unaffected relatives and 39% of healthy individuals. Presence of Flavonifractor was associated with an odds ratio of 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6-5.2, P = 5.8 × 10-4, Q = 0.036) for having BD. When excluding smokers, presence of Flavonifractor was associated with an odds ratio of 2.3 (95%CI: 1.1-5.3, P = 0.019) for having BD. However, when considering the subsample of non-smokers only, BD and presence of Flavonifractor were no longer associated when adjusted for all possible tests at genus level (Q = 0.6). Presence of Flavonifractor in patients with BD was associated with smoking and female sex, but not with age, waist circumference, exercise level, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, current affective state, subtype of BD, illness duration or psychotropic medication, respectively.
CONCLUSION:
Flavonifractor, a bacterial genus that may induce oxidative stress and inflammation in its host, was associated with BD. Higher prevalence of smoking among patients with BD contributed to our findings, and it cannot be excluded that findings are influenced by residual confounding.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Psychiatry', 'Microbiology', 'Medicine'}",set()

"Diversity of the oral fungal biofilm, and its associations with oral bacteria and periodontitis among high-risk Hispanic communities",". We aim to characterize the bacterial and fungal oral communities of the participants, according to periodontal disease severity, while associating it with other variables such as lifestyle and clinical history of patients. Participants will provide saliva samples for oral microbiome analysis and full-mouth periodontal examination will be performed following the NHANES protocol. Periodontitis will be defined according to the Centers for Disease Control/American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP). Socio-demographic, behavioral, dental, and medical characteristics will be collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Other risk factors for oral cancer will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology. In depth research on the oral microbiome in high-risk Hispanics is essential for the development of prevention and treatment strategies.

Delayed Establishment of Gut Microbiota in Infants Delivered by Cesarean Section,"The maternal vaginal microbiome is an important source for infant gut microbiome development. However, infants delivered by Cesarean section (CS) do not contact the maternal vaginal microbiome and this delivery method may perturb the early establishment and development of the gut microbiome. The aim of this study was to investigate the early gut microbiota of Korean newborns receiving the same postpartum care services for two weeks after birth by delivery mode using fecal samples collected at days 3, 7, and 14. Early gut microbiota development patterns were examined using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing from 132 infants either born vaginally (VD, n = 64) or via Cesarean section (CS, n = 68). VD-born neonates showed increased alpha diversity in infant fecal samples collated at days 7 and 14 compared to those from day 3, while those of CS infants did not differ (p < 0.015). Bacterial structures of infants from both groups separated at day 7 (p < 0.001) and day 14 (p < 0.01). The bacterial structure of VD infants gradually changed over time (day 3 vs. day 7, p < 0.012; day 3 vs. day 14, p < 0.001). Day 14 samples of CS infants differed from day 3 and 7 samples (day 3 vs. day 14, p < 0.001). VD infant relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (days 7, 14), Bacteroides (days 7, 14), and Lachnospiraceae (day 7) significantly increased compared to CS infants, with a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (found in all periods of the CS group) (LDA > 3.0). Relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus were significantly increased in both VD and CS groups at day 14 (LDA > 3.0). Predicted functional analysis showed that VD infants had overrepresented starch/sucrose, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in gut microbiota with depleted lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis until day 14 compared to CS infants. This study confirmed that delivery mode is the major determinant of neonatal intestinal microbiome establishment and provides a profile of microbiota perturbations in CS infants.

Feasibility of using alternative swabs and storage solutions for paired SARS-CoV-2 detection and microbiome analysis in the hospital environment,"Since its appearance in early December of 2019, COVID-19 has continued to be a growing pandemic and the United States and European nations in particular have experienced unprecedented, dramatic tolls on their economy. As the push continues to re-open economies, the needs for containment, increased testing, and contact tracing of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 remain essential. Despite the large scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty persists regarding the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted.  Determining the role of fomites in the transmission of COVID-19 is essential in the hospital setting and will likely be important outside of medical facilities as governments around the world make plans to ease COVID-19 public health restrictions and attempt to safely reopen economies. Expanding COVID-19 testing to include environmental surfaces both in the hospital environment and out-of-hospital setting would ideally be performed with inexpensive swabs which could be transported safely without the fear of being a source of new infections. However,  clinical-grade sampling supplies are expensive and challenging to deploy at population-wide scales.   To this end, we performed a series of experiments evaluating and comparing the diagnostic yield of various consumer grade swabs stored in 95% ethanol rather than viral transport medium to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the environment from twenty hospital rooms that housed COVID-19 patients.

Functional potential of plastic-associated microorganisms,"Plastics exposed to the marine environment are rapidly colonised by diverse microbial communities, which can potentially influence the biological and physicochemical interaction of plastics with the surroundings and their ecotoxicological properties. Factors affecting the composition and metabolic functioning of plastic-associated microbial communities (plastisphere) are poorly understood, especially with regard to whether different microbial communities systematically colonize different plastics. In this study, we employed a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the role of substrate type on plastisphere composition and functional role. Microbes associated with plastics were taxonomically distinct from the surrounding picoplankton. Genes required to adapt to a surface-associated lifestyle were enriched on the surface: functional analysis revealed a higher abundance of antibiotic and metal resistance genes associated with different plastics, and genes associated with horizontal gene transfer, quorum sensing, responses to oxidative stress and xenobiotic degradation were enriched on all plastics. Our results therefore indicate that plastisphere communities have the potential to influence the fate of marine plastics by harbouring specific microorganisms and genes that alter biodegradation. The selective enrichment of antimicrobial and toxic compound resistance genes on plastics also raises concern for unexpected impacts of plastics on the marine ecosystem.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
The microbiome of fly organs and fly-human microbial transfer during decomposition,"During decomposition, flies interact with the remains to lay eggs and acquire nutrients, and in the process, they bring their microbes with them. While it is known that flies have their own unique core microbiome, it is not known if flies associated with human cadavers have a different core microbiome. Differences in the fly microbiome may influence the types of microbes transmitted from the flies to the cadaver, therefore po
tentially affecting assembly of the human decomposer microbiome. The first purpose of this study was to characterize the microbiome of flies associated with human cadavers by fly organ and season. This is
cause fly interactions with cadavers vary by season, and because it is likely that external fly organs [i.e., the labellum and tarsi] make more direct contact and are likely involved in increased mechanical transmission with the cadaver than internal organs such as the oocyte. The second purpose of this study was to
termine if the fly microbes contribute to the human decomposer microbiome. To accomplish these aims, 10 human cadavers were placed outdoors across three seasons and allowed to decompose. A total of 40 flies that landed on the cadaver were collected and dissected by the labellum, tarsi, and oocyte. In addition to fly collections, samples from the cadavers were collected using a sterile swab at sites including the cheek of the face, inner cheek, bicep, torso, and anus. Overall, it was shown that flies associated with human cadavers have a similar microbiome to flies from previous studies that were not associated with human cadavers. However, there are differences in the microbiome between seasons and fly parts. We also show evidence that flies act as a microbial source to the human decomposer microbiome, which is important for

MERITS WP4/5,"There is an alarming rise in the frequency of metabolic syndrome (MeS), which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) two-fold and type 2 diabetes (T2D) five-fold. Easy access to energy dense, unhealthy foods is a key factor responsible for this development. In this project we will study dietary strategies based on high protein and dietary fibre (DF) to mitigate MeS and the risk for CVD in human subjects fulfilling the criteria for MeS. To obtain a more indepth knowledge we will use an obese porcine model, which allow more invasive exploration than in humans. In this model we will study the molecular consequences in adipose tissue and biofluids of development of obesity. Furthermore, preadipocytes from pigs and humans will be isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies to examine the extent to which the different diets influence proliferation and differentiation processes relevant to the expandability potential. Dietary intervention strategies with protein and DF will be developed in collaboration with the involved food and ingredient industries and used in studies in humans with MeS and obese pigs. The protein sources will be bioactive dairy and vegetable proteins and the DF sources will be rich in soluble and insoluble arabinoxylan known to modulate the digestion and absorption processes in the small and large intestine. We will obtain specific knowledge on the interaction and effects of bioactive proteins and DF on postprandial lipaemia, appetite, responses of inflammatory markers, body composition, adipocytes and microbiota in subjects with MeS and obese pigs as well as clarifying the effect of pre-meals of different amounts and qualities of protein on postprandial lipaemia in humans.

Physical activity shapes the intestinal microbiome and immunity of healthy mice but has no protective effects against colitis in Muc2-/- mice,"The interactions among humans, their environment, and the trillions of microbes residing within the human intestinal tract form a tripartite relationship that is fundamental to the overall health of the host. Disruptions in the delicate balance between the intestinal microbiota and their host immunity are implicated in various chronic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is no known cure for IBD, therefore, novel therapeutics targeting prevention and symptoms management are of great interest. Recently, physical activity in healthy mice was shown to be protective against chemically induced colitis, however the benefits of physical activity during or following disease onset is not known. In this study, we examine whether voluntary wheel running is protective against primary disease symptoms in a mucin 2 deficient (Muc2-/-) life-long model of murine colitis. We show that 6 weeks of wheel running in healthy C57BL/6 mice leads to distinct changes in fecal bacteriome, increased butyrate production, and modulation in colonic gene expression of various cytokines, suggesting an overall primed anti-inflammatory state. However, these physical activity-derived benefits are not present in Muc2-/- mice harboring a dysfunctional mucosal layer from birth, ultimately showing no improvements in clinical signs. We extrapolate from our findings that while physical activity in healthy individuals may be an important preventative measure against IBD, for those with a compromised intestinal mucosa, a commonality in IBD patients, these benefits are lost.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()

Systems analysis of gut microbiome influence on metabolic disease in HIV and high-risk populations,"Poor metabolic health, characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, is higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) and has been linked with chronic inflammation, some anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, and ART-associated lipodystrophy (LD). Metabolic disease has been associated with gut microbiome composition outside the context of HIV but has not been deeply explored in the context of HIV infection nor in high-risk men who have sex with men (HR-MSM), who have a highly altered gut microbiome composition. Furthermore, the potential contribution of increased bacterial translocation and associated systemic inflammation that has been described in HIV-positive and HR-MSM individuals has not been explored. We used a multi-omic approach to explore relationships between gut microbes, immune phenotypes, diet, and metabolic health across HIV-positive, ART-treated individuals with and without LD; untreated HIV-positive individuals; and HR-MSM. For HIV-positive individuals on ART, we further explored associations with the plasma metabolome. Sixtey-nine measures of diet, gut microbes, inflammation, and demographics were associated with impaired metabolic health defined using fasting blood markers including lipids, glucose and hormones. We found plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) as the most important predictor of metabolic disease in HIV-infected and HR-MSM. LBP also strongly correlated with several other microbial, diet, and immune predictors of metabolic disease. Our results suggest a central role of inflammatory processes linked with bacterial translocation (measured by LBP) and interaction with dietary components and the gut microbiome in metabolic disease among HIV-infected and HR-MSM.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Immunology', 'Metabolomics'}",set()
Microbial biogeography of public restroom surfaces,"We spend the majority of our lives indoors where we are constantly exposed to bacteria residing on surfaces. However, the diversity of these surface-associated communities is largely unknown. We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Public health and epidemiology'}",set()
Endophytic fungal microbiome of wheat,"genotype, presence of fungi in the environment, and abiotic factors in shaping the plant microbiome is of significance for modern agriculture, with implications in disease management, breeding, and development of biocontrol agents.
We conducted a large-scale pot experiment with related wheat cultivars over one growth-season, to disentangle the effects of host genotype, environment, and fungi present in seed stock, air and soil on endophytic fungal communities in roots, leaves and seeds. We studied communities with metabarcoding and monitored abiotic factors during the experimental period.
Host genotype, tissue and abiotic factors influenced fungal communities significantly. The effect of host genetic control was limited to leaves and roots and location-independent; relatedness between cultivars was not reflected in the microbiome. For the phyllosphere, abiotic factors largely explained differences in abundance, diversity, and presence of pathogens between the locations, while the rhizosphere communities were less affected by abiotic factors. We found indications that airborne fungi are the primary inoculum source for above-ground fungal communities.

Resistant starch type 2 from wheat improves glycemic response with concurrent alterations in gut microbiota composition,"The majority of research on the physiological effects of dietary resistant starch type 2 (RS2) has focused on sources derived from high-amylose maize. In this study, we conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial investigating the effects of RS2 from wheat on glycemic response, an important indicator of metabolic health, and the gut microbiota. Overall, RS2-enriched wheat provided in a standard breakfast meal resulted in reduced postprandial glucose and insulin responses relative to conventional wheat. This was accompanied by an increase in the proportions of bacterial taxa Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Roseburia. Additionally, Faecalibacterium, Ruminoccocus, Roseburia, and Barnesiellaceae were correlated with enrichment of butyrate and SCFAs, which were in turn correlated with glycemic response. These effects suggest that RS2-enriched wheat may improve metabolic indices and reduce risk of metabolic disease compared to regular wheat and that the gut microbiome may play a role in mediating the individual’s metabolic response.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Obesity-related Metabolome and Gut Microbiota Profiles of Juvenile Gottingen Minipigs Long-term Intake of Fructose and Resistant Starch,"Multi-compartmental metabolome and gut microbiota responses to a long-term intervention diet were investigated in a juvenile Göttingen minipig model. A high-risk (HR) diet containing 20% fructose was compared to a control low-risk (LR  ) diet where a similar amount was provided as a mix of digestible and resistant starch from high amylose maize. Both diets contained high levels of fat and were fed ad libitum. Liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) non-targeted metabolomics was used to explore plasma, urine, and feces samples over five months. Plasma and fecal short-chain fatty acids were quantified using LC-MS and gas chromatography, respectively. 16S rDNA sequencing was used for fecal microbiota analysis. The data was analyzed using sparse multi-block partial least squares regression. The LR diet lead to high concentrations of fecal and plasma total short-chain fatty acids, primarily acetate, and a higher relative abundance microbiota associated with acetate production   such as Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcus. A higher proportion of Firmicutes was measured with the HR diet, together with a lower alpha diversity compared to the LR diet.

"Host biology, ecology and the environment influence microbial biomass and diversity in 101 marine fish species","Fish are the most diverse and widely distributed vertebrates, yet little is known about the microbial ecology of fishes nor the biological and environmental factors that influence fish microbiota.

We compare alpha, beta and gamma diversity while establishing a method to estimate microbial biomass associated with these host surfaces. We show that body site is the strongest driver of microbial diversity while microbial biomass and diversity is lowest in the gill of larger, pelagic fishes. Patterns of phylosymbiosis are observed across the gill, skin and hindgut. In a quantitative synthesis of vertebrate hindguts (569 species), we also show that mammals have the highest gamma diversity when controlling for host species number while fishes have the highest percent of unique microbial taxa.

Architectural design influences the diversity and structure of the built environment microbiome,"Buildings are complex ecosystems that house trillions of microorganisms interacting with each other, with humans and with their environment. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine the diversity and composition of the built environment microbiome the community of microorganisms that live indoors is important for understanding the relationship between building design, biodiversity and human health. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to quantify relationships between building attributes and airborne bacterial communities at a health-care facility. We quantified airborne bacterial community structure and environmental conditions in patient rooms exposed to mechanical or window ventilation and in outdoor air. The phylogenetic diversity of airborne bacterial communities was lower indoors than outdoors, and mechanically ventilated rooms contained less diverse microbial communities than did window-ventilated rooms. Bacterial communities in indoor environments contained many taxa that are absent or rare outdoors, including taxa closely related to potential human pathogens. Building attributes, specifically the source of ventilation air, airflow rates, relative humidity and temperature, were correlated with the diversity and composition of indoor bacterial communities. The relative abundance of bacteria closely related to human pathogens was higher indoors than outdoors, and higher in rooms with lower airflow rates and lower relative humidity.

Effects of extended postmortem interval on microbial communities in organs of the human cadaver,"Human thanatomicrobiota studies have shown that microorganisms inhabit and

the thanatomicrobiome or the underlying factors leading to delayed decomposition
exhibited by reproductive organs. The use of the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial
16S rRNA gene sequences for taxonomic classification (“barcoding”) and phylogenetic
analyses of human postmortem microbiota has recently emerged as a possible tool
in forensic microbiology. The goal of this study was to apply a 16S rRNA barcoding
approach to investigate variation among different organs, as well as the extent to which
microbial associations among different body organs in human cadavers can be used
to predict forensically important determinations, such as cause and time of death. We
assessed microbiota of organ tissues including brain, heart, liver, spleen, prostate, and
uterus collected at autopsy from criminal casework of 40 Italian cadavers with times of
death ranging from 24 to 432 h. Both the uterus and prostate had a significantly higher
alpha diversity compared to other anatomical sites, and exhibited a significantly different
microbial community composition from non-reproductive organs, which we found to
be dominated by the bacterial orders MLE1-12, Saprospirales, and Burkholderiales.
In contrast, reproductive organs were dominated by Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and
showed a marked decrease in relative abundance of MLE1-12. These results provide
insight into the observation that the uterus and prostate are the last internal organs to
decay during human decomposition. We conclude that distinct community profiles of

A multiomics study on the effects of TRIKAFTA on CF patients,"Novel small molecule therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) are showing promising efficacy and becoming more widely available since recent FDA approval. The newest of these, Trikafta (TKT), is a triple therapy utilizing Ivacaftor, a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, combined with Tezacaftor and Elexacaftor, CFTR correctors.  However, it is not yet known how these drugs will affect polymicrobial lung infections, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with CF (pwCF). Here, we analyzed the sputum microbiome and metabolome from pwCF (n=24) before and after TKT therapy using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The lung microbiome diversity, particularly its evenness, was increased (p = 0.044) and the microbiome profiles were different between individuals before and after therapy (PERMANOVA F=1.92, p=0.044). Despite these changes, the microbiomes were more similar within an individual than across the sampled population. There were no specific microbial taxa that were different in abundance before and after therapy, but collectively, the log-ratio of anaerobes to pathogens significantly decreased. The sputum metabolome also showed changes due to TKT. Beta-diversity increased after therapy (PERMANOVA F=4.22, p=0.022) and was characterized by greater variation across subjects while on treatment. This significant difference in the metabolome was driven by a decrease in peptides, amino acids, and metabolites from the kynurenine pathway. Metabolism of the three small molecules that make up TKT was extensive, including previously uncharacterized structural modifications. This study shows that TKT therapy affects both the microbiome and metabolome of airway mucus. This effect was stronger on sputum biochemistry, which may reflect changing niche spaces for microbial residency in lung mucus as the drug’s effects take hold, which then leads to changing microbiology.Why: exploratory study, not much is known about TRIKAFTA’s impact on microbiome/metabolome of CF lung

The gut microbiota modulates environmental risk for cognitive impairment,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a prevalent neurological condition characterized deficient attention, causal reasoning, learning and/or memory. Many genetic and environmental factors increase risk for CI, and the gut microbiome is increasingly implicated. However, the identity of gut microbes associated with CI risk, their effects on CI, and their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we examine the gut microbiome in response to restricted diet and intermittent hypoxia, known environmental risk factors for CI. Modeling the environmental factors together in mice potentiates CI and alters the gut microbiota. Depleting the microbiome by antibiotic treatment or germ-free rearing prevents the adverse effects of environmental risk on CI, whereas transplantation of the risk-associated microbiome into naïve mice confers CI. Parallel sequencing and gnotobiotic approaches identify the pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia as enriched by the environmental risk factors for CI and as sufficient to induce CI. Consistent with CI-related behavioral abnormalities, B. wadsworthia and the risk-associated microbiome disrupt hippocampal activity, neurogenesis and gene expression. The CI induced by B. wadsworthia and by environmental risk factors is associated with microbiome-dependent increases in intestinal IFNy-producing Th1 cells. Inhibiting Th1 cells abrogates the adverse effects of both B. wadsworthia and environmental risk factors on CI.

Obesity is significantly associated with a reduction in SCFA concentration, microbial diversity and SCFA synthesizing bacteria. Country of origin can be accurately predicted from the fecal microbiota while the predictive accuracy for obesity is inversely correlated to the epidemiological transition, being greatest in Ghana.

CMT also protected against perturbed metabolites and normalized innate and adaptive immune effectors. CMT restored major patterns of ileal microRNA and histone regulation of gene expression. Further experiments suggest a gut-microbiota-regulated T1D protection mechanism centered on Reg3g, in an innate intestinal immune network involving CD44, TLR2, and Reg3g.

Here, we investigated the influence of vegetation complexity (i.e., diversity and structure) on soil bacterial communities in urban green spaces around the world. By sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 gene region, we assessed the bacterial diversity of urban green space soils in Bournemouth, UK; Haikou, China; and the City of Playford, Australia. We characterized these urban green spaces as having ‘high’ or ‘low’ vegetation complexity. We then explored whether urban green spaces of these two broad categories around the world contained similar bacterial taxonomy or levels of diversity. Soil bacterial genera were significantly different between cities, however; within cities soil bacterial genera were significantly different in alpha and beta diversity between vegetation complexities. Furthermore, rare genera (those < 1 % relative abundance) were most likely to be significantly different in abundance between vegetation complexities and thus drove many of the community differences. Overall, general trends exist between cities in our study. However, given the uniqueness of a particular cities climate, geography, and existing design, embedded experiments within new green space designs will be required to provide local adaptation to conserving and restoring microbial diversity within each city.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biodiversity'}",set()

Altered gut microbial profile is associated with abnormal metabolism activity of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To enhance the understanding of the gut microbiota structure in ASD children at different ages as well as the relationship between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used the 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the gut microbial population in a cohort of 143 children aged 2-13 years old. We found that the α-diversity of ASD group showed no significant change with age, while the TD group showed increased α-diversity with age, which indicates that the compositional development of the gut microbiota in ASD varies at different ages in ways that are not consistent with TD group. Recent studies have shown that chronic constipation is one of the most commonly obvious gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms along with ASD core symptoms. To further investigate the potential interaction effects between ASD and GI symptoms, the 30 C-ASD and their aged-matched TD were picked out to perform metagenomics analysis. We observed that C-ASD group displayed decreased diversity, depletion of species of Sutterella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities, which may involve in the pathogenesis of C-ASD. Consistent with metagenomic analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed some of the differential metabolites between C-ASD and TD group were involved in the metabolic network of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, histidine, and GABA. Furthermore, we found these differences in metabolites were associated with altered abundance of specific bacteria. The study suggested possible future modalities for ASD intervention through targeting the specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioinformatics', 'Microbiology', 'Metabolomics'}",set()

Temporal dynamics in Bacterial community of Hydra polyps after hatching,"Animals are colonized by complex bacterial communities. The processes controlling community membership and influencing the establishment of the microbial ecosystem during development are poorly understood. Here we aim to explore the assembly of bacterial communities in Hydra with the broader goal of elucidating the general rules which determine the temporal progression of bacterial colonization of animal epithelia. We profiled the microbial communities in polyps at various time points after hatching in four replicates. The composition and temporal patterns of the bacterial communities were strikingly similar in all replicates. Distinct features include high diversity of community profiles in the first week, a remarkable but transient adult-like profile two weeks after hatching, followed by progressive emergence of a stable adult-like pattern characterized by low species diversity and the preponderance of the ??-Proteobacterium Curvibacter. Intriguingly, this process displayed important parallels to the assembly of human fecal communities after birth. In addition, a mathematical modeling approach was included to uncover the organizational principles of this colonization process, suggesting that both local environmental or host-derived factor(s) modulating the colonization rate as well as frequency-dependent interactions of individual bacterial community members are important aspects in the emergence of a stable bacterial community at the end of development.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Animal study'}",set()
Gut Bacteria Shared by Children and Their Mothers Associate with Developmental Level and Social Deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"The gut microbiota of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children differs from that of children without ASD. The maternal gut microbiota impacts offspring gut microbiota. However, the relationship between the development of ASD and gut bacteria shared between children and their mothers remains elusive. Our study recruited 76 children with ASD and 47 age- and gender-matched children with typi- cal development (TD), as well as the mothers of both groups, and investigated their gut microbiota using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The gut microbiota of ASD children was altered compared with that of children with TD, while no significant alterations were found in their mothers. We established 30 gut bacterial coabun- dance groups (CAGs) and found the relative abundances of CAG15 and CAG16 sig- nificantly decreased in ASD children. CAG15 showed a positive correlation with de- velopmental level. The proportion of ASD children who shared either one of the two Lachnospiraceae ASVs from CAG15 with their mothers was significantly lower than that of children with TD. Moreover, we found that CAG12, CAG13, and CAG18 nega- tively correlated with the severity of social deficits in ASD children. ASD children who shared any one of the four (two Ruminococcaceae, one Lachnospiraceae, and one Collinsella) ASVs in CAG13 and CAG18 with their mothers showed a lower level of social deficits than ASD children that did not share those with their mothers. These data demonstrate that these shared gut bacteria in ASD children are associ- ated with their developmental level and social deficits. This work provides a new direction toward understanding the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and development of ASD.

Impact of zinc deficiency on Group B Streptococcal colonization and the vaginal microbiome,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in the vaginal tract is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. GBS colonization is transient in nature, likely reflecting contributions of pathogen determinants, interactions with commensal flora, and host factors, making this environment particularly challenging to understand. Zinc deficiency is a global concern largely associated with preterm birth but the impact of zinc deficiency on vaginal health has not been studied. Here we use a murine model of GBS vaginal colonization to assess the role of dietary zinc deficiency on GBS burden and impacts on the vaginal microbiome. We show vaginal community turnover during GBS colonization that is driven by computationally predictable changes in key taxa. We identified that Akkermansia muciniphila impacts GBS murine colonization and is associated with birth outcome in a human cohort.

Daily Caloric Restriction and Intermittent Fasting Trial (DRIFT2) Microbiome,"The interplay between epigenetics and gut microbiota (MB) has been poorly studied in any disease context, and both may play important - and potentially causal - roles in obesity and related conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is essential to increase our understanding of the individual and composite effects of epigenetics and MB on obesity and weight loss. The primary objective of this study is to investigate epigenetic and MB profiles in a healthy obese population undergoing a weight loss intervention of daily caloric restriction (DCR) or intermittent fasting (IMF). IMF is a promising approach to weight loss and emerging research suggests IMF may be more effective than DCR at reducing and maintaining body weight due to beneficial impacts on hormones related to satiety and improved energy expenditure. Blood and stool samples will be collected at baseline and 3 months from 60 subjects enrolled in a behavioral weight loss trial comparing DCR to IMF. Our primary hypothesis is that changes in epigenetic and MB profiles in response to DCR and IMF will be differentially associated with weight loss and markers of CVD. This study will examine the interplay between epigenetics and MB in the context of comparing a traditional weight loss approach of DCR to IMF, which is less studied and may offer promise for enhanced weight loss maintenance and cardiovascular health benefits.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Epigenetics'}","{'Microbiome', 'Obesity'}"
The Gastrointestinal and Microbiome Impact of a Resistant Starch Blend: A Randomized Clinical Trial Using Smart Caps ,"The gastrointestinal (GI) impact of resistant starch consumption depends on microbiomes, adherence, and various types and amounts of resistant starch. A randomized clinical trial with smart cap monitoring was used to evaluate the GI impact of a novel resistant starch blend (RSB) at varying doses. The study design randomized participants to a potato starch as a control or one of three arms ramping doses from 10 to 30 g /day over 6 weeks of RSB, a proprietary mixture of a different potato starch, green banana flour and apple fiber powder. The blend contained at least 50% resistant starch. Total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) increased with increasing doses of the RSB. GI symptoms improved in all groups, and the increasing doses of RSB led to a decrease in the diarrhea score. Using an estimate of total consumption of RSB based on smart cap recordings of container openings and protocol-specified doses, we showed that a reduction in the sleep disturbance score was associated with higher RSB dose. The microbiome evaluation demonstrated that among the 16S sequences most associated with the consumption of the novel blend RSB, two belong to taxa of notable interest to human health: Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Gastroenterology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Carbohydrates'}",{'Microbiome'}
Gut Microbial Dysbiosis in Indian Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a term associated with a group of neurodevelopmental disorders. The etiology of ASD is not yet completely understood; however, a disorder in the gut-brain axis is emerging as a prominent factor leading to autism. To identify the taxonomic composition and markers associated with ASD, we compared the fecal microbiota of 30 ASD children diagnosed using Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, DSM-5 approved AIIMS-modified INCLEN Diagnostic Tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (INDT-ASD), and Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA) tool, with family-matched 24 healthy children from Indian population using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicon. Our study showed prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of ASD children, with higher relative abundances of families Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteraceae, and Veillonellaceae, whereas the gut microbiome of healthy children was dominated by the family Prevotellaceae. Comparative meta-analysis with a publicly available dataset from the US population consisting of 20 ASD and 20 healthy control samples from children of similar age, revealed a significantly high abundance of genus Lactobacillus in ASD children from both the populations.

Methods: Healthy males (n = 6) and females (n = 5) (33.4 ± 7.7 years, 174.1 ± 12.0 cm, 76.5 ± 12.9 kg, 25.2 ± 3.1 kg/m2, n = 11) completed two supplementation protocols that each spanned three weeks separated by a washout period that lasted two weeks. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion, participants ingested a daily dose of GLU hydrochloride (3,000mg GlucosaGreen®, TSI Group Ltd., USA) or maltodextrin placebo. Study participants completed bowel habit and gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire in addition to provide a stool sample that was analyzed for fecal microbiota and metabolome at baseline and after the completion of each supplementation period. Results: GLU significantly reduced stomach bloating and showed a trend towards reducing constipation and hard stools. Alpha diversity of the bacterial communities in the fecal contents was significantly decreased following GLU consumption compared to baseline values. GLU supplementation significantly reduced individual and total branched-chain amino acid, and total amino acid excretion, with no glucosamine being detected in any of the fecal samples.

Assessing saliva microbiome collection and processing methods,"The oral microbiome has been connected with lung health and may be of significance in the progression of SARS-CoV2 infection. Saliva-based SARS-CoV2 tests provide the opportunity to leverage stored samples for assessing the oral microbiome. However, these collection kits have not been tested for accuracy of measuring the oral microbiome. Saliva is highly enriched with human DNA and reducing it prior to shotgun sequencing may increase the depth of bacterial reads. We examined both the effect of saliva collection method and sequence processing on measurement of microbiome depth and diversity by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We collected 56 samples from 22 subjects. Each subject provided two saliva samples with and without preservative; six subjects provided a second set of samples the following day. 16S rRNA gene (V4) sequencing was performed on all samples, and shotgun metagenomics was performed on eight samples collected with preservative with and without human DNA depletion before sequencing. We observed that the beta diversity distances within subjects over time was smaller than between unrelated subjects, and distances within subjects were smaller in samples collected with preservative. Samples collected with preservative had higher alpha diversity measuring both richness and evenness. Human DNA depletion before extraction and shotgun sequencing yielded higher total and relative reads mapping to bacterial sequences. We conclude that collecting saliva with preservative may give more consistent measures of the oral microbiome and depleting human DNA increases yield of bacterial sequences.

To address these questions and to test whether our past observations linking SARS-CoV-2 abundance to Rothia sp. in hospitals also hold in a residential setting, we performed a detailed spatial sampling of three isolation housing units, assessing each sample for SARS-CoV-2 abundance by RT-qPCR, linking the results to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences (to assess the bacterial community at each location), and to the Cq value of the contemporaneous clinical test. Our results showed that the highest SARS-CoV-2 load in this setting is on touched surfaces, such as light switches and faucets, but a detectable signal was present in many untouched surfaces (e.g., floors) that may be more relevant in settings, such as schools where mask-wearing is enforced.

Unique features of the gut microbiome characterized in animal models of Angelman Syndrome,"A large subset of patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) suffer from concurrent gastrointestinal (GI) issues, including constipation, poor feeding, and reflux. AS is caused by the loss of ubiquitin ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene expression in the brain. Clinical features of AS, which include developmental delays, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and seizures, are primarily due to the deficient expression or function of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele. The association between neurodevelopmental delay and GI disorders is part of the increasing evidence suggesting a link between the brain and the gut microbiome via the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. To investigate the associations between colonization of the gut microbiota in AS, we characterized the fecal microbiome in three animal models of AS containing maternal deletions of Ube3A, including mouse, rat, and pig, using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Overall changes in the microbial composition of all three animal models of AS in both the phylum and genus levels of bacterial abundance were identified. Specific bacterial groups were significantly increased across all animal models, including: Lachnospiraceae Incertae sedis, Desulfovibrios sp., and Odoribacter, which have been correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Taken together, these findings suggest that specific changes to the local environment in the gut are driven by a Ube3a maternal deletion, unaffected by varying housing conditions and are prominent and detectable across multiple small and large model species. These findings may begin to uncover the underlying mechanistic causes of GI disorders in AS patients and provide future therapeutic options for AS patients.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Animal study'}",set()

Oral Infections Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study - subgingival plaque wave 2,"	Periodontitis affects up to 50% of individuals worldwide [1], and 8.5% are diagnosed with diabetes [2]. The high-comorbidity rate of these diseases may suggest, at least in part, a shared etiology and pathophysiology. Changes in oral microbial communities have been documented in the context of severe periodontitis and diabetes, both independently and together. However, much less is known about the early oral microbial markers of these diseases. We used a subset of the ORIGINS project dataset, which collected detailed periodontal and cardiometabolic information from 787 healthy individuals, to identify early microbial markers of periodontitis and its association with markers of cardiometabolic health. Using state-of-the-art compositional data analysis tools, we identified the log ratio of Treponema to Corynebacterium bacteria to be a novel Microbial Indicator of Periodontitis (MIP), and found that this MIP correlates with poor periodontal health and cardiometabolic markers early in disease pathogenesis in both subgingival plaque and saliva.

Pan-cancer whole genome (WGS) microbiome analyses of metastatic solid tumors,"Metastatic cancer is a major cause of death and is associated with poor treatment efficacy. A better understanding of the characteristics of late-stage cancer is required to help adapt personalized treatments, reduce overtreatment and improve outcomes. Here we describe the largest, to our knowledge, pan-cancer study of metastatic solid tumour genomes, including whole-genome sequencing data for 2,520 pairs of tumour and normal tissue, analysed at median depths of 106× and 38×, respectively, and surveying more than 70 million somatic variants. The characteristic mutations of metastatic lesions varied widely, with mutations that reflect those of the primary tumour types, and with high rates of whole-genome duplication events (56%). Individual metastatic lesions were relatively homogeneous, with the vast majority (96%) of driver mutations being clonal and up to 80% of tumour-suppressor genes being inactivated bi-allelically by different mutational mechanisms. Although metastatic tumour genomes showed similar mutational landscape and driver genes to primary tumours, we find characteristics that could contribute to responsiveness to therapy or resistance in individual patients. We implement an approach for the review of clinically relevant associations and their potential for actionability. For 62% of patients, we identify genetic variants that may be used to stratify patients towards therapies that either have been approved or are in clinical trials.

Changes in intestinal microbiota in postmenopausal oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy,"Previous pre-clinical research has indicated that the intestinal microbiota can potentiate anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and that chemotherapy can affect intestinal microbiota. Using a longitudinal design, this clinical study explored the associations between the intestinal microbiota, chemotherapy toxicity, and treatment response in postmenopausal oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients.
Forty-four postmenopausal breast cancer patients with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer were prospectively enrolled in a multicentre cohort study and treated with 4 cycles of (neo)adjuvant adriamycin, cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (D). Patients collected a faecal sample and completed a questionnaire before treatment, during AC, during D, and after completing AC-D. Intestinal microbiota was analysed by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 gene-region.
In the whole group, observed species richness reduced during treatment (p=0.042). The abundance of Proteobacteria, unclassified Enterobacterales, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group, Marvinbryantia, Christensenellaceae R7 group, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-005 changed significantly over time.

Microbiome response in an urban river system is dominated by seasonality over wastewater treatment upgrades,"Microorganisms such as coliform-forming bacteria are commonly used indicators in assessing freshwater quality for drinking and recreational use. However, such organisms do not exist in isolation; rather, they exist within the context of expansive and interactive microbial communities which vary through space and time. As such, the elucidation of spatio-temporal microbial dynamics is imperative for discriminating robust community changes from ephemeral ecological trends, as well as for improving our overall understanding of the relationship between the microbial community and ecosystem health. In this study, we conducted a seven-year (2013-2019) time-series investigation of the microbial community in the Chicago Area Waterways (CAWS): an urban river system which, in 2016, experienced substantial upgrades in its wastewater disinfection processes and sewage overflow management system in an effort to improve river water quality. Using both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches, we compared the microbial ecology of the CAWS between pre-intervention and post-intervention time points. Fecal coliform assays and differential abundance analyses of the community demonstrate the impactful contribution of the intervention in removing key microbial taxa from the effluent and the downstream river community. However, examinations of whole community changes through time suggest that the upgrades did little to affect overall riverine community dynamics, which instead were overwhelmingly driven by yearly patterns consistent with seasonality. Such results emphasize the dynamic nature of microbiomes in open environmental systems such as the CAWS, but also suggest that the seasonal oscillations of such community dynamics can be consistent even when perturbed.

Integrated multi-cohort analysis of the Parkinsons disease gut metagenome - TBC,"Background: A growing body of evidence suggests alterations in the gut microbiome are associated with a Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis. 

Objective: To profile the gut metagenome in PD for alterations in microbiome composition, differentially abundant taxa, functional metabolic pathways, and microbial gene products and their relationship with disease progression.

Methods: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted on 244 unique donors from two independent cohorts in the United States, including individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD, n=48, n=47, respectively), Household Controls (HC, n=29, n=30), and Population Controls (PC, n=41, n=49). Microbial features consistently altered in PD compared to environmental and community controls were identified. Data were cross-referenced to public metagenomic datasets from two previous PD studies in Germany or China to determine globally generalizable microbiome features.

Results: The gut microbiome in PD shows modest but significant alterations in community composition. Robust taxonomic alterations include a depletion in the beneficial gut commensals Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and various Eubacterium and Roseburia species, and increased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and various Bifidobacterium species. Pathway enrichment analysis and metabolic potential, constructed from microbial gene abundance, revealed disruptions in microbial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and an increase in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. These global gene-level signatures of the PD microbiome indicate an increased response to oxidative stress, decreased cellular growth and microbial motility, and disrupted inter-community bacterial signaling. 

Conclusion: Gut profiles of PD participants show consistent alterations in taxonomic representation, functional metabolic potential, and microbial gene abundance across four independent metagenomic studies from three continents. These data suggest alterations in the PD microbiome may contribute to PD physiology, but do not exclude microbiome imprinting by disease status.

Genetically dictated change in host mucus carbohydrate landscape exerts a diet-dependent effect on the gut microbiota,"We investigate how host mucus glycan composition interacts with dietary carbohydrate content to influence the composition and expressed functions of a human gut community. The humanized gnotobiotic mice mimic humans with a nonsecretor phenotype due to knockout of their α1-2 fucosyltransferase (Fut2) gene. The fecal microbiota of Fut2(-) mice that lack fucosylated host glycans show decreased alpha diversity relative to Fut2(+) mice and exhibit significant differences in community composition. A glucose-rich plant polysaccharide-deficient (PD) diet exerted a strong effect on the microbiota membership but eliminated the effect of Fut2 genotype. Additionally fecal metabolites predicted host genotype in mice on a polysaccharide-rich standard diet but not on a PD diet. A more detailed mechanistic analysis of these interactions involved colonization of gnotobiotic Fut2(+) and Fut2(-) mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the human gut microbiota known to adaptively forage host mucosal glycans when dietary polysaccharides are absent. Within Fut2(-) mice, the B. thetaiotaomicron fucose catabolic pathway was markedly down-regulated, whereas BT4241-4247, an operon responsive to terminal β-galactose, the precursor that accumulates in the Fut2(-) mice, was significantly up-regulated. These changes in B. thetaiotaomicron gene expression were only evident in mice fed a PD diet, wherein B. thetaiotaomicron relies on host mucus consumption. Furthermore, up-regulation of the BT4241-4247 operon was also seen in humanized Fut2(-) mice. Together, these data demonstrate that differences in host genotype that affect the carbohydrate landscape of the distal gut interact with diet to alter the composition and function of resident microbes in a diet-dependent manner.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()

Persistent gut microbiota immaturity in malnourished Bangladeshi children - preliminary V4,"Therapeutic food interventions have reduced mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), but incomplete restoration of healthy growth remains a major problem. The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from monthly faecal samples obtained from birth onwards in a cohort of children living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a 'relative microbiota maturity index' and 'microbiota-for-age Z-score' that compare postnatal assembly (defined here as maturation) of a child's faecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors, including diarrhoea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Laboratory animal science', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()

The present cross-sectional study explored the associations of self-reported cognitive functioning, self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, and gut microbiome diversity and community composition in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy (BC) compared to cancer-free healthy controls (HC). The BC group displayed higher rates of cognitive dysfunction and depressive symptoms relative to HC. There was a significant difference in microbiome community composition between BC and HC, particularly characterized by a decreased relative abundance of the mucin-degrading genus Akkermansia in BC compared to HC. Association models identified significant associations between group, cognitive, depression, and microbiome variables. Overall, the study identified

The gut microbiota of wild bees and honeybees in Puerto Rico,"In the tropics, specialization of the interaction between plants and pollinators tends to decrease . In fact, wild bees can shift their floral resources, showing behavioral flexibility towards alternative floral resources. It leads to open niches, easily exploitable by other bees, such as introduced honeybees. However, on tropical islands, the floral resource diversity is much lower than ecologically similar continental regions, so the availability of resources might be lower for wild solitary bees whenever a superior pollinator enters the niche. Responses of wild bees to the introduction of honeybees on tropical islands vary. Although Puerto Rican honeybees are reported as gentle in terms of aggressiveness by showing less defensive behavior , no studies have been reporting on their direct effects on wild bees. Furthermore, because most of the honeybee’s hives in Puerto Rico are feral, it is difficult to track honeybee dispersion. Due to their highly efficient foraging behavior, they could compete with wild solitary bees for floral resources and nesting sites. From the microbiome perspective, a change in microbiome due to obligated niche shift could lead to dysbiosis, and thus a higher susceptibility to pathogen invasion, highlighting the necessity to conserve the eubiotic microbial community.

Office space bacterial abundance and diversity in three metropolitan areas,"People in developed countries spend approximately 90% of their lives indoors, yet we know little about the source and diversity of microbes in built environments. In this study, we combined culture-based cell counting and multiplexed pyrosequencing of environmental ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences to investigate office space bacterial diversity in three metropolitan areas. Five surfaces common to all offices were sampled using sterile double-tipped swabs, one tip for culturing and one for DNA extraction, in 30 different offices per city (90 offices, 450 total samples). 16S rRNA gene sequences were PCR amplified using bar-coded universal bacterial primers from 54 of the surfaces (18 per city) and pooled for pyrosequencing. A three-factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) found significant differences in viable bacterial abundance between offices inhabited by men or women, among the various surface types, and among cities. Multiplex pyrosequencing identified more than 500 bacterial genera from 20 different bacterial divisions. The most abundant of these genera tended to be common inhabitants of human skin, nasal, oral or intestinal cavities. Other commonly occurring genera appeared to have environmental origins (e.g., soils). There were no significant differences in the bacterial diversity between offices inhabited by men or women or among surfaces, but the bacterial community diversity of the Tucson samples was clearly distinguishable from that of New York and San Francisco, which were indistinguishable. Overall, our comprehensive molecular analysis of office building microbial diversity shows the potential of these methods for studying patterns and origins of indoor bacterial contamination.

The understanding of seaweed influence on plant physiology and on grapevine associated indigenous microbial communities is scarce, which is key to elucidate grapevines tolerance/susceptibility to the diseases. In addition, the impact of seaweed products on the grapes quality and fermentation process is very limited, but fundamental, in order to manipulate in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way this ecosystem in favor of viticulturists and consumers. Considering all the above, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of seaweed in viticulture using a holistic approach, integrating different scientific disciplines to acquire insights about the response of the vine holobiont to seaweed applications (comprising the grapevine as a whole together with its associated microbiota) on the whole chain: greenhouse, field and winemaking.

However, its relationship with intestinal microbiota has been scarcely studied. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the role of dietary magnesium content to modulate the intestinal microbiota of Wistar male rats. Methods: Rats were randomly assigned one of three diets: a control diet (C-Mg; 1000 mg/kg), a low magnesium content diet (L-Mg; 60 mg/kg), and a high magnesium content diet (H-Mg; 6000 mg/kg), for two weeks. After treatment, fecal samples were collected. Microbiota composition was assessed by sequencing the V3–V4 hypervariable region. Results: The C-Mg and L-Mg groups had more diversity than H-Mg group. CF231, SMB53, Dorea, Lactobacillus and Turibacter were enriched in the L-Mg group. In contrast, the phyla Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides, Butyricimonas, and Victivallis were overrepresented in the H-Mg group. PICRUSt analysis indicated that fecal microbiota of the L-Mg group were encoded with an increased abundance of metabolic pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism and butanoate metabolism.

When inulin and MgO were combined, significant changes in the microbiota composition were observed compared with inulin alone. The MgO effect on the cecal acetic acid concentration was less when administered at ZT12 than at ZT0. In conclusion, this study suggests that MgO affects cecal SCFA and microbiota during inulin feeding, and the effect on acetic acid concentration is time-dependent.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Animal study', 'Microbiology', 'Nutritional science'}",set()
The effect of dietary Magnesium on gut microbiota in mice,"The effects of dietary Mg modulation were assessed in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis by monitoring magnesemia, weight, and fecal consistency. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16S-rRNA based profiling on fecal samples. Mg supplementation improved microbiota richness in colitic mice, increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced Enterobacteriaceae. KEEG pathway analysis predicted an increase in biosynthetic metabolism, DNA repair and translation pathways during Mg supplementation and in the presence of colitis, while low Mg conditions favored catabolic processes. Thus, dietary Mg supplementation increases bacteria involved in intestinal health and metabolic homeostasis, and reduces bacteria involved in inflammation and associated with human diseases, such as IBD. These findings suggest that Mg supplementation may be a safe and cost-effective strategy to ameliorate disease symptoms and restore a beneficial intestinal flora in IBD patients.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Nutritional science'}",set()
Dynamics of intestinal and intratumoral microbiome signatures in genetically engineered mice and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Background:
Recently, emerging evidence has revealed a prominent role of the microbiome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). While to date most observations were made in PDAC patients, mouse models of PDAC still require a precise characterization of their disease-related microbiome in order to understand whether these models could be used for mechanistic and interventional preclinical studies. 
Methods:
To investigate the fecal and tumoral microbiome of LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice and control (CTRL) animals, Oxford Nanopore sequencing was applied. Feces were collected from 6-weeks-old, 12-weeks-old, and tumor-bearing KPC mice and age-matched CTRLs. After DNA extraction, metagenomic sequencing was performed. DNA from KPC tumor and healthy pancreas samples was subject to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, the 16S rRNA gene and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as bacterial marker components were detected in KPC tumor tissue over time by fluorescent-in situ-hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
Results:
Fecal samples from KPC mice have a significantly distinguishable microbiome compared to age-matched healthy CTRLs over time regarding beta diversity (p = 0.001, R2 = 0.2-0.25 for Bray-Curtis). Recently published human PDAC classifiers robustly predict disease status from feces of KPC mice achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of up to 0.822. The results remain significant even after factoring in confounding variables sex and age. Furthermore, KPC tumors harbor significantly more bacterial components than healthy pancreas quantified by FISH and IHC. Notably, also the microbial composition differs significantly between KPC tumors and healthy pancreas tissue (p = 0.042 for Bray-Curtis). Microbiota found in human PDAC samples are significantly more abundant in KPC tumors as compared to healthy pancreas (p-value < 0.001).
Conclusion:
KPC fecal samples show similarities with the microbial composition of stool samples from human PDAC patients. A comprehensive characterization of both fecal and tumoral microbiome in the KPC mouse model demonstrates its potential to serve as a predictive biomarker in the future.

"Universal microbial network decomposes mammals despite varied climate, location, and seasonal influence","Microbial breakdown of organic material is one of the most important processes on Earth, yet enormous knowledge gaps exist about its controls. We demonstrate that a universal, interkingdom microbial network assembles in response to nutrient-rich, terrestrial mammalian decomposition, despite selection effects of location, climate, and season. We created the first metagenome-assembled genome library from soils associated with mammalian decomposition and combined it with metabolomics to identify a microbial decomposer network that interacts by cross-feeding to efficiently metabolize labile decomposition products. The key fungal and bacterial decomposers appear unique to the breakdown of terrestrial cadavers, and are rare in relative abundance across non-decomposition environments. Blow flies are suggested as an important decomposer vector and the observed lockstep of microbial interactions underlies a robust microbial forensic tool for predicting the time since death.

Celiac Disease and the microbiome,"	Accumulating evidence supports the role of microbiota in autoimmune processes, but research regarding the role of the gut microbiota in celiac disease (CD) is still emerging, and a consistent CD-associated dysbiosis pattern has not yet been defined. Here, we characterized the microbiota of children newly diagnosed with CD, with their unaffected family members as a healthy control group to reduce confounding factors including genetic background, hygiene, dietary habits, and environment, and followed children with CD over 1 year of dietary intervention (exclusion of gluten) to understand if the microbiome is associated with CD and its mediation. We did not find differences in the microbiota of siblings with and without CD, despite a wealth of evidence in the literature supporting CD-specific microbiota. CD is common among first-degree relatives, so this could suggest that unaffected family members in this study may be living in a pre-CD state, currently below clinical detection. Interestingly, despite the effectiveness of diet in CD control, we did not observe diet-mediated microbiota changes, except for short-term increase in Akkermansia muciniphila. This lack of effect could suggest a very strong CD microbial signature even when controlled or could be a technical shortcoming. Expanded future studies with both related and unrelated controls and diet interventions in both the CD and control arms can provide further context to our findings.",gpt-3.5-turbo,{'Immunology'},{'Microbiology   Nutritional science'}
Autism cohort,"Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous cognitive, behavioral and communication impairments. Disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA) has been implicated in autism, with dozens of cross-sectional microbiome and other omic studies revealing autism-specific profiles along the GBA albeit with little agreement in composition or magnitude. To explore the functional architecture of autism, we developed an age and sex-matched Bayesian differential ranking algorithm that identified autism-specific profiles across 10 cross-sectional microbiome datasets and 15 other omic datasets, including dietary patterns, metabolomics, cytokine profiles, and human brain expression profiles. The analysis uncovered a highly significant, functional architecture along the GBA that encapsulated the overall heterogeneity of autism phenotypes. This architecture was determined by autism-specific amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism profiles predominantly encoded by microbial species in the genera Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides, and was mirrored in brain-associated gene expression profiles and restrictive dietary patterns in individuals with autism. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiling and virome association analysis further supported the existence of an autism-specific architecture associated with particular microbial genera. Re-analysis of a longitudinal intervention study in autism recapitulated the cross-sectional profiles, and showed a strong association between temporal changes in microbiome composition and autism symptoms. Further elucidating the dynamics of the functional architecture of autism, including of the role the microbiome plays in it, will require deep, multi-omic longitudinal intervention studies on well-defined stratified cohorts to support causal inference.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Bioinformatics', 'Microbiology', 'Omics'}",{'Autism cohort'}

Recovery of biological soil crust-like microbial communities in previously submerged soils of Glen canyon,"In 1963 the Glen Canyon Dam was completed and Lake Powell began to fill. After recent, successive years of drought in the Colorado River upper basin the water level in Lake Powell has been steadily declining, and is now approximately 100 ft below the high water line. Here we present a survey of soil microbial communities at three sites in Glen Canyon, each spanning a transect from just below the current water level to above the high water line in steps of 10 vertical feet. Approximately 100 samples were collected, and archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform to a median sampling depth of approximately 81,000 sequences per sample. We show that the phylogenetic composition of the submerged and exposed soil microbial communities are distinct, and that with time since reemergence microbial communities of exposed soils have become more similar to those of biological soil crusts, which typify undisturbed soils of the area. Our results suggest that as the water level of Lake Powell recedes, the microbial communities of Glen Canyon soils are dynamically recovering from flood disturbance.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities and metagenomes in an upland Alaskan boreal forest.,"Permafrost soils are large reservoirs of potentially labile carbon (C). Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG-CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1 m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbial community members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimately reduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Lake microbial communities are resilient after a whole-ecosystem disturbance,"Disturbances act as powerful structuring forces on ecosystems. To ask whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20C for seven weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion temperatures elevated from 6 to 20C), bacterial communities returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within 7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a major disturbance.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Freshwater biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology'}",set()
Characterization of the fecal microbiota using high-throughput sequencing reveals a stable microbial community during storage.,"The handling and treatment of biological samples is critical when characterizing the composition of the intestinal microbiota between different ecological niches or diseases. Specifically, exposure of fecal samples to room temperature or long term storage in deep freezing conditions may alter the composition of the microbiota. Thus, we stored fecal samples at room temperature and monitored the stability of the microbiota over twenty four hours. We also investigated the stability of the microbiota in fecal samples during a six month storage period at -80oC. As the stability of the fecal microbiota may be affected by intestinal disease, we analyzed two healthy controls and two patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We used high throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the microbiota in fecal samples stored at room temperature or -80oC at six and seven time points, respectively. The composition of microbial communities in IBS patients and healthy controls were determined and compared using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. The composition of the microbiota in fecal samples stored for different lengths of time at room temperature or -80oC clustered strongly based on the host each sample originated from.

Ileocecal resection dramatically affects the microbiome of the murine jejunum and colon,"Ileocecal resection (ICR) is a commonly required surgical intervention in unmanageable Crohn's disease (CD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, the impact of ICR on the intestinal commensal microbiota has not been determined. In this study, wild-type C57BL6 mice were subjected to ICR and intestinal lumen contents were collected from jejunum and colon post-operatively at 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after resection. Corresponding regions were taken from non-ICR controls. Samples were analyzed by16S rRNA bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) and quantitative PCR. Data revealed shifts in the microbiota of jejunum and colon following ICR, with dramatically decreased diversity in colon and marginally decreased diversity in jejunum 7 days after ICR. PCoA plots of microbial communities indicated that bacterial populations at 28 days post-ICR differed significantly from non-ICR controls. Moreover, the bacterial populations of jejunum and colon were remarkably similar 28 days after resection in contrast to the initial communities. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in jejunum and colon before ICR; however Firmicutes became the vastly predominant phyla in both jejunum and colon at 28 days after ICR. Although the microbiota returned to an homeostatic state, with re-establishment of Firmicutes (mainly from the class Clostridia) as the predominant phylum in both jejunum and colon at 28 days after ICR and a reduction of Proteobacteria, we did not detect Bacteroidetes in the colon 28 days after ICR, and this group was only detected at an abundance of  greater than 0.05 percent in the jejunum at the same time point. The dramatic ICR-induced changes in jejunal and colonic microbiota must therefore be considered as potential regulators of post-surgical adaptive growth, and in a setting of active IBD, potential contributors to post-surgical pathophysiology of disease recurrence.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Microbiology'}",set()
"Diversity, distribution and sources of bacteria in residential kitchens","Bacteria readily colonize kitchen surfaces, and the exchange of microbes between humans and the kitchen environment can impact human health. However, we have a limited understanding of the overall diversity of these communities, how they differ across surfaces, and sources of bacteria to kitchen surfaces. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to explore biogeographical patterns of bacteria across >80 surfaces within the kitchens of each of four households. In total, 34 bacterial and two archaeal phyla were identified, with most sequences belonging to the Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Genera known to contain common food-borne pathogens were low in abundance but broadly distributed throughout the kitchens, with different taxa exhibiting distinct distribution patterns. The most diverse communities were associated with infrequently cleaned surfaces such as fans above stoves, refrigerator/freezer door seals, and floors. In contrast, the least diverse communities were observed in and around sinks, which were dominated by biofilm-forming gram-negative lineages. Community composition was influenced by conditions on individual surfaces, usage patterns, and dispersal from source environments. Human skin was the primary source of bacteria across all kitchen surfaces, with contributions from food and faucet water dominating in a few specific locations. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed in residential kitchens and that the composition of these communities is often predictable. From a public health perspective, these results illustrate the ease with which human- and food-associated bacteria are transferred in residential settings to surfaces, which could then act as pathogen reservoirs.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Public health and epidemiology'}",set()
Changes in microbial communities along redox gradients in polygonized Arctic wet tundra soils,"Frozen soil samples were collected that represent topographically high and low areas from basins of various ages around Barrow, Alaska.

Hawaii Kohala Volcanic Soils,"We are studying a network of sites along an extreme rainfall gradient that ranges from 200 mm to 3500 mm/year over a short distance of 12 km due to orographic moisture interception by Kohala Mountain in Hawaii. This climate sequence is ideal for studying soil development because the effects of rainfall on soil properties can be isolated from other environmental factors.  Unlike most gradients that span arid to wet tropical climates, soil forming factors other than rainfall vary minimally across these sites: Parent material and topography are constant and there is minimal variation in vegetation and climate factors other than rainfall.  These unique circumstances make this gradient a powerful model field system to understand the effects of rainfall variation on soil development and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as demonstrated by the seminal work done in these areas by our collaborators Peter Vitousek (Stanford) and Oliver Chadwick (UCSB).  In spite of the wealth of ecosystem and soils research conducted at these sites, there is little known about soil microorganisms in these soils and no community characterization using DNA sequencing. We will sequence soil 16S rRNA genes from 13 different locations along the gradient.

Seasonal variation of postmortem microbial communities and Carcass mass has little influence on the structure of gravesoil microbial communities,"Body-associated microbes were recently shown to change significantly during decomposition, undergoing an ecological succession in experimental conditions using rodent and swine models. We investigated microbial succession in soils associated with swine carcasses under experimental field conditions in summer and winter. We demonstrate that these postmortem microbial communities change in a specific, reproducible fashion, and that soil microbes represent a significant component of the postmortem microbial community, contrary to widespread belief in forensic science. However, the effects of decomposition on soil microbial communities were different in summer and winter. We suggest that the microbial ecological succession will be useful in medicolegal death investigation; however, observations in winter might not be applicable to summer, which indicates a need for a greater understanding of the seasonality of decomposition.
Seasonal variation of postmortem microbial communities

Carcass mass has little influence on the structure of gravesoil microbial communities.
Little is known about how variables, such as carcass mass, affect the succession pattern of microbes in soils during decomposition. To investigate the effects of carcass mass on the soil microbial community, soils associated with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) carcasses of four different masses were sampled until the 15th day of decomposition during the month of June in a pasture near Lincoln, Nebraska. Soils underneath swine of 1, 20, 40, and 50 kg masses were investigated in triplicate, as well as control sites not associated with a carcass. Soil microbial communities were characterized by sequencing the archaeal, bacterial (16S), and eukaryotic (18S) rRNA genes in soil samples. We conclude that time of decomposition was a significant influence on the microbial community, but carcass mass was not. The gravesoil associated with 1 kg mass carcasses differs most compared to the gravesoil associated with other carcass masses. We also identify the 15 most abundant bacterial and eukaryotic taxa, and discuss changes in their abundance as carcass decomposition progressed. Finally, we show significant decreases in alpha diversity for carcasses of differing mass in pre-carcass rupture (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 postmortem) versus post-carcass rupture (days 9 and 15 postmortem) microbial communities.

Microbial community dynamics and effect of environmental microbial reservoirs on red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus),"Beneficial cutaneous bacteria on amphibians can protect against the lethal disease chytridiomycosis, which has devastated many amphibian species and is caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We describe the diversity of bacteria on red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) in the wild and the stability of these communities through time in captivity using culture-independent Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing. After field sampling, salamanders were housed with soil from the field or sterile media. The captive conditions led to different trajectories of bacterial communities. Eight OTUs present on >90% of salamanders in the field, through time, and in both treatments were defined as the core community, suggesting that some bacteria are closely associated with the host and are independent of an environmental reservoir. One of these taxa, a Pseudomonas sp., was previously cultured from amphibians and found to be antifungal. As all host-associated bacteria were found in the soil reservoir, environmental microbes strongly influence host-microbial diversity and likely regulate the core community. Using PICRUSt, an exploratory bioinformatics tool to predict gene functions, we found that core skin bacteria provided similar gene functions to the entire community. We suggest that future experiments focus on testing whether core bacteria on salamander skin contribute to the observed resistance to chytridiomycosis in this species even under hygenic captive conditions. For disease-susceptible hosts, providing an environmental reservoir with defensive bacteria in captive-rearing programs may improve outcomes by increasing bacterial diversity on threatened amphibians or increasing the likelihood that defensive bacteria are available for colonization.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
TIme series to determine the effect of Monensin on microbial hindgut bacterial composition,"This study aims to investigate the effect of monensin (Rumensin, Elanco-Eli Lilly Co.) on the microbial community structure of the cow hindgut. Monensin is an ionophore antibiotic administered to cattle and dairy cows to increase their feed efficiency by altering rumen fermentation. Monensin acts by changing the activity of specific metabolic pathways, leading to an increase in propionate concentrations and a decrease in acetate and butyrate concentrations in the cow rumen. Previous studies conducted on the effect of monensin on rumen microbial community structure have led to differing conclusions. In addition, few studies have been conducted to assess the effect of monensin on the microbial community structure elsewhere in the cow digestive tract, such as in the cow hindgut. For the current study, manure was collected, over a period of three months, from eight dairy cows housed at the Teaching and Research Center at Cornell University. Four of the cows were fed a control diet containing no monensin. The other four cows were fed a diet with measured incrementally increasing amounts of monensin. To investigate the effect of monensin on the microbial community composition of the cow hindgut, a total of 184 rectal grab samples were collected from the eight cows over the three month period. Once collected, the samples were processed and stored in a -80degreeC freezer for later microbial community composition analysis.

Geographic distance and pH drive bacterial distribution in alkaline lake sediments across Tibetan Plateau,"Continent-scale biogeography has been extensively studied in soils and marine systems, but little is known about biogeographical patterns in non-marine sediments. We used barcode pyrosequencing to quantify the effects of local geochemical properties and geographic distance for bacterial community structure and membership, using sediment samples from 15 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (4–1670 km apart). Bacterial communities were surprisingly diverse, and distinct from soil communities. Four of 26 phyla detected were dominant: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, albeit 20.2% of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. As previously observed in acidic soil, pH was the dominant factor influencing alkaline sediment community structure, phylotype richness and phylogenetic diversity. In contrast, archaeal communities were less affected by pH. More geographically distant sites had more dissimilar communities (r = 0.443, P = 0.030). Variance partitioning analysis showed that geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (12.2%) than any other factor, although the environmental factors explained more variance when combined (28.9%). Together, our results show that pH is the best predictor of bacterial community structure in alkaline sediments, and confirm that both geographic distance and chemical factors govern bacterial biogeography in lake sediments.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",{'Biogeography'}

Bacterial density rather than diversity correlates with hatching success across different avian species,"Bacterial communities within avian nests are considered an important determinant of egg viability, potentially selecting for traits that confer embryos with protection against trans-shell infection. A high bacterial density on the eggshell increases hatching failure, whether this effect could be due to changes in bacterial community or just a general increase in bacterial density. We explored this idea using intra- and interspecific comparisons of the relationship between hatching success and eggshell bacteria characterized by culture and molecular techniques (fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing). We collected information for 152 nests belonging to 17 bird species. Hatching failures occurred more frequently in nests with higher density of aerobic mesophilic bacteria on their eggshells. Bacterial community was also related to hatching success, but only when minority bacterial operational taxonomic units were considered. These findings support the hypothesis that bacterial density is a selective agent of embryo viability, and hence a proxy of hatching failure only within species. Although different avian species hold different bacterial densities or assemblages on their eggs, the association between bacteria and hatching success was similar for different species. This result suggests that interspecific differences in antibacterial defenses are responsible for keeping the hatching success at similar levels in different species.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Animal study', 'Ecology'}",set()
Immunization with a heat-killed preparation of the environmental bacterium Mycobacterium vaccae promotes stress resilience in mice,"The prevalence of inflammatory diseases is increasing in modern urban societies. Inflammation increases risk of stress-related pathology; consequently, immunoregulatory or antiinflammatory approaches may protect against negative stress-related outcomes. We show that stress disrupts the homeostatic relationship between the microbiota and the host, resulting in exaggerated inflammation. Repeated immunization with a heat-killed preparation of Mycobacterium vaccae, an immu- noregulatory environmental microorganism, reduced subordinate, flight, and avoiding behavioral responses to a dominant aggressor in a murine model of chronic psychosocial stress when tested 1–2 wk following the final immunization. Furthermore, immunization with M. vaccae prevented stress-induced spontaneous colitis and, in stressed mice, induced anxiolytic or fear-reducing effects as mea- sured on the elevated plus-maze, despite stress-induced gut micro- biota changes characteristic of gut infection and colitis. Immunization with M. vaccae also prevented stress-induced aggravation of colitis in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Depletion of regulatory T cells negated protective effects of immunization with M. vaccae on stress-induced colitis and anxiety-like or fear behaviors.

Bacterial communities associated with the surfaces of fresh fruits and vegetables.,"Fresh fruits and vegetables can harbor large and diverse populations of bacteria.

"Urban stress is associated with variation in microbial species composition, but not richness, in Manhattan","Green roof and city park samples. In urban environments, green roofs provide a number of potential benefits, including decreases in urban heat island effects and reduced energy costs for buildings.  However, they may also serve as habitat islands for maintaining biodiversity across the landscape, similarly to city parks.  In this project, eleven experimental green roofs were sampled in addition to five city parks. The green roofs were spread across all five boroughs of New York City and were established in 2010 on top of select recreation centers run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. All experimental green roofs were planted with the same density of native plant communities from the greater New York area and had identical soil substrate and planting box dimensions. The five city parks chosen for sampling included Central Park, the largest park in New York City, and the High Line, which is the newest large park established in the city. From each green roof, six composite soil cores (0-10 cm) were taken from six planting boxes (each box 4 m X 2 m) for a total of six representative samples per green roof. On three of the green roofs, we sampled in a spatially-explicit manner to capture fine-scale heterogeneity in microbial composition. For these samples, 10 individual soil cores were collected from three planting boxes for a total of 30 soil cores per roof. From each city park, three plots (20 m X 20 m) were sampled and five soil cores (0 to 10 cm) were composited as a representative sample for each plot. In Central Park, five plots were sampled rather than three plots due to the larger size of the park. Research questions: Do green roofs planted with native plants in New York City function as biodiversity reservoirs for bacteria, is there significant heterogeneity in microbial community composition at fine spatial scales within individual green roofs, based on the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of green roof soil bacteria, how many samples are necessary to collect as a representative sample for each green roof, how much overlap is there in microbial community composition of the green roof substrates and city park soils and is there evidence for biogeographical structuring of green roof microbial communities across New York City.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biodiversity'}",set()

"A combination of biochar-mineral complexes and compost improves soil bacterial processes, soil quality, and plant properties","Biochar is derived from the oxygen-limited pyrolysis of organic matter (e.g. agricultural or municipal waste) and constitutes for complex structure of recalcitrant, porous carbon and well as mobile minerals and nutrients. Several studies have shown that the addition of biochar improves agricultural yields and performance in a way comparable to classical NPK or urea-based fertilisers. Biochar is therefore an emerging and attractive replacement for classical farming practices with the additional benefit of sequestering carbon that would otherwise be burnt or composted. The mechanisms behind the beneficial properties of biochar are not well understood, but initial work has shown that its amendment to soil impacts on microbial community composition. To better understand these processes, this project will obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community in bulk soil, roots and biochar particles in agricultural soils that were supplemented with various amounts of biochar as part of a field trial executed by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI). A total of 253 samples will be analysed, that constitute a design that will allow us to understand where the most pronounced microbial changes occur (e.g. biochar particle versus soil) and what changes in the microbial communities occur over time.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Agricultural science'}",set()

Gut microbiota of phyllostomid bats that span a breadth of diets,"The microbial communities that inhabit the gut of animals play essential roles in host biology including nutrient provisioning, regulation of tissue development, and immune system development.  Both ecological and evolutionary forces are thought to have shaped these communities. However, previous efforts to quantify the extent to which different factors contribute to the structure of gut bacterial communities have targeted either a range of host diversity too narrow to analyze ecological drivers of community structure, or so wide that diet and phylogeny are tightly correlated, and thus difficult to disentangle.  In order to assess the relative contribution of host ecology (including dietary specializations) and evolution (phylogenetic relationships) in shaping gut microbiome diversity we have chosen to study the phyllostomid bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae).  Phyllostomid bats span almost the entire dietary diversity known for terrestrial mammals, with omnivorous, insectivorous, carnivorous, hematophagous, nectarivorous, and frugivorous species. Crucially, there is a robust phylogenetic framework for this group that indicates dietary specialization has evolved multiple times from insect-feeding ancestors.  Nectar feeding and carnivory have each evolved twice, the inclusion of some fruit in the diet has evolved 5 times, and blood-feeding and extreme frugivory have evolved one time each.  Repeated instances of the evolution of dietary specializations enable analyses that separate host diet and environment from phylogeny as drivers of bacterial community structure. To date, we have collected 96 fecal samples for 38 species that span the dietary diversity of the clade. All of these samples were collected in the field in Belize and Ecuador, and thus represent the microbiome of these bats in their natural habitat.  We would like to generate 16S and shotgun metagenomic sequences for these samples to assess community membership and function.  This project represents a significant step forward in the characterization of vertebrate microbiome because it enables hypotheses on the relative importance of different factors in structuring bacterial communities to be explicitly tested.  These data will also provide insight into the role the gut microbial community plays in adaptation to novel diets.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",set()
Coinfection and infection duration shape how pathogens affect the African buffalo gut microbiota,"Changes in the gut microbiota during pathogen infection are often predicted to influence disease outcomes. However, studies exploring whether pathogens induce microbiota shifts have yielded inconsistent results. This suggests that variation in infection, rather than the presence of infection alone, might shape pathogen–microbiota relationships. For example, most hosts are coinfected with multiple pathogens simultaneously, and hosts vary in how long they are infected, which may amplify or diminish microbial shifts expected in response to a focal pathogen. We used a longitudinal anthelmintic treatment study of free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to examine whether (i) coinfection with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis, TB) and gastrointestinal nematodes, and (ii) the duration of TB infection, modified effects of single pathogens on the gut microbiota. By accounting for the interaction between TB and nematodes, we found that coinfection affected changes in microbial abundance associated with single infections. Furthermore, the duration of TB infection predicted more microbiota variation than the presence of TB. Importantly, coinfection and infection duration had nearly as much influence on microbial patterns as demographic and environmental factors commonly examined in microbiota research. These findings demonstrate that acknowledging infection heterogeneities may be crucial to understanding relationships between pathogens and the gut microbiota.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
A cross-taxon analysis of insect-associated bacterial diversity,"Although it is well known that plants and animals harbor microbial symbionts that can influence host traits, the factors regulating the structure of these microbial communities often remain largely undetermined. This is particularly true for insect-associated microbial communities, as few cross-taxon comparisons have been conducted to date. To address this knowledge gap and determine how host phylogeny and ecology affect insect-associated microbial communities, we collected 137 insect specimens representing 39 species, 28 families, and 8 orders, and characterized the bacterial communities associated with each specimen via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial taxa within the phylum Proteobacteria were dominant in nearly all insects sampled. On average, the insect-associated bacterial communities were not very diverse, with individuals typically harboring fewer than 8 bacterial phylotypes. Bacterial communities also tended to be dominated by a single phylotype; on average, the most abundant phylotype represented 54.7% of community membership. Bacterial communities were significantly more similar among closely related insects than among less-related insects, a pattern driven by within-species community similarity but detected at every level of insect taxonomy tested. Diet was a poor predictor of bacterial community composition. Individual insect species harbored remarkably unique communities: the distribution of 69.0% of bacterial phylotypes was limited to unique insect species, whereas only 5.7% of phylotypes were detected in more than five insect species. Together these results suggest that host characteristics strongly regulate the colonization and assembly of bacterial communities across insect lineages, patterns that are driven either by co-evolution between insects and their symbionts or by closely related insects sharing conserved traits that directly select for similar bacterial communities.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",set()

Despite their ubiquity and abundance, we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity found within homes and how the composition and diversity of microbial communities change across different locations within the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes.

Here, we characterized the rhizosphere bacterial diversity of 27 modern maize inbreds possessing exceptional genetic diversity grown under field conditions. Randomized and replicated plots of the inbreds were planted in five field environments in three states, each with unique soils and management conditions. Using pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we observed substantial variation in bacterial richness, diversity and relative abundances of taxa between bulk soil and the maize rhizosphere, as well as between fields. The rhizospheres from maize inbreds exhibited both a small but significant proportion of heritable variation in total bacterial diversity across fields, and substantially more heritable variation between replicates of the inbreds within each field.

Reconstructing the microbial diversity and function of pre-agricultural tallgrass prairie soils in the United States,"Although soil microbes play critical roles in terrestrial ecosystems, factors controlling spatial variability in the diversity and functional capabilities of these communities remain poorly understood. Particular knowledge gaps exist for biomes severely impacted by human activities, including the native tallgrass prairie that once covered >65 million ha of the midwestern United States, but has been nearly eradicated by decades of agricultural practices. Here we have reconstructed the microbial biodiversity that once sustained this highly productive ecosystem by analyzing soils from prairie relicts via shotgun metagenomics and targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbial communities were well-correlated, demonstrating that these communities are not functionally equivalent as has often been assumed - even small changes in belowground diversity can have important impacts on soil processes. As for many plant and animal communities, we could predict the structure and functional traits of the microbial communities from climatic conditions, allowing us to build predictive maps of soil biodiversity across the historical range of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The biogeographical patterns were largely driven by changes in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia, a poorly-studied bacterial phylum that dominated the prairie soils. The shotgun metagenomic data suggest that these spatial patterns were associated with shifts in soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. We show that we can use metagenomic data to reconstruct the belowground biogeochemical and diversity gradients that once existed, information that could be essential to guiding ongoing efforts to restore the threatened tallgrass prairie ecosystem.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Biodiversity'}",set()

Microbial diversity in arctic freshwaters is structured by inoculation of microbes from soils,"A 12-year sample archive of DNA from Alaskan arctic tundra ecosystems are available to the Earth Microbiome Project for comparison of microbial diversity across a range of arctic environments from soils to water to sediments. These samples were preserved and extracted using a method that differs from that of the EMP. Therefore, we must test how the extraction method used to extract our archived samples compares with those methods used by the EMP. The samples for this test were collected during the summer of 2011 at the Toolik Field Station. Each site was sampled in triplicate and samples were divided and preserved for extraction using our standard protocol (three replicates), and for extraction using the EMP protocol (three replicates). Half of the samples are from the epilimnion and hypolimnion of ultra-oligotrophic Toolik Lake collected over the course of the summer, and the rest are from different environments associated with a headwater stream that lies upslope of Toolik Lake. The data from these samples will allow us to test whether our extraction protocol yields results that are similar to the EMP extraction protocol, to investigate how replicates compare, and to determine how the microbial community and its metagenome changes over the course of the summer in Arctic tundra waters.

A microbial clock provides an accurate estimate of the postmortem interval in a mouse model system - 18S,"Establishing the time since death or postmortem interval (PMI) is critical in the initial stages of death investigations, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of errors and biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess PMI, but errors can range on the scale of days, weeks or season depending on the scenario1. Limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and initial egg deposition2, lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons3, and regionally specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities4. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that might avoid many of these limitations, because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. However, the feasibility of using microbes forensically has yet to be rigorously tested, and we must determine whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate predictions.  Here, we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing estimates of PMI to within ~3 days over 48 days, and provide insight into the ecological factors underlying succession of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes within the decomposing corpse system.

Dynamic changes in short- and long-term bacterial composition following fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"Background:
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that often fails standard antibiotic therapy. Despite its widespread recent use, however, little is known about the stability of the fecal microbiota following FMT.

Results:
Here we report on short- and long-term changes and provide kinetic visualization of fecal microbiota composition in patients with multiply recurrent CDI that were refractory to antibiotic therapy and treated using FMT. Fecal samples were collected from four patients before and up to 151 days after FMT, with daily collections until 28 days and weekly collections until 84 days post-FMT. The composition of fecal bacteria was characterized using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, compared to microbiota across body sites in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) database, and visualized in a movie-like, kinetic format. FMT resulted in rapid normalization of bacterial fecal sample composition from a markedly dysbiotic state to one representative of normal fecal microbiota. While the microbiome appeared most similar to the donor implant material 1 day post-FMT, the composition diverged variably at later time points. The donor microbiota composition also varied over time. However, both post-FMT and donor samples remained within the larger cloud of fecal microbiota characterized as healthy by the HMP.

Conclusions:
Dynamic behavior is an intrinsic property of normal fecal microbiota and should be accounted for in comparing microbial communities among normal individuals and those with disease states. This also suggests that more frequent sample analyses are needed in order to properly assess success of FMT procedures.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()

"Changes in bacterial and fungal communities across compost recipes, preparation methods, and composting times - 16S","Compost production is a critical component of organic waste handling, and compost applications to soil are increasingly important to crop production. However, we know surprisingly little about the microbial communities involved in the composting process and the factors shaping compost microbial dynamics. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing approaches to assess the diversity and composition of both bacterial and fungal communities in compost produced at a commercial-scale. Bacterial and fungal communities responded to both compost recipe and composting method. Specifically, bacterial communities in manure and hay recipes contained greater relative abundances of Firmicutes than hardwood recipes with hay recipes containing relatively more Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes. In contrast, hardwood recipes contained a large relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi. Fungal communities of manure-silage samples were distinguished by a greater relative abundance of Pezizomycetes and Microascales. Hay recipes uniquely contained abundant Epicoccum, Thermomyces, Eurotium, Arthrobotrys, and Myriococcum. Hardwood recipes contained relatively abundant Sordariomycetes. Holding recipe constant, there were significantly different bacterial and fungal communities when the composting process was managed by windrow, aerated static pile, or vermicompost. Temporal dynamics of the composting process followed known patterns of degradative succession in herbivore manure.  The initial community was dominated by Phycomycetes, followed by ascomycetes and finally basidiomycetes. Zygomycota were associated more with manure-silage and hay than hardwood composts.  Most commercial composters focus on the thermophilic phase as an economic means to insure sanitation of compost from pathogens. However, the community succeeding the thermophilic phase begs further investigation to determine how the microbial dynamics observed here can be best managed to generate compost with the desired properties.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
The Treatment-Naive Microbiome in New-Onset Crohn s Disease ,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However, patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD.

Addition of Christensenella minuta to an obese donor fecal microbiome resulted in reduced weight gain and an altered fecal microbiota in recipient germfree mice.

The microbiota at multiple body sites during pregnancy in a rural Tanzanian population and the effects of Moringa supplemented probiotic yogurt. ,"The nutritional status of pregnant women is vital for healthy outcomes and is a concern for a large proportion of the world's population. The role of the microbiota in pregnancy and nutrition is a promising new area of study with potential health ramifications. In many African countries, maternal and infant death and morbidity are associated with malnutrition. Here, we assess the influence of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, supplemented with Moringa plant as a source of micronutrients, on the health and oral, gut, vaginal, and milk microbiotas of 56 pregnant women in Tanzania. In an open-label study design, 26 subjects received yogurt daily, and 30 were untreated during the last two trimesters and for 1 month after birth. Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and dietary recalls were recorded. Women initially categorized as nourished or undernourished consumed similar calories and macronutrients, which may explain why there was no difference in the microbiota at any body site. Consumption of yogurt increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and decreased Enterobacteriaceae in the newborn feces but had no effect on the mother's microbiota at any body site. The microbiota of the oral cavity and GI tract remained stable over pregnancy, but the vaginal microbiota showed a significant increase in diversity leading up to and after birth. In summary, daily micronutrient-supplemented probiotic yogurt provides a safe, affordable food for pregnant women in rural Tanzania, and the resultant improvement in the gut microbial profile of infants is worthy of further study.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology', 'Public health and epidemiology'}",set()

Shifts in bacterial community structure associated with inputs of low molecular weight carbon compounds to soil,"Low molecular weight carbon (C) substrates are major drivers of bacterial activity and diversity in the soil environment. However, it is not well understood how specific low molecular weight C compounds, which are frequently found in root exudates and litter leachates, influence bacterial community structure or if there are specific groups of soil bacteria that preferentially respond to these C inputs. To address these knowledge gaps, we added three simple C substrates representative of common root exudate compounds (glucose, glycine, and citric acid) to microcosms containing three distinct soils from a grassland, hardwood forest, and coniferous forest. CO2 production was assessed over a 24h incubation period and, at the end of the incubation, DNA was extracted from the samples for assessment of bacterial community structure via bar-coded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All three C substrates significantly increased CO2 production in all soils; however, there was no relationship between the magnitude of the increase in CO2 production and the shift in bacterial community composition. All three substrates had significant effects on overall community structure with the changes primarily driven by relative increases in Proteobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citric acid additions had a particularly strong influence on bacterial communities, producing a 25-fold increase in the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria subphylum. These results suggest that although community-level responses to substrate additions vary depending on the substrate and soil in question, there are specific bacterial taxa that preferentially respond to the substrate additions across soil.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'DNA', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Microbial consumption and production of volatile organic compounds at the soil-litter interface,"Substantial amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be released during decomposition and these compounds can affect atmospheric chemistry, belowground processes, and the structure of microbial communities in litter and soil. However, we have a limited understanding of the types, quantities and ecological impacts of VOCs emitted from litter. Here we used a closed flow-through system and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to characterize VOC emissions from soil and two litter types (Pinus taeda and Acer rubrum) over a 72-day incubation period. Microbial respiration rates were measured throughout the incubation, and the soils were harvested at the end of the incubation to determine how litter VOCs influenced soil C dynamics, N mineralization rates, and bacterial communities. Using the PTR-MS we identified over 100 VOCs, with 10 VOCs making up the majority of emissions. VOCs accounted for up to 2.5% of the C flux from litter. Soil was a net sink of litter VOCs, absorbing up to 80% of VOCs released by litter, and exposure of soil to litter VOCs increased microbial respiration rates in soil by up to 15%. However, we observed negligible impacts of litter VOCs on soil nutrient levels and bacterial community structure, suggesting that soils must be exposed to higher concentrations of VOCs than observed in our study, to cause effects on these soil characteristics. Overall, VOCs appear to have an important influence on C dynamics at the soil-litter interface and VOC emissions from decomposing litter may represent an understudied component of biosphere atmosphere interactions.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Carbon cycle', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Temporal variability is a personalized feature of the human microbiome - palm samples,"BACKGROUND:
It is now apparent that the complex microbial communities found on and in the human body vary across individuals. What has largely been missing from previous studies is an understanding of how these communities vary over time within individuals. To the extent to which it has been considered, it is often assumed that temporal variability is negligible for healthy adults. Here we address this gap in understanding by profiling the forehead, gut (fecal), palm, and tongue microbial communities in 85 adults, weekly over 3 months.

RESULTS:
We found that skin (forehead and palm) varied most in the number of taxa present, whereas gut and tongue communities varied more in the relative abundances of taxa. Within each body habitat, there was a wide range of temporal variability across the study population, with some individuals harboring more variable communities than others. The best predictor of these differences in variability across individuals was microbial diversity; individuals with more diverse gut or tongue communities were more stable in composition than individuals with less diverse communities.

CONCLUSIONS:
Longitudinal sampling of a relatively large number of individuals allowed us to observe high levels of temporal variability in both diversity and community structure in all body habitats studied. These findings suggest that temporal dynamics may need to be considered when attempting to link changes in microbiome structure to changes in health status. Furthermore, our findings show that, not only is the composition of an individual's microbiome highly personalized, but their degree of temporal variability is also a personalized feature.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Microbiology', 'Human genetics'}",set()

It is now apparent that the complex microbial communities found on and in the human body vary across individuals.

Network analysis identified humans as the primary bacterial vector, and a Bayesian method significantly matched individuals to their dwellings. Draft genomes of potential human pathogens observed on a kitchen counter could be matched to the hands of occupants.

Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales - fwd,"Background,disturbance to human microbiota has been associated with numerous pathologies. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding for how human health and lifestyle affect the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities. Results, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of host wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time-series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each of the subjects life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically-similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, we could associate the dynamics of select microbial taxa to specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15 percent of gut microbiota members.Conclusions,our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Changes in assembly processes in soil bacterial communities following a wildfire disturbance,"Although recent work has shown that both deterministic and stochastic processes are important in structuring microbial communities, the factors that affect the relative contributions of niche and neutral processes are poorly understood. The macrobiological literature indicates that ecological disturbances can influence assembly processes. Thus, we sampled bacterial communities at 4 and 16 weeks following a wildfire and used null deviation analysis to examine the role that time since disturbance has in community assembly. Fire dramatically altered bacterial community structure and diversity as well as soil chemistry for both time-points. Community structure shifted between 4 and 16 weeks for both burned and unburned communities. Community assembly in burned sites 4 weeks after fire was significantly more stochastic than in unburned sites. After 16 weeks, however, burned communities were significantly less stochastic than unburned communities. Thus, we propose a three-phase model featuring shifts in the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as a function of time since disturbance. Because neutral processes are characterized by a decoupling between environmental parameters and community structure, we hypothesize that a better understanding of community assembly may be important in determining where and when detailed studies of community composition are valuable for predicting ecosystem function.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",{'Environmental Sciences'}
"Continental-scale variation in seaweed host-associated bacterial communities is a function of host condition, not geography","Interactions between hosts and associated microbial communities can fundamentally shape the development and ecology of 'holobionts', from humans to marine habitat-forming organisms such as seaweeds. In marine systems, planktonic microbial community structure is mainly driven by geography and related environmental factors, but the large-scale drivers of host-associated microbial communities are largely unknown. Using 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized 260 seaweed-associated bacterial and archaeal communities on the kelp Ecklonia radiata from three biogeographical provinces spanning 10° of latitude and 35° of longitude across the Australian continent. These phylogenetically and taxonomically diverse communities were more strongly and consistently associated with host condition than geographical location or environmental variables, and a 'core' microbial community characteristic of healthy kelps appears to be lost when hosts become stressed. Microbial communities on stressed individuals were more similar to each other among locations than those on healthy hosts. In contrast to biogeographical patterns of planktonic marine microbial communities, host traits emerge as critical determinants of associated microbial community structure of these holobionts, even at a continental scale.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Biodiversity', 'Marine biology'}",set()

Individuals diet diversity influences gut microbial diversity in two freshwater fish (threespine stickleback and Eurasian perch) - 1/4,"Vertebrates' diets profoundly influence the composition of symbiotic gut microbial communities. Studies documenting diet-microbiota associations typically focus on univariate or categorical diet variables. However, in nature individuals often consume diverse combinations of foods. If diet components act independently, each providing distinct microbial colonists or nutrients, we expect a positive relationship between diet diversity and microbial diversity. We tested this prediction within each of two fish species (stickleback and perch), in which individuals vary in their propensity to eat littoral or pelagic invertebrates or mixtures of both prey. Unexpectedly, in most cases individuals with more generalised diets had less diverse microbiota than dietary specialists, in both natural and laboratory populations. This negative association between diet diversity and microbial diversity was small but significant, and most apparent after accounting for complex interactions between sex, size and diet.

18s rRNA gene data - Seasonal variation of postmortem microbial communities and Carcass mass has little influence on the structure of gravesoil microbial communities,"Seasonal variation of postmortem microbial communities
Body-associated microbes were recently shown to change significantly during decomposition, undergoing an ecological succession in experimental conditions using rodent and swine models. We investigated microbial succession in soils associated with swine carcasses under experimental field conditions in summer and winter. We demonstrate that these postmortem microbial communities change in a specific, reproducible fashion, and that soil microbes represent a significant component of the postmortem microbial community, contrary to widespread belief in forensic science. However, the effects of decomposition on soil microbial communities were different in summer and winter. We suggest that the microbial ecological succession will be useful in medicolegal death investigation; however, observations in winter might not be applicable to summer, which indicates a need for a greater understanding of the seasonality of decomposition.

Carcass mass has little influence on the structure of gravesoil microbial communities
Little is known about how variables, such as carcass mass, affect the succession pattern of microbes in soils during decomposition. To investigate the effects of carcass mass on the soil microbial community, soils associated with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) carcasses of four different masses were sampled until the 15th day of decomposition during the month of June in a pasture near Lincoln, Nebraska. Soils underneath swine of 1, 20, 40, and 50 kg masses were investigated in triplicate, as well as control sites not associated with a carcass. Soil microbial communities were characterized by sequencing the archaeal, bacterial (16S), and eukaryotic (18S) rRNA genes in soil samples. We conclude that time of decomposition was a significant influence on the microbial community, but carcass mass was not. The gravesoil associated with 1 kg mass carcasses differs most compared to the gravesoil associated with other carcass masses. We also identify the 15 most abundant bacterial and eukaryotic taxa, and discuss changes in their abundance as carcass decomposition progressed. Finally, we show significant decreases in alpha diversity for carcasses of differing mass in pre-carcass rupture (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 postmortem) versus post-carcass rupture (days 9 and 15 postmortem) microbial communities.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()

Furthermore, Christensenellaceae and its partners were enriched in individuals with low body mass index (BMI). An obese-associated microbiome was amended with Christensenella minuta, a cultured member of the Christensenellaceae, and transplanted to germfree mice.

Characterization of Airborne Microbial Communities at a High-Elevation Site and Their Potential To Act as Atmospheric Ice Nuclei,"Bacteria and fungi are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. The diversity and abundance of airborne microbes may be strongly influenced by atmospheric conditions or even influence atmospheric conditions themselves by acting as ice nucleators. However, few comprehensive studies have described the diversity and dynamics of airborne bacteria and fungi based on culture independent techniques. We document atmospheric microbial abundance, community composition, and ice nucleation at a high-elevation site in northwestern Colorado. We used a standard small-subunit rRNA gene Sanger sequencing approach for total microbial community analysis and a bacteria-specific 16S rRNA bar-coded pyrosequencing approach (4,864 sequences total). During the 2-week collection period, total microbial abundances were relatively constant, ranging from 9.6 x 105 to 6.6 x 106 cells m3 of air, and the diversity and composition of the airborne microbial communities were also relatively static. Bacteria and fungi were nearly equivalent, and members of the proteobacterial groups Burkholderiales and Moraxellaceae (particularly the genus Psychrobacter) were dominant. These taxa were not always the most abundant in freshly fallen snow samples collected at this site. Although there was minimal variability in microbial abundances and composition within the atmosphere, the number of biological ice nuclei increased significantly during periods of high relative humidity. However, these changes in ice nuclei numbers were not associated with changes in the relative abundances of the most commonly studied ice-nucleating bacteria.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Zoology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
"Population genetic structure of the prairie dog flea and plague vector, Oropsylla hirsuta","A common strategy of pathogenic bacteria is to form close associations with parasitic insects that feed on animals and to use these insects as vectors for their own transmission. Pathogens interact closely with other coexisting bacteria within the insect, and interactions between co-occurring bacteria may influence the vector competency of the parasite. Interactions between particular lineages can be explored through measures of alpha-diversity. Furthermore, general patterns of bacterial community assembly can be explored through measures of beta-diversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing (n=115_924 16S rRNA gene sequences) to describe the bacterial communities of 230 prairie dog fleas sampled across space and time. We use these communinty characterizations to assess interactions between dominant community members and to explore general patterns of bacterial community assembly in fleas. An analysis of co-occurrence patterns suggests non-neutral negative interactions between dominant community members (P<0.001). Furthermore, bacterial communities of fleas shift dramatically across years (phylotype-based: R=0.829, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.6120.753, P<0.001), but they also significantly differ across space (phylotype-based: R=0.418, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.2900.328, P<0.001) and between flea species (phylotype based: R=0.160, P=0.011; phylogenetic-based: not significant).

We used a novel pyrosequencing-based method that allowed us to survey hand surface bacterial communities at an unprecedented level of detail. The diversity of skin-associated bacterial communities was surprisingly high; a typical hand surface harbored >150 unique species-level bacterial phylotypes, and we identified a total of 4,742 unique phylotypes across all of the hands examined. Although there was a core set of bacterial taxa commonly found on the palm surface, we observed pronounced intra- and interpersonal variation in bacterial community composition: hands from the same individual shared only 17 percent of their phylotypes, with different individuals sharing only 13 percent. Women had significantly higher diversity than men, and community composition was significantly affected by handedness, time since last hand washing, and an individuals sex.

"Human oral, gut, and plaque microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis","Periodontal disease has been associated with atherosclerosis, suggesting that bacteria from the oral cavity may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the gut microbiota may affect obesity, which is associated with atherosclerosis. Using qPCR we demonstrated that bacterial DNA was present in the atherosclerotic plaque and that the amount of DNA correlated with the amount of leukocytes in the atherosclerotic plaque. To investigate the microbial composition of atherosclerotic plaques and test the hypothesis that the oral or gut microbiota may contribute to atherosclerosis in humans, we used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to survey the bacterial diversity of atherosclerotic plaque, oral, and gut samples of 15 patients with atherosclerosis, and oral and gut samples of healthy controls. We identified Chryseomonas in all atherosclerotic plaque samples, and Veillonella and Streptococcus in the majority. Interestingly, the combined abundances of Veillonella and Streptococcus in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with their abundance in the oral cavity. Moreover, several additional bacterial phylotypes were common to the atherosclerotic plaque and oral or gut samples within the same individual. Interestingly, several bacterial taxa in the oral cavity and the gut correlated with plasma cholesterol levels. Taken together our findings suggest that bacteria from the oral cavity, and perhaps even the gut, may correlate with disease markers of atherosclerosis.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Medical biotechnology', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()
Effect of storage conditions on the assessment of bacterial community structure in soil and human-associated samples,"Abstract Storage conditions are considered to be a critical component of DNA-based microbial community analysis methods. However, whether differences in short-term sample storage conditions impact the assessment of bacterial community composition and diversity requires systematic and quantitative assessment. Therefore, we used barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to survey communities, harvested from a variety of habitats [soil, human gut (feces) and human skin] and subsequently stored at 20, 4, -20 and -80 degrees C for 3 and 14 days. Our results indicate that the phylogenetic structure and diversity of communities in individual samples were not significantly influenced by the storage temperature or the duration of storage. Likewise, the relative abundances of most taxa were largely unaffected by temperature even after 14 days of storage. Our results indicate that environmental factors and biases in molecular techniques likely confer greater amounts of variation to microbial communities than do differences in short-term storage conditions, including storage for up to 2 weeks at room temperature.

Postprandial remodeling of the gut microbiota in Burmese pythons,"The vertebrate gut microbiota evolved in an environment typified by periodic fluctuations in nutrient availability, yet little is known about its responses to host feeding and fasting. As many model species (for example, mice) are adapted to lifestyles of frequent small meals, we turned to the Burmese python, a sit-and-wait foraging snake that consumes large prey at long intervals, greater than 1 month, to examine the effects of a dynamic nutrient milieu on the gut microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities harvested from the intestines of fasted and digesting snakes, and from their rodent meal. In this unprecedented survey of a reptilian host, we found that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes numerically dominated the python gut. In the large intestine, fasting was associated with increased abundances of the genera Bacteroides, Rikenella, Synergistes and Akkermansia, and with reduced overall diversity. A marked postprandial shift in bacterial community configuration occurred. Between 12_h and 3 days after feeding, Firmicutes, including the taxa Clostridium, Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae, gradually outnumbered the fasting-dominant Bacteroidetes, and overall species-level diversity increased significantly. Most lineages seemed to be indigenous to the python rather than ingested with the meal, but a dietary source of Lactobacillus could not be ruled out. Thus, the observed large-scale alterations of the gut microbiota that accompany the Burmese pythons own dramatic physiological and morphological changes during feeding and fasting emphasize the need to consider both microbial and host cellular responses to nutrient flux.

Delivery mode effects on newborn microbiota,"Upon delivery, the neonate is exposed for the first time to a wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and, subsequently, its role in child health, most researchers have focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat, the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates' skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled less than 5 min, and meconium less than 24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Paediatrics'}",{'Pediatrics'}
The ecology of the phyllosphere: geographic and phylogenetic variability in the distribution of bacteria on tree leaves.,"Large populations of bacteria live on leaf surfaces and these phyllosphere bacteria can have important effects on plant health. However, we currently have a limited understanding of bacterial diversity on tree leaves and the inter- and intra specific variability in phyllosphere community structure. We used a barcoded pyrosequencing technique to characterize the bacterial communities from leaves of 56 tree species in Boulder, Colorado, USA, quantifying the intra- and inter-individual variability in the bacterial communities from 10 of these species. We also examined the geographic variability in phyllosphere communities on Pinus ponderosa from several locations across the globe. Individual tree species harboured high levels of bacterial diversity and there was considerable variability in community composition between trees. The bacterial communities were organized in patterns predictable from the relatedness of the trees as there was significant correspondence between tree phylogeny and bacterial community phylogeny. Inter-specific variability in bacterial community composition exceeded intra-specific variability, a pattern that held even across continents where we observed minimal geographic differentiation in the bacterial communities on P. ponderosa needles.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Zoology', 'Ecology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Plot-scale manipulations of organic matter inputs to soils correlate with shifts in microbial community composition in a lowland tropical rain forest,"Little is known about the organisms responsible for decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, or how variations in their relative abundance may influence soil carbon (C) cycling. Here, we altered organic matter in situ by manipulating both litter and through fall inputs to tropical rainforest soils, and then used QPCR and error-corrected bar coded pyrosequencing to investigate how the resulting changes in biogeochemical properties affected microbial community structure. The plot-scale manipulations drove significant changes in microbial community composition: Acidobacteria were present in greater relative abundance in litter removal plots than in double litter plots, while Alphaproteobacteria were found in higher relative abundance in double litter and throughfall reduction plots than in control or litter removal plots. In addition, the bacterial:archaeal ratio was higher in double litter than no litter plots. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated with microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N), and soil N and C pools, while acidobacterial relative abundance was negatively correlated with these same factors. Bacterial:archaeal ratios were positively correlated with soil moisture, total soil C and N, extractable ammonium pools, and soil C:N ratios. Additionally, bacterial:archaeal ratios were positively related to the relative abundance of Actinobateria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and negatively correlated to the relative abundance of Nitrospira and Acidobacteria. Together, our results support the copiotrophic/oligotrophic model of soil heterotrophic microbes suggested by Fierer et al. (2007). Our work also provides new insight into the role of Archaea, and suggests that the majority of Archaea in this tropical rainforest soil may be autotrophic nitrifiers which have a selective advantage when soil C:N ratios are low.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Bacterial community variation in human body habitats across space and time,"Elucidating the biogeography of bacterial communities on the human body is critical for establishing healthy baselines from which to detect differences associated with diseases.

Regulation of myocardial ketone body metabolism by the gut microbiota during nutrient deprivation,"Studies in mice indicate that the gut microbiota promotes energy harvest and storage from components of the diet when these components are plentiful. Here we examine how the microbiota shapes host metabolic and physiologic adaptations to periods of nutrient deprivation. Germ-free (GF) mice and mice who had received a gut microbiota transplant from conventionally raised donors were compared in the fed and fasted states by using functional genomic, biochemical, and physiologic assays. A 24-h fast produces a marked change in gut microbial ecology. Short-chain fatty acids generated from microbial fermentation of available glycans are maintained at higher levels compared with GF controls. During fasting, a microbiota-dependent, Ppar_-regulated increase in hepatic ketogenesis occurs, and myocardial metabolism is directed to ketone body utilization. Analyses of heart rate, hydraulic work, and output, mitochondrial morphology, number, and respiration, plus ketone body, fatty acid, and glucose oxidation in isolated perfused working hearts from GF and colonized animals (combined with in vivo assessments of myocardial physiology) revealed that the fasted GF heart is able to sustain its performance by increasing glucose utilization, but heart weight, measured echocardiographically or as wet mass and normalized to tibial length or lean body weight, is significantly reduced in both fasted and fed mice. This myocardial-mass phenotype is completely reversed in GF mice by consumption of a ketogenic diet. Together, these results illustrate benefits provided by the gut microbiota during periods of nutrient deprivation, and emphasize the importance of further exploring the relationship between gut microbes and cardiovascular health.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metabolomics', 'Cardiology', 'Immunology'}",set()

"Composition, variability, and temporal stability of the intestinal microbiota of the elderly","Alterations in the human intestinal microbiota are linked to conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and obesity. The microbiota also undergoes substantial changes at the extremes of life, in infants and older people, the ramifications of which are still being explored. We applied pyrosequencing of over 40,000 16S rRNA gene V4 region amplicons per subject to characterize the fecal microbiota in 161 subjects aged 65 y and older and 9 younger control subjects. The microbiota of each individual subject constituted a unique profile that was separable from all others. In 68% of the individuals, the microbiota was dominated by phylum Bacteroides, with an average proportion of 57% across all 161 baseline samples. Phylum Firmicutes had an average proportion of 40%. The proportions of some phyla and genera associated with disease or health also varied dramatically, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Faecalibacteria. The core microbiota of elderly subjects was distinct from that previously established for younger adults, with a greater proportion of Bacteroides spp. and distinct abundance patterns of Clostridium groups. Analyses of 26 fecal microbiota datasets from 3-month follow-up samples indicated that in 85% of the subjects, the microbiota composition was more like the corresponding time-0 sample than any other dataset. We conclude that the fecal microbiota of the elderly shows temporal stability over limited time in the majority of subjects but is characterized by unusual phylum proportions and extreme variability.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Geriatric medicine'}",set()
Association between composition of the human gastrointestinal microbiome and development of fatty liver with choline deficiency,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease affects up to 30 percent of the US population, but the mechanisms underlying this condition are incompletely understood. We investigated how diet standardization and choline deficiency influence the composition of the microbial community in the human gastrointestinal tract and the development of fatty liver under conditions of choline deficiency. We performed a 2-month inpatient study of 15 female subjects who were placed on well-controlled diets in which choline levels were manipulated. We used 454-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes to characterize microbiota in stool samples collected over the course of the study. RESULTS:The compositions of the gastrointestinal microbial communities changed with choline levels of diets; each individuals microbiome remained distinct for the duration of the experiment, even though all subjects were fed identical diets. Variations between subjects in levels of Gammaproteobacteria and Erysipelotrichi were directly associated with changes in liver fat in each subject during choline depletion. Levels of these bacteria, change in amount of liver fat, and a single nucleotide polymorphism that affects choline were combined into a model that accurately predicted the degree to which subjects developed fatty liver on a choline-deficient diet. Host factors and gastrointestinal bacteria each respond to dietary choline deficiency, although the gut microbiota remains distinct in each individual.

Incomplete recovery and individualized responses of the human distal gut microbiota to repeated antibiotic perturbation,"The indigenous human microbiota is essential to the health of the host. Although the microbiota can be affected by many features of modern life, we know little about its responses to disturbance, especially repeated disturbances, and how these changes compare to baseline temporal variation. We examined the distal gut microbiota of three individuals over 10 months that spanned two courses of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, analyzing more than 1.7 million bacterial 16S rRNA hypervariable region sequences from 52-56 samples per subject. Inter-individual variation was the major source of variability between samples. Day to day temporal variability was evident but constrained around an average community composition that was stable over several months in the absence of deliberate perturbation. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the gut microbiota was profound and rapid, with a loss of diversity and a shift in community composition occurring within 3-4 days of drug initiation. By one week after the end of each course, communities began to return toward their initial state, but the return was often incomplete. While broadly similar, community changes after ciprofloxacin varied among subjects and between the two courses within subjects. In all subjects, the composition of the gut microbiota stabilized by the end of the experiment, but was altered from its initial state. As with other ecosystems, the human distal gut microbiome at baseline is a dynamic regime with a stable average state. Antibiotic perturbation may cause a shift to an alternative stable state, the full consequences of which remain unknown.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Resistant starches types 2 and 4 have differential effects on the composition of the fecal microbiota in human subjects,"To systematically develop dietary strategies based on resistant starch (RS) that modulate the human gut microbiome, detailed in vivo studies that evaluate the effects of different forms of RS on the community structure and population dynamics of the gut microbiota are necessary. The aim of the present study was to gain a community wide perspective of the effects of RS types 2 (RS2) and 4 (RS4) on the fecal microbiota in human individuals. Ten human subjects consumed crackers for three weeks each containing either RS2, RS4, or native starch in a double-blind, crossover design. Multiplex sequencing of 16S rRNA tags revealed that both types of RS induced several significant compositional alterations in the fecal microbial populations, with differential effects on community structure. RS4 but not RS2 induced phylum-level changes, significantly increasing Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes while decreasing Firmicutes. At the species level, the changes evoked by RS4 were increases in Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Parabacteroides distasonis, while RS2 significantly raised the proportions of Ruminococcus bromii and Eubacterium rectale when compared to RS4. The population shifts caused by RS4 were numerically substantial for several taxa, leading for example, to a ten-fold increase in bifidobacteria in three of the subjects, enriching them to 18-30% of the fecal microbial community. The responses to RS and their magnitudes varied between individuals, and they were reversible and tightly associated with the consumption of RS. Our results demonstrate that RS2 and RS4 show functional differences in their effect on human fecal microbiota composition, indicating that the chemical structure of RS determines its accessibility by groups of colonic bacteria. The findings imply that specific bacterial populations could be selectively targeted by well designed functional carbohydrates, but the inter-subject variations in the response to RS indicates that such strategies might benefit from more personalized approaches.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Taxonomy', 'Nutritional science', 'Microbiology'}",set()
Disordered microbial communities in the upper respiratory tract of cigarette smokers,"Cigarette smokers have an increased risk of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. Some effects of smoking on specific respiratory tract bacteria have been described, but the consequences for global airway microbial community composition have not been determined. Here, we used culture-independent high-density sequencing to analyze the microbiota from the right and left nasopharynx and oropharynx of 29 smoking and 33 nonsmoking healthy asymptomatic adults to assess microbial composition and effects of cigarette smoking. Bacterial communities were profiled using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S sequence tags (803,391 total reads), aligned to 16S rRNA databases, and communities compared using the UniFrac distance metric. A Random Forest machine-learning algorithm was used to predict smoking status and identify taxa that best distinguished between smokers and nonsmokers. Community composition was primarily determined by airway site, with individuals exhibiting minimal side-of-body or temporal variation. Within airway habitats, microbiota from smokers were significantly more diverse than nonsmokers and clustered separately. The distributions of several genera were systematically altered by smoking in both the oro- and nasopharynx, and there was an enrichment of anaerobic lineages associated with periodontal disease in the oropharynx. These results indicate that distinct regions of the human upper respiratory tract contain characteristic microbial communities that exhibit disordered patterns in cigarette smokers, both in individual components and global structure, which may contribute to the prevalence of respiratory tract complications in this population.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Infectious disease'}",set()
Moving pictures of the human microbiome,"Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and malnutrition.

Here we present the largest human microbiota timeseries analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. Results: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, daily fluctuations in an individual's microbiota appear characteristic. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total within body site microbial communities appears to be present across all time points, suggesting that if a core temporal microbiome exists it is small. Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members. DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals.

Soil microbes (bacteria, archaea, and fungi) play key roles in many of the processes that constitute NEONs grand challenge areas. To better understand the biogeography of soil microbes, a prototype was designed to measure temporal and spatial variability in microbial community composition within and among four eco-climatic regions over an annual cycle. The prototype focused on four NEON domains that represent gradients in mean annual temperature and precipitation including Southeast (Domain 3, Florida), Great Basin (Domain 15, Utah), Taiga (Domain 19, Alaska), and Pacific Tropical (Domain 20, Hawaii). Phylogenetic and functional gene analyses were conducted on archived soil core samples collected five times over an annual cycle from four NEON domains. Sequences and analyses of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to identify soil bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversity and community structure were generated through 454 pyrosequencing using titanium protocol. Preliminary results show that communities cluster by eco-region and there is no distinct seasonal trend.

Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative samples from ,"Microbial communities harbor immense genetic diversity with enormous promise for applications in bioproduct synthesis and green chemistry. Metagenomic libraries provide a window into this largely untapped reservoir of nucleic acid diversity and individual libraries have been generated from a variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments. A limitation is that metagenomic libraries are typically project-specific and maintained in isolation. In an effort to enable the sharing of genetic material from environmental samples for the benefit of the scientific community, we are establishing the Canadian MetaMicroBiome Library. This repository will house composite soil samples that are characterized by extensive 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing, generating taxonomic profiles and metabolic pathway reconstructions for each sample. The sequence data will be submitted to existing public databases and linked with detailed physical, chemical and geographic characterization of the samples according to established metagenomic standards. Sample DNA will be used to construct high quality libraries in cosmid vectors, allowing for phenotypic screening in a broad range of microbial surrogate hosts. Phenotypic screening of metagenomic libraries provides access to truly novel functions that would otherwise be missed by sequence-based surveys of bulk community DNA or metagenomic libraries. MetaMicroBiome is being initiated with soil samples collected from across Canada, and initial libraries are being screened for novel glycoside hydrolase activities in multiple surrogate hosts. Once MetaMicroBiome is established, contributions of samples from other environments will be accepted for inclusion.

Microbial eukaryotes in these lakes occupy a variety of trophic levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to tertiary predators. Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic community residing in the photic zone of the east lobe (ELB) and west lobe (WLB) of the chemically stratified Lake Bonney. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) libraries revealed vertically stratified populations dominated by photosynthetic protists, with a cryptophyte dominating shallow populations (ELB-6m; WLB-10m), a haptophyte occupying mid-depths (both lobes 13m) and chlorophytes residing in the deepest layers (ELB-18 and 20m; WLB-15 and 20m) of the photic zone. A previously undetected stramenopile occurred throughout the water column of both lobes. Temporal variation in the eukaryotic populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer (24-h sunlight) to polar night (complete dark). Protist diversity was similar between the two lobes of Lake Bonney due to exchange between the photic zones of the two basins via a narrow bedrock sill. However, vertical and temporal variation in protist distribution occurred, indicating the influence of the unique water chemistry on the biology of the two dry valley watersheds.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Zoology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
NLRP6 inflammasome regulates colonic microbial ecology and risk for colitis,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that function as sensors of endogenous or exogenous damage-associated molecular patterns. Here we show that deficiency of NLRP6 in mouse colonic epithelial cells results in reduced IL-18 levels and an altered fecal microbiota characterized by expanded representation of members of Bacteroidetes (Prevotellaceae). Moreover, NLRP6 inflammasome-deficient mice were characterized by spontaneous intestinal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell recruitment, and exacerbation of chemical colitis induced by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Cross-fostering and co-housing experiments revealed that the colitogenic activity of this microbiota is transferable to neonatal or adult wild-type mice, leading to exacerbation of DSS colitis via induction of CCL5. Antibiotic treatment and electron microscopy studies further supported the role of Prevotellaceae as a key representative of this microbiota-associated phenotype. Altogether, perturbations in this inflammasome pathway, including NLRP6, ASC, Caspase-1 and IL-18 may constitute a predisposing or initiating event in some cases of human IBD.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Immunology', 'Human genetics'}",set()

Diversity of carbonate deposits and basement rocks in continental and marine serpentinite seeps.,"Biogeography of serpentinite-hosted microbial communities Microbial habitats hosted in ultramafic rocks constitute substantial, globally-distributed portions of the subsurface biosphere, occurring both on the continents and beneath the seafloor. The aqueous alteration of ultramafics, in a process known as serpentinization, creates energy rich, high pH conditions, with low concentrations of inorganic carbon which place fundamental constraints upon microbial metabolism and physiology. Despite their importance, very few studies have attempted to directly access and quantify microbial activities and distributions in the serpentinite-hosted ecosystems. We have initiated microbiological studies of alkaline springs and their associated carbonate deposits at three separate continental sites of serpentinization in Newfoundland, Italy, and California, and we are comparing these results to previous analyses of the Lost City hydrothermal field, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We anticipate that the data from these samples will yield insight into the biogeography of serpentinite-hosted microbial communities and provide targets for further investigation of important biogeochemical processes.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",{'Biogeography'}
A microbial clock provides an accurate estimate of the postmortem interval in a mouse model system,"Elucidating the time since death and locating clandestine graves are crucial in many forensic cases, but can often be a challenge. Biotic signatures of corpse decomposition, such as chemicals or the succession of insects, are commonly used to determine the post-mortem interval and to detect grave soil, but no method is successful in every scenario. Therefore, the development of new forensic tools is important. Microbes are ubiquitous in the environment and they play a key role in regulating the speed of decomposition. However, microbial communities are not currently utilized to their full potential as a forensic tool. Testing whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition is crucial for assessing whether microbes can be used as a ""biological clock"" to assess time since death. Powered by advances in culture independent DNA methods and sequencing technologies, recent research has revealed that microbial communities are quantifiable and predictable across habitats such as the human mouth and skin and soil. Thus we performed a laboratory experiment leveraging new sequencing technologies to determine the temporal changes in corpse associated-microbes in which mice were allowed to decompose on soil at ambient temperature for up to 49 days. Samples from the abdominal cavity, skin and gravesoil were collected at regular intervals from 5 corpses per time point. Partial 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced and computational pipelines were used to characterize the succession of bacterial and eukaryotic communities during the decomposition process. For each corpse-associated site, Proteobacteria increased over time, but most notably in the abdominal cavity, a site in which bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae dominated. Furthermore, the decrease in abundance of genera such as Bacteroides and Lactobacillus in the abdominal cavity over time lends support to the long-held hypothesis that decomposition in the abdomen shifts from anaerobes to aerobes or facultative anaerobes after corpse rupture occurs. Importantly, the microbial diversity of grave soil was significantly modified by corpse decomposition. Several genera from the families Enterobacteriaceae and Rhizobiaceae may be important indicators of grave soil. Eukaryotic sequence data revealed that nematodes of the family Rhabditidae dominate the meiofauna of both the corpse and soil during late stages of decomposition. Nematodes of the family Rhabditidae may also serve as an indicator of grave soil. We demonstrate that the vast, but measurable diversity of microbes has great potential for helping forensic scientists estimate the postmortem interval of corpses and locate clandestine gravesites.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Molecular biology'}",{'Forensic science'}

A core gut microbiome in obese and lean twins.,"The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable core microbiome at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genomics', 'Metagenomics'}",{'Obesity'}

Cohabiting family members share microbiota with one another and with their dogs,"Human-associated microbial community composition is highly variable across host individuals, but the sources of this variability remain poorly understood. Previous studies have explored some possible contributing factors such as (genetic) relatedness, diet, and developmental stage. A likely additional cause is that our microbial communities are shaped by our unique surroundings, including the individuals with whom we interact at various stages of life.  To quantify potential microbial exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 159 humans and 36 dogs across 60 families consisting of spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither. Members of the same family, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than did individuals from different households, with an especially strong effect of co-habitation on skin compared to oral or fecal microbiota.  Dog ownership, but not children, had a significant effect on the extent to which cohabiting adults shared skin (forehead and palm) microbiota, and dog-owning adults shared more microbial taxa with each other than with those who did not. Furthermore, adults shared more skin microbiota with their own dogs than with other dogs.

Analysis of gut microbial regulation of host gene expression along the length of the gut and regulation of gut microbial ecology through MyD88,"The gut microbiota has profound effects on host physiology but local hostmicrobial interactions in the gut are only poorly characterized and likely to vary from the sparsely colonized duodenum to the densely colonized colon. Microorganisms are recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, which signal through the adapter molecule MyD88. To identify host responses induced by gut microbiota longitudinally and whether these required MyD88, we compared transcriptional profiles of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon from germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) wildtype and Myd88-/- mice. The gut microbial ecology was assessed by 454- based pyrosequencing and viruses were analyzed by PCR. The gut microbiota modulated expression of a large set of genes in the small intestine and fewer genes in the colon but surprisingly few microbiota-regulated genes required MyD88 signaling. However, MyD88 was essential for microbiota-induced colonic expression of the antimicrobial genes Reg3 in the epithelium, and Myd88 deficiency was associated with both a shift in bacterial diversity and a greater proportion of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. In addition, CONV-R Myd88-/- mice had increased expression of antiviral genes in the colon and were susceptible to norovirus infection. We have identified limited  but selective roles for MyD88 in increasing susceptibility to norovirus infections and modifying microbial ecology.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Immunology'}",set()
The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins,"Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are impacted by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans, and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks prior to, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks following consumption of a commercially-available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied prior to and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP, while only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice following single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, upregulates a locus involved in catabolism of xylo-oligosaccharides in vivo compared to growth in vitro, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this organism and providing mechanistic insight about their potential bifidogenic effects. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism.

Brazelton LostCity chimney biofilm,"The Lost City Hydrothermal Field, an ultramafic-hosted system located 15 km west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has experienced at least 30,000 years of hydrothermal activity. Previous studies have shown that its carbonate chimneys form by mixing of round 90C, pH 9-11 hydrothermal fluids and cold seawater. Flow of methane and hydrogen-rich hydrothermal fluids in the porous interior chimney walls supports an archaeal biofilm dominated by a single phylotype of Methanosarcinales. We have  a collection of 40 carbonate chimney samples, most of which have been dated with uranium-thorium isotopic systematics.  The resulting ages range from 34 to 145,000 years. Previous 16S rRNA pyrotag sequencing of 4 of these samples revealed that rare sequences in young chimneys were often more abundant in older chimneys, indicating that species can remain rare in a chimney for >100 years before blooming and becoming dominant when the environmental conditions allow. These results suggest that a long history of selection over many cycles of chimney growth has resulted in numerous closely related species at Lost City, each of which is pre-adapted to a particular set of re-occurring environmental conditions.

Today, microbialites are found in environments where conditions are often too harsh for most organisms. However, the microbialites in both Pavilion and Kelly lakes have provided a new environment for the scientific community to study. These lakes demonstrate that large and uniquely shaped structures can also occur in non-extreme environments that also support fish, plants and other species. The microbialites of these modern lakes are relevant to our understanding of ancient microbiaites that were once common and diverse on early Earth, as such, Pavilion Lake has become an exciting field site for Earth scientists and astrobiologists who are interested in the application of the PLRP research to the search for life in our solar system and beyond.  The PLRP was founded in 2004, and has grown in exciting new directions ever since. During the 2004 field season, PLRP scientists discovered microbialites in Kelly Lake, which is approximately 20 km NW from Pavilion Lake. The PLRP team will be taking their DeepWorker Science and Exploration (DSE) program to Kelly Lake in 2011. These research activities complement those that have taken place at Pavilion Lake since 2008, and will help to broaden our understanding of modern microbialite-rich environments.

Carbon flow reconstructions based on stable isotopic compositions of whole archaeal cells, intact archaeal membrane lipids, and other sedimentary carbon pools indicate that these Archaea assimilate sedimentary organic compounds other than methane even though methanotrophy accounts for a major fraction of carbon cycled in these ecosystems. Oxidation of methane by members of Marine Benthic Group B and the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group without assimilation of methane carbon provides a plausible explanation. Maintenance energies of these subsurface communities appear to be orders of magnitude lower than minimum values known from laboratory observations, and ecosystem-level carbon budgets suggest that community turnover times are on the order of 100 to 2,000 years.

Bacterial plate counts and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that individuals that are highly attractive to An. gambiae s.s. have a significantly higher abundance, but lower diversity of bacteria on their skin than individuals that are poorly attractive. Bacterial genera that are correlated with the relative degree of attractiveness to mosquitoes were identified.

The effects of soil bacterial community structure on decomposition in a tropical rain forest,"Soil microorganisms are key drivers of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, yet it is still unclear how variations in soil microbial community composition influence many ecosystem processes. We investigated how shifts in bacterial community composition and diversity resulting from differences in carbon (C) availability affect organic matter decomposition by conducting an in situ litter manipulation experiment in a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. We used bar-coded pyrosequencing to characterize soil bacterial community composition in litter manipulation plots and performed a series of laboratory incubations to test the potential functional significance of community shifts on organic matter decomposition. Despite clear effects of the litter manipulation on soil bacterial community composition, the treatments had mixed effects on microbial community function. Distinct communities varied in their ability to decompose a wide range of C compounds, and functional differences were related to both the relative abundance of the two most abundant bacterial sub-phyla (Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) and to variations in bacterial alpha-diversity. However, distinct communities did not differ in their ability to decompose native dissolved organic matter (DOM) substrates that varied in quality or quantity. Our results show that while resource-driven shifts in soil bacterial community composition have the potential to influence decomposition of specific C substrates, those differences may not translate to differences in DOM decomposition rates in situ. Taken together, our results suggest that soil bacterial communities may be either functionally dissimilar or equivalent during decomposition depending on the nature of the organic matter being decomposed.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Tropical medicine', 'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()

Dog and human inflammatory bowel disease rely on overlapping yet distinct dysbiosis networks,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune condition that is difficult to diagnose.

A dysbiosis index trained on humans fails when applied to dogs, but a dog-specific dysbiosis index achieves high correlations with the overall dog microbial community beta diversity patterns. In addition, a random forests classifier trained on dog-specific samples achieves high discriminatory power (AUC = 0.93), even when using stool samples rather than the mucosal biopsies required for high discriminatory power in humans. These relationships were not detected in previously published dog IBD datasets due to their limited sample size and statistical power.

By both analyses female tick microbiomes were significantly less diverse than those of male ticks. The dissimilarity between tick microbiomes increased with distance between sites and the state in which a tick was collected could be inferred from its microbiota. The genus Rickettsia was prominent in all locations. Borrelia was also present in most locations, and was especially high in one site in Western Virginia. In contrast, Enterobacteriaceae was very common in North Carolina I. scapularis but uncommon in I. scapularis from other sites or in North Carolina I. affinis.

Perinatal Bisphenol A Exposure Induces Chronic Inflammation in Rabbit Offspring via Modulation of Gut Bacteria and Their Metabolites,"PBisphenol A (BPA) accumulates in the maturing gut and liver in utero and is known to alter gut bacterial profiles in offspring. Gut bacterial dysbiosis may contribute to chronic colonic and systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that perinatal BPA exposure-induced intestinal (and liver) inflammation in offspring is due to alterations in the microbiome and colonic metabolome. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis revealed differences in beta diversity with a significant reduction in the relative abundances of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers such as Oscillospira and Ruminococcaceae due to BPA exposure. Furthermore, BPA exposure reduced fecal SCFA levels and increased systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. BPA exposure-increased intestinal permeability was ameliorated by the addition of SCFA in vitro. Metabolic fingerprints revealed alterations in global metabolism and amino acid metabolism.

The field study was conducted on 24 experimental plots on a loam soil of Fagna, Tuscany (Italy), where soil samples were collected at four different layers of 10 cm each, up to a total depth of 40 cm (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm in triplicate) and of 20 cm (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from continuous and rotating maize fields respectively, in order to measure the effect of the different tillage practices on soil organic matter, microbial diversity and microbial activity.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Agricultural science'}",set()
"Human gut microbiome differentiation viewed across cultures, ages and families illumina","Gut microbial communities represent one source of human genetic and metabolic diversity. To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Immunology'}",set()

"Space, time and change: Investigations of soil bacterial diversity and its drivers in the Mongolian steppe","How the microbial ecology of the Mongolian Steppe shifts with climate change is a central question under investigation in the five-year PIRE Mongolia Project (Partnerships in International Research and Education, mongolia.bio.upenn.edu). Through this project, plant ecologists, biogeochemists, soil scientists, and climate modelers, are empirically documenting the effects of climate and land-use change on this arid ecosystem. Though many global change studies strive to link ecosystem shifts to microbial mechanisms, few have integrated edaphic, floristic and climatic data with microbial community data produced by Next-Generation Sequencing techniques, as is being done in the PIRE Mongolia Project. Moreover, the experimental design is comparable to numerous other climate change studies, allowing for the production of globally relevant data. Presently, 16S pyrosequencing data is being analyzed from the soil microbial community of this well replicated, multi-factorial experiment, which includes warming, watering, grazing and topography treatments. The average annual temperature at the Lake Hvsgl Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site has increased by 1.7C since 1963, and some of the greatest projected increases in temperature are associated with northern Mongolia. Hence, this site is therefore ideally suited for studying ecological shifts driven by climate change. One of the initial hypotheses in this moisture-limited system is that microbial diversity will decrease with warming and increase with watering. In order to unravel the microbial community composition of the system, 16S data will be integrated with spatial and temporal data that includes information on carbon and nitrogen fluxes, changes in plant phenology and shifts in climate.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Environmental Sciences', 'Microbial Ecology'}"

Host remodeling of the gut microbiome and metabolic changes during pregnancy,"Many of the immune and metabolic changes occurring during normal pregnancy also describe metabolic syndrome. Gut microbiota can cause symptoms of metabolic syndrome in nonpregnant hosts. Here, to explore their role in pregnancy, we characterized fecal bacteria of 91 pregnant women of varying prepregnancy BMIs and gestational diabetes status and their infants. Similarities between infant-mother microbiotas increased with children's age, and the infant microbiota was unaffected by mother's health status. Gut microbiota changed dramatically from first (T1) to third (T3) trimesters, with vast expansion of diversity between mothers, an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and reduced richness. T3 stool showed strongest signs of inflammation and energy loss; however, microbiome gene repertoires were constant between trimesters. When transferred to germ-free mice, T3 microbiota induced greater adiposity and insulin insensitivity compared to T1. Our findings indicate that host-microbial interactions that impact host metabolism can occur and may be beneficial in pregnancy.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Metabolomics'}",{'Pregnancy'}

Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria in marine environments: widespread occurrence but low diversity,"The respiratory reduction of nitrate (denitrification) is acknowledged as the most important process that converts biologically available nitrogen to gaseous dinitrogen (N2) in marine ecosystems. Observations during the last decade, however, indicate that anaerobic ammonium oxidation by nitrite (anammox) may be an important pathway for N2 formation and N removal in coastal marine sediments and in anoxic water columns of the oceans (e.g. Hulth et al., 2005). For about a decade we have explored this mechanism during N mineralization by a wide range of biogeochemical and molecular tools including e.g. benthic flux measurements and high resolution imaging of solute distributions, 15N amendments (single and coupled additions of 15NH4+, 14NO3- and 15NO3-), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and qualitative and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (e.g. Brandsma et al., 2011; Schmid et al., 2007; Engstrom et al., 2005; Jetten et al., 2003). The present study focuses on benthic N-cycling in the deepest trough of a Swedish fjord where the anammox reaction contributes up to 79% of total N2 production. The relative importance of anammox for N2 release was directly correlated with a variety of biogeochemical parameters. The observed correlations indicated a competition between reductants for pore water nitrite during early diagenesis, and that additional factors (e.g. availability of Mn-oxides), superimposed on overall patterns of diagenetic activity, are important for determining absolute and relative rates of anammox in coastal marine sediments. Insight in the metagenome of the microbial community in this complex benthic environment would provide complementary and critical information to further understand N cycling in marine environments.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Cell biology', 'Environmental sciences', 'Marine biology'}",set()
Inflammasome-mediated dysbiosis regulates progression of NAFLD and obesity,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. 20vper cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD or NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different animal models reveal that inflammasome deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic TNF-alpha expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient animals to wild type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Gastroenterology', 'Biochemistry'}",set()
Biological oxygen demand optode analysis of coral reef-associated microbial communities exposed to algal exudates.,"Coral competition with benthic algae has been shown to alter the bacterial communities associated with the coral. Certain groups of algae lead to an increase in potential pathogens, potentially shifting the competitive advantage away from the coral and to the alga, while others do not. Here we investigate the changes in the viral communities associated with corals competing with different types of benthic algae to determine if similar changes occur in the viral component of the coral holobiont. We expect that algae that cause stress to corals will lead to the induction of eukaryotic viruses (e.g. infecting coral and/or zooxanthellae) and pathogen-associated phage, while algae that are inferior competitors to corals will not.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Metagenomics', 'Environmental sciences', 'Immunology'}",set()

Seasonal restructuring of the ground squirrel gut microbiota over the annual hibernation cycle,"Many hibernating mammals suspend food intake during winter, relying solely on stored lipids to fuel metabolism. Winter fasting in these species eliminates a major source of degradable substrates to support growth of gut microbes, which may affect microbial community structure and host-microbial interactions. We explored the effect of the annual hibernation cycle on gut microbiotas using deep sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from ground squirrel cecal contents. Squirrel microbiotas were dominated by members of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia. UniFrac analysis showed that microbiotas clustered strongly by season, and maternal influences, diet history, host age, and host body temperature had minimal effects. Phylogenetic diversity and numbers of operational taxonomic units were lowest in late winter and highest in the spring after a 2-wk period of refeeding. Hibernation increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia, phyla that contain species capable of surviving on host-derived substrates such as mucins, and reduced relative abundance of Firmicutes, many of which prefer dietary polysaccharides. Hibernation reduced cecal short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and increased and decreased concentrations of acetate and butyrate, respectively. These results indicate that the ground squirrel microbiota is restructured each year in a manner that reflects differences in microbial preferences for dietary vs. host-derived substrates, and thus the competitive abilities of different taxa to survive in the altered environment in the hibernator gut.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Ecology'}",{'Seasonal biology'}
Examining the global distribution of dominant archaeal populations in soil,"Archaea, primarily Crenarchaeota, are common in soil, however the structure of soil archaeal communities and the factors regulating their diversity and abundance remain poorly understood. Here, we used barcoded pyrosequencing to comprehensively survey archaeal and bacterial communities in 146 soils, representing a multitude of soil and ecosystem types from across the globe. Relative archaeal abundance, the percentage of all 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered that were archaeal, averaged 2 percent across all soils and ranged from 0 percent to greater than 10 percent in individual soils. Soil Carbon to Nitrogen ratio was the only factor consistently correlated with archaeal relative abundances, being higher in soils with lower C:N ratios. Soil archaea communities were dominated by just two phylotypes from a constrained clade within the Crenarchaeota, which together accounted for greater than 70 percent of all archaeal sequences obtained in the survey. As one of these phylotypes was closely related to a previously identified putative ammonia oxidizer, we sampled from two long-term nitrogen  addition experiments to determine if this taxon responds to experimental manipulations of N availability. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of this dominant taxon, as well as archaea overall, tended to decline with increasing N. This trend was coupled with a concurrent increase in known N-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting competitive interactions between these groups.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Genetics', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Bacterial communities associated with the lichen symbiosis,"Lichens are commonly described as a mutualistic symbiosis between fungi and ""algae"" (Chlorophyta or Cyanobacteria); however, they also have internal bacterial communities. Recent research suggests that lichen-associated microbes are an integral component of lichen thalli and that the classical view of this symbiotic relationship should be expanded to include bacteria. However, we still have a limited understanding of the phylogenetic structure of these communities and their variability across lichen species. To address these knowledge gaps, we used bar-coded pyrosequencing to survey the bacterial communities associated with lichens. Bacterial sequences obtained from four lichen species at multiple locations on rock outcrops suggested that each lichen species harbored a distinct community and that all communities were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria. Across all samples, we recovered numerous bacterial phylotypes that were closely related to sequences isolated from lichens in prior investigations, including those from a lichen-associated Rhizobiales lineage (LAR1; putative N(2) fixers). LAR1-related phylotypes were relatively abundant and were found in all four lichen species, and many sequences closely related to other known N(2) fixers (e.g., Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, and Frankia) were recovered. Our findings confirm the presence of highly structured bacterial communities within lichens and provide additional evidence that these bacteria may serve distinct functional roles within lichen symbioses.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Biodiversity'}",set()
Latitudinal surveys of algal-associated microorganisms,"Over the last decade, disease has emerged from being a long overlooked factor in natural communities to become an increasing focus for ecological research in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. There is also major concern that global warming and other anthropogenic stressors may be responsible for the spread of pathogens, enhanced virulence and decreased resilience of hosts. This project focuses on macroalgae or seaweeds, the dominant habitat-forming organisms in temperate rocky reef communities worldwide. They are the trees of temperate coastal ecosystems.  Anthropogenic stressors can have dramatic effects on the health and persistence of large macroalgae and are responsible for extensive losses of habitat-forming algae. Importantly, declines in habitat-forming macroalgae not only impact the algae themselves, but have major effects on the diversity and abundance of associated organisms. During this project, we aim to characterise microbial communities associated with the surfaces of dominant seaweed species on temperate Australian coasts, from northern New South Wales, south to Tasmania and also along the western Australian coastline. Furthermore, we aim to identify potential pathogens associated with stressed specimens and quantify their abundance at different sites and different times and correlate microbial data with various physico-chemical information from each site and specimen. This work will provide baseline data on algal-bacterial associations on a latitudinal scale and may also provide information on the distribution and abundance of potential algal pathogens. We hope also to understand how different environmental conditions influence algal-associated microorganisms and predict how environmental change may affect interactions between these microbes and their hosts.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Plant biology', 'Microbial ecology', 'Environmental sciences'}",set()
Soil bacterial and fungal communities across a pH gradient in an arable soil,"Soils collected across a long-term liming experiment (pH 4.0-8.3), in which variation in factors other than pH have been minimized, were used to investigate the direct influence of pH on the abundance and composition of the two major soil microbial taxa, fungi and bacteria. We hypothesized that bacterial communities would be more strongly influenced by pH than fungal communities. To determine the relative abundance of bacteria and fungi, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR), and to analyze the composition and diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities, we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. Both the relative abundance and diversity of bacteria were positively related to pH, the latter nearly doubling between pH 4 and 8. In contrast, the relative abundance of fungi was unaffected by pH and fungal diversity was only weakly related with pH. The composition of the bacterial communities was closely defined by soil pH; there was as much variability in bacterial community composition across the 180-m distance of this liming experiment as across soils collected from a wide range of biomes in North and South America, emphasizing the dominance of pH in structuring bacterial communities. The apparent direct influence of pH on bacterial community composition is probably due to the narrow pH ranges for optimal growth of bacteria. Fungal community composition was less strongly affected by pH, which is consistent with pure culture studies, demonstrating that fungi generally exhibit wider pH ranges for optimal growth.",gpt-3.5-turbo,"{'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}",{'Soil biology'}
