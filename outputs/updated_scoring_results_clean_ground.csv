ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Human biology', 'Infectious disease', 'Bioengineering', 'Agricultural science', 'Human genetics', 'Plant biology', 'Proteins', 'Machine learning', 'Bioinformatics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genomics', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.1,0.16666666666666666,0.2,"{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Human biology', 'Bioengineering', 'Infectious disease', 'Agricultural science', 'Human genetics', 'Protein binding sites', 'Plant biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Machine learning', 'Genomics'}",0.8696241754277474,0.8064516129032258,0.7246868128564562,0.8333333333333334,0.8333333333333334

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Model organisms', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Cell biology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Embryology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Developmental biology', 'Animal study', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.16666666666666666,0.2,0.5,"{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Chemistry', 'Model organisms', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Cell biology', 'Systems medicine', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Embryology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA'}",0.9648989898989905,0.13793103448275862,0.3859595959595962,0.4,0.4

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Microbiology', 'Open science', 'Carbon cycle', 'Genomics', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.16666666666666666,0.2,0.5,"{'Proteins', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Chemistry', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Membrane and lipoproteins', 'Microbiology', 'Open science', 'Genomics', 'Gene regulation'}",0.951851851851852,0.5,0.3807407407407408,0.4,0.4

ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal::8SDAGTmv,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'RNA', 'Critical care medicine', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.16666666666666666,0.3,0.2727272727272727,"{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Cell culture collection', 'RNA', 'Critical care medicine', 'Gene regulation'}",0.9298752834467123,1.6666666666666667,0.0,1.1,False

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Rare diseases', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA'}",set(),0.05555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.1,"{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Sequence analysis', 'Rare diseases', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Proteins', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA'}",0.8153679653679657,0.8,0.0,1.1111111111111112,False

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged.

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells.

The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm.

We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins.

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Human biology', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Protein variants', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Protein binding sites'}",set(),0.11764705882352941,0.2222222222222222,0.2,"{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Protein variants', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein binding sites'}",0.8925461959675647,1.1304347826086956,0.0,1.1111111111111112,False

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'RNA', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence analysis', 'Gene transcripts', 'Zoology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Proteins', 'Embryology', 'Neurology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.2222222222222222,0.3076923076923077,0.4444444444444444,"{'DNA mutation', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA', 'Biology'}","{'Sequence analysis', 'Gene transcripts', 'Zoology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Epigenetics', 'Proteins', 'Embryology', 'Neurology', 'Laboratory animal science'}",0.990171556838224,0.5,0.6855033855033859,0.6923076923076923,0.6923076923076923

In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Small molecules', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.23529411764705882,0.2857142857142857,0.5714285714285714,"{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Human genetics', 'Zoology', 'Small molecules', 'Mouse clinic', 'Proteins', 'Preclinical and clinical studies', 'Cell culture collection', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA'}",1.005135387488329,1.0,0.5025676937441645,0.5,0.5

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Transcriptomics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'RNA', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.14285714285714285,0.25,0.25,"{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Human biology', 'Human genetics', 'Microbial ecology', 'Microbiology', 'RNA', 'Transcriptomics'}",0.9032539682539684,1.0,0.9032539682539684,1.0,1.0

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Transcriptomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene structure', 'Comparative genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Proteins', 'Genetic variation', 'Genomics', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.29411764705882354,0.4166666666666667,0.5,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Structural biology', 'Microbiology', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Sequence analysis', 'Gene transcripts', 'Gene structure', 'Comparative genomics', 'Plant biology', 'Genetic variation', 'Genomics'}",1.038392023476057,2.111111111111111,0.8653266862300476,0.8333333333333334,0.8333333333333334

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Embryology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Cell culture collection', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.15789473684210525,0.1875,0.5,"{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype'}","{'Regenerative medicine', 'Human biology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human genetics', 'Synthetic biology', 'Zoology', 'Cell biology', 'Proteins', 'Drug metabolism', 'Embryology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Cell culture collection', 'Protein binding sites'}",0.9562889352363042,0.21875,0.3586083507136141,0.375,0.375

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Gene expression', 'Protein variants', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'DNA binding sites', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Animal study', 'Virology', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.05,0.1,0.09090909090909091,"{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Immunoproteins and antigens', 'Gene expression', 'Protein variants', 'Pathology', 'Cell culture collection', 'DNA binding sites', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Virology', 'Gene regulation'}",0.8117724867724868,2.375,0.0,1.1,False

Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects.

Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Pathology', 'Animal study'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Animal study', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein binding sites', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.08333333333333333,0.14285714285714285,0.16666666666666666,"{'Genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Pathology'}","{'Gene expression', 'Zoology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Protein binding sites', 'Genomic imprinting'}",0.8601851851851854,2.0,0.7373015873015875,0.8571428571428571,0.8571428571428571

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories.

Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001).

We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases.

To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes.

Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm.

We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Genetics', 'Infectious disease', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Virology', 'Proteomics'}","{'Signal transduction', 'Phosphorylation', 'Host-pathogen interaction'}",0.058823529411764705,0.14285714285714285,0.09090909090909091,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Infectious disease', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Virology', 'Proteomics'}",0.8144672683888374,0.6071428571428571,0.0,1.5714285714285714,False
gpt-3.5-turbo,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Molecular biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Oncology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Immunology', 'Proteomics'}",set(),0.1875,0.3333333333333333,0.3,"{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Oncology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}",0.9270282186948857,0.38461538461538464,0.0,1.1111111111111112,False

Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates.

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

gpt-3.5-turbo,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Developmental biology', 'Drug development', 'RNA', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Epigenetics', 'Neurobiology', 'Embryology', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'RNA-Seq', 'Epigenetic determinant', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'Methylcytosine dioxygenase', 'Neural tube defects', 'Craniofacial development'}",0.3333333333333333,0.5714285714285714,0.4444444444444444,"{'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Drug development', 'RNA', 'Biology'}","{'Neurobiology', 'Embryology', 'Epigenetics'}",1.0793169793169792,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.2857142857142858,False

In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations.

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Genomics'}","{'Chemokine receptor', 'Migration', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'Cancer', 'Metastasis', 'Tumor suppressor', 'MicroRNA', 'Therapeutic targets'}",0.09090909090909091,0.2,0.14285714285714285,"{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Genomics'}",0.8208363395863395,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1.4,False

However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Systems biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}","{'Drug target predictions', 'Genetic network engineering', 'Antibiotic resistance'}",0.08333333333333333,0.2,0.125,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Genomics', 'Systems biology', 'Bioinformatics'}",0.8414021164021166,0.2,0.0,1.6,False

gpt-4,"Pea powdery mildew (PM) is an important fungal disease caused by an obligate biotroph, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), which significantly impacts pea production worldwide. The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Evolutionary biology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Chemistry', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Gene regulation', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics'}","{'Comparative genomics', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Evolutionary biology'}",0.7773261717706164,1.25,0.0,3.3333333333333335,False
gpt-4,"Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization<sup>1,2</sup>. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biochemistry'}",set(),0.1111111111111111,0.25,0.16666666666666666,"{'Gene expression', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Biochemistry', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology'}",0.8203439153439154,0.15384615384615385,0.0,1.5,False

gpt-4,"The utilization of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is an important component of local and global carbon cycles that is characterized by tight linkages between methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) and nonmethanotrophic bacteria. It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Gene expression', 'Personalised medicine', 'Haematology', 'Molecular biology', 'Immunogenetics'}",set(),0.125,0.2,0.25,"{'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Molecular biology', 'Personalised medicine', 'Haematology', 'Immunogenetics'}",0.863260582010582,1.0,0.6906084656084657,0.8,0.8

gpt-4,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) quickly adapt to new environments and are well known to cross species barriers. To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Genomics', 'Parasitology'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Parasitology', 'Genomics', 'Gene regulation'}",0.7550661375661382,0.875,0.0,1.8333333333333333,False
gpt-4,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Genetics', 'Infectious disease', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Microbiology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics'}",set(),0.0625,0.14285714285714285,0.1,"{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Infectious disease', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Microbiology', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcriptomics'}",0.8036322216877774,0.6875,0.0,1.4285714285714286,False

Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells.

It is related to Candida albicans, which remains the most common cause of candidiasis disease in humans. The transcription factor Bcr1 is an important regulator of biofilm formation in vitro in both C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis. Our data suggest that the role of the CFEM family in iron acquisition is conserved between C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but their role in biofilm formation is not.","{'Genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Pathology', 'Animal study'}","{'Human biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}","{'Data analysis', 'Genetically engineering', 'Cancer research'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Pathology', 'Animal study'}","{'Human biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'DNA mutation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}",0.7616402116402116,0.5,0.7616402116402116,1.0,1.0

Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione. Among several metabolites formed, 2-amino-4-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid (AMBA) accumulated in the medium. Although sulcotrione has a chemical structure closely resembling that of mesotrione, the isolates were unable to degrade it.","{'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Infectious disease', 'Systems biology', 'Virology', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Molecular genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biochemistry', 'Genomics', 'Proteomics'}","{'Molecular interactions, pathways and networks'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Microbial ecology', 'Ecology', 'Microbiology', 'Environmental sciences'}","{'Infectious disease', 'Systems biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Genomics', 'Molecular genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biochemistry', 'Virology', 'Proteomics'}",0.7222883597883598,0.5,0.2626503126503127,0.36363636363636365,0.36363636363636365

gpt-4,"Chocolate Pots hot springs (CP) is a unique, circumneutral pH, iron-rich, geothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park. Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR. Gene (protein) searches revealed the presence of heat-shock proteins that may be involved in increased thermotolerance in the organisms present in the enrichments as well as porin-cytochrome complexes previously shown to be involved in extracellular electron transport.

We generated B-cell associated gene-signatures (BAGS) based on six naturally occurring B-cell subsets within normal bone marrow. Our hypothesis is that by segregating CLL according to BAGS, we can identify subtypes with prognostic implications in support of pathogenetic value of BAGS. Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Functional genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Plant biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Proteomics'}",set(),0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Functional genomics', 'Agricultural science', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Plant biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Transcriptomics'}",0.77569715007215,0.17647058823529413,0.2820716909353273,0.36363636363636365,0.36363636363636365

To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Gene expression', 'Functional genomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}",set(),0.08333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.14285714285714285,"{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Functional genomics', 'Comparative genomics', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics'}",0.8461008898508897,1.0,0.0,1.1666666666666667,False

However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa.

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns.

Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors.

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear.

Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Embryology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genomics', 'Paediatrics', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),0.14285714285714285,0.2,0.3333333333333333,"{'Animal study', 'Sequence assembly', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene expression'}","{'Cell biology', 'Biomedical science', 'Embryology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Developmental biology', 'Biology', 'Genomics', 'Paediatrics'}",0.8629676870748302,0.21739130434782608,0.5177806122448981,0.6,0.6

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth.

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Pharmacology', 'Sequence analysis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biochemistry', 'Data visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Genetics', 'Database management', 'Molecular biology', 'Biophysics', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Data mining', 'Small molecules', 'Computational biology', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biomedical science', 'Biotechnology', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Computational chemistry', 'Structural genomics'}","{'Biochemical research', 'Lab animal science techniques', 'Research administration and management', 'Biochemical techniques and instrumentation', 'Translational research'}",0.15625,0.19230769230769232,0.45454545454545453,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Human biology', 'Chemistry', 'Physiology', 'Proteins', 'Animal study'}","{'Bioinformatics', 'Data visualisation', 'Genomics', 'Database management', 'Molecular biology', 'Biophysics', 'Machine learning', 'Computer science', 'Data mining', 'Small molecules', 'Computational biology', 'Cryogenic electron microscopy', 'Ontology and terminology', 'Infectious disease', 'Microbial ecology', 'Biomedical science', 'Biotechnology', 'Analytical chemistry', 'Microbiology', 'Computational chemistry', 'Structural genomics'}",0.8819284434203791,0.6756756756756757,0.37312357221631426,0.4230769230769231,0.4230769230769231
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Activating mutations in JAK1 have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Biomarkers', 'Systems medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Biomedical science', 'Omics', 'Oncology', 'Biotherapeutics', 'Immunology'}","{'Immune function', 'Biologics and pharmaceuticals', 'Neurology/central nervous system'}",0.058823529411764705,0.125,0.1,"{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics'}","{'Biomarkers', 'Systems medicine', 'Biotechnology', 'Biomedical science', 'Omics', 'Oncology', 'Biotherapeutics'}",0.78155652833524,0.2857142857142857,0.0,1.25,False
mixtral-8x7b-model,"DNA recombination is required for effective segregation and diversification of genomes and for the successful completion of meiosis. Recent studies in various species hybrids have demonstrated a genetic link between DNA recombination and speciation. Consistent with this, we observed a striking suppression of recombination in the hybrids between two nematodes, the hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis briggsae and the gonochoristic C. nigoni. To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes. The new genomes and genomic libraries form invaluable resources for studying genome evolution, hybrid incompatibilities and sex evolution for this pair of model species.","{'Genetics', 'DNA replication and recombination', 'Animal study'}","{'Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Bioinformatics'}",set(),0.2,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,"{'DNA replication and recombination', 'Animal study'}","{'Genomics', 'Bioinformatics'}",0.9047619047619047,1.0,0.9047619047619047,1.0,1.0

Th17 cells essentially limit mucosal invasion by commensal <i>Candida</i> spp. Here, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the developmental lack of Th17 cell responses in circulating blood neonatal T cells. Naive cord blood CD4 T cells stimulated in Th17-differentiating conditions inherently produced high levels of the interleukin-22 immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly in the presence of neonatal antigen-presenting cells. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing neonatal and adult naïve CD4 T cells <i>ex vivo</i> revealed major developmental differences in gene networks regulating Small Drosophila Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. These changes were functionally validated by experiments showing that the requirement for TGF-β in human Th17 cell differentiation is age-dependent. Moreover, STAT3 activity was profoundly diminished while overexpression of the <i>STAT3</i> gene restored Th17 cell differentiation capacity in neonatal T cells. These data reveal that Th17 cell responses are developmentally regulated at the gene expression level in human neonates. These developmental changes may protect newborns against pathological Th17 cell responses, at the same time increasing their susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis.","{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology'}","{'Database management', 'Data security', 'Data mining', 'Data management', 'Data quality management', 'Data rescue', 'Data governance', 'Data visualisation', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data identity and mapping'}","{'Data architecture', 'Data submission', 'analysis and design', 'annotation', 'and curation', 'Data architecture, analysis and design'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,"{'Genetics', 'Human biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunology'}","{'Database management', 'Data security', 'Data mining', 'Data management', 'Data quality management', 'Data rescue', 'Data governance', 'Data visualisation', 'Data integration and warehousing', 'Data identity and mapping'}",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.4

Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses uncovered a PAX6/DLX5 transcriptional program driving WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells (GdECs). GdECs recruit existing endothelial cells to promote peritumoral satellite lesions, which serve as a niche supporting the growth of invasive glioma cells away from the primary tumor. Clinical data reveal higher WNT5A and GdECs expression in peritumoral and recurrent GBMs relative to matched intratumoral and primary GBMs, respectively, supporting WNT5A-mediated GSC differentiation and invasive growth in disease recurrence.

mixtral-8x7b-model,"Genetic variations affecting neural tube closure along the head result in malformations of the face and brain. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Bioengineering', 'Cell biology', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene structure', 'Immunogenetics', 'Epigenetics', 'Pathology', 'Neurology', 'Developmental biology', 'Gene regulation', 'Laboratory information management', 'Laboratory animal science', 'RNA', 'Gene transcripts', 'Biomedical science', 'DNA mutation', 'Biotechnology', 'Neurobiology'}",set(),0.2222222222222222,0.25,0.6666666666666666,"{'Gene expression', 'Animal study', 'Drug development'}","{'Bioengineering', 'Gene transcripts', 'Epigenomics', 'Laboratory information management', 'Gene structure', 'Cell biology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Biomedical science', 'Biotechnology', 'Epigenetics', 'Neurobiology', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Pathology', 'Neurology', 'Laboratory animal science', 'Biochemistry', 'Genomics', 'Transcriptomics'}",0.9607234813117169,0.5,0.36027130549189385,0.375,0.375

We show here that C. parapsilosis Bcr1 is required for in vivo biofilm development in a rat catheter model, like C. albicans. By comparing the transcription profiles of a bcr1 deletion in both species we found that regulation of expression of the CFEM family is conserved. In C. albicans, three of the five CFEM cell wall proteins (Rbt5, Pga7 and Csa1) are associated with both biofilm formation and acquisition of iron from heme, which is an important virulence characteristic. In C. parapsilosis, the CFEM family has undergone an expansion to 7 members. Expression of three genes (CFEM2, CFEM3, and CFEM6) is dependent on Bcr1, and is induced in low iron conditions. All three are involved in the acquisition of iron from heme. However, deletion of the three CFEM genes has no effect on biofilm formation in C. parapsilosis.

Prior research at CP has focused on photosynthetically driven Fe(II) oxidation as a model for mineralization of microbial mats and deposition of Archean banded iron formations. However, geochemical and stable Fe isotopic data have suggested that dissimilatory microbial iron reduction (DIR) may be active within CP deposits. In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes from enrichment cultures showed dominant sequences closely affiliated with Geobacter metallireducens, a mesophilic Fe(III) oxide reducer. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of enrichment cultures confirmed the presence of a dominant G. metallireducens-like population and other less dominant populations from the phylum Ignavibacteriae, which appear to be capable of DIR.

Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Sequence analysis', 'Cell biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Genetic variation', 'Genomics', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Transcriptomics', 'Genetics', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Gene structure', 'Molecular biology', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Medicine', 'Virology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Biomedical science', 'Proteins'}",set(),0.04,0.05263157894736842,0.14285714285714285,"{'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Proteomics', 'Sequence analysis', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Virology', 'Genomic imprinting', 'Gene structure', 'Cell biology', 'Molecular biology', 'Transcription factors and regulatory sites', 'Biomedical science', 'Regulatory affairs', 'Proteins', 'Medicine', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genetic variation', 'Genomics', 'Medical biotechnology', 'Transcriptomics'}",0.7927339218515695,0.6451612903225806,0.2920598659453151,0.3684210526315789,0.3684210526315789
mixtral-8x7b-model,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'Functional genomics', 'Computer science', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genetic variation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Genomics'}",set(),0.2,0.3,0.375,"{'Medicinal chemistry', 'Pharmacology', 'Chemistry', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Functional genomics', 'Computer science', 'Molecular biology', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genetic variation', 'Biology', 'Genomics'}",0.9635155122655126,0.25,0.7708124098124101,0.8,0.8

The phytopathogen secretes a plethora of effectors, primarily through specialized infection structures termed haustoria, to establish a dynamic relationship with its host. To identify Ep effector candidates, a cDNA library of enriched haustoria from Ep-infected pea leaves was sequenced. The Ep transcriptome encodes 622 Ep candidate secreted proteins (CSPs), of which 167 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Ep CSEPs are highly diverse, but, unlike cereal PM CSEPs, exhibit extensive sequence similarity with effectors from other PMs. Quantitative real-time PCR of a subset of EpCSEP/CSPs revealed that the majority are preferentially expressed in haustoria and exhibit infection stage-specific expression patterns. The functional roles of EpCSEP001, EpCSEP009 and EpCSP083 were probed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) via a double-stranded (ds) RNA-mediated RNAi approach. Foliar application of individual EpCSEP/CSP dsRNAs resulted in a marked reduction in PM disease symptoms. These findings were consistent with microscopic and molecular studies, suggesting that these Ep CSEP/CSPs play important roles in pea PM pathogenesis. Homology modelling revealed that EpCSEP001 and EpCSEP009 are analogous to fungal ribonucleases and belong to the RALPH family of effectors. This is the first study to identify and functionally validate candidate effectors from the agriculturally relevant pea PM, and highlights the utility of transcriptomics and HIGS to elucidate the key proteins associated with Ep pathogenesis.","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Transcriptomics', 'Microbiology', 'Proteins', 'Structural biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations<sup>2</sup>. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.","{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Sequence assembly', 'Gene expression', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotroph MDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","{'Gene expression', 'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Pharmacology'}","{'Proteins', 'Carbon cycle', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

To reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena, we compared the Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphoproteomes of murine lung epithelial cells early and late after infection with mouse-adapted SC35M virus or its nonadapted SC35 counterpart. With this analysis we identified a large set of upregulated Ser/Thr phosphorylations common to both viral genotypes, while Tyr phosphorylations showed little overlap. Most of the proteins undergoing massive changes of phosphorylation in response to both viruses regulate chromatin structure, RNA metabolism, and cell adhesion, including a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-regulated network mediating the regulation of actin dynamics. IAV also affected phosphorylation of activation loops of 37 protein kinases, including FAK and several phosphatases, many of which were not previously implicated in influenza virus infection. Inhibition of FAK proved its contribution to IAV infection. Novel phosphorylation sites were found on IAV-encoded proteins, and the functional analysis of selected phosphorylation sites showed that they either support (NA Ser178) or inhibit (PB1 Thr223) virus propagation. Together, these data allow novel insights into IAV-triggered regulatory phosphorylation circuits and signaling networks.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with IAVs leads to the induction of complex signaling cascades, which apparently serve two opposing functions. On the one hand, the virus highjacks cellular signaling cascades in order to support its propagation; on the other hand, the host cell triggers antiviral signaling networks. Here we focused on IAV-triggered phosphorylation events in a systematic fashion by deep sequencing of the phosphoproteomes. This study revealed a plethora of newly phosphorylated proteins. We also identified 37 protein kinases and a range of phosphatases that are activated or inactivated following IAV infection. Moreover, we identified new phosphorylation sites on IAV-encoded proteins. Some of these phosphorylations support the enzymatic function of viral components, while other phosphorylations are inhibitory, as exemplified by PB1 Thr223 modification. Our global characterization of IAV-triggered patterns of phospho-proteins provides a rich resource to further understand host responses to infection at the level of phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks.","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Sequence analysis', 'Human biology', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Molecular genetics', 'Proteins', 'Animal study', 'Biochemistry'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Immunogenetics', 'DNA mutation', 'Physiology', 'Animal study', 'Immunoinformatics', 'Immunology'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

To unravel the molecular basis underlying the recombination suppression in their hybrids, we generated a C. nigoni genome with chromosome-level contiguity and produced an improved C. briggsae genome with resolved gaps up to 2.8 Mb. The genome alignment reveals not only high sequence divergences but also pervasive intra- and inter-chromosomal sequence re-arrangements between the two species, which are plausible culprits for the observed suppression. Comparison of recombination boundary sequences suggests that recombination in the hybrid requires extensive sequence homology, which is rarely seen between the two genomes.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans. We previously reported a mouse mutant called tuft that arose spontaneously in our wild-type 3H1 colony. Adult tuft mice present midline craniofacial malformations with or without an anterior cephalocele. In addition, affected embryos presented neural tube closure defects resulting in insufficient closure of the anterior neuropore or exencephaly. Here, through whole-genome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Tet1 gene, which encodes a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET1), co-segregating with the tuft phenotype. This mutation resulted in premature termination that disrupts the catalytic domain that is involved in the demethylation of cytosine. We detected a significant loss of TET enzyme activity in the heads of tuft embryos that were homozygous for the mutation and had NTDs. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis indicated that multiple gene pathways associated with neural tube closure were dysregulated in tuft embryo heads. Among them, the expressions of Cecr2, Epha7 and Grhl2 were significantly reduced in some embryos presenting neural tube closure defects, whereas one or more components of the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway mediating planar cell polarity and convergent extension were affected in others. We further show that the recombinant mutant TET1 protein was capable of entering the nucleus and affected the expression of endogenous Grhl2 in IMCD-3 (inner medullary collecting duct) cells. These results indicate that TET1 is an epigenetic determinant for regulating genes that are crucial to closure of the anterior neural tube and its mutation has implications to craniofacial development, as presented by the tuft mouse.","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Gene expression', 'DNA mutation', 'Animal study', 'Drug development', 'Developmental biology', 'RNA', 'Biology', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

In this study, the potential for microbial reduction of native CP Fe(III) oxides was investigated, using a combination of cultivation dependent and independent approaches, to assess the potential involvement of DIR in Fe redox cycling and associated stable Fe isotope fractionation in the CP hot springs. Endogenous microbial communities were able to reduce native CP Fe(III) oxides, as documented by most probable number enumerations and enrichment culture studies. Enrichment cultures demonstrated sustained DIR driven by oxidation of acetate, lactate, and H2 . Inhibitor studies and molecular analyses indicate that sulfate reduction did not contribute to observed rates of DIR in the enrichment cultures through abiotic reaction pathways. Enrichment cultures produced isotopically light Fe(II) during DIR relative to the bulk solid-phase Fe(III) oxides.

Microarray-based gene-expression samples from eight independent CLL cohorts (1,024 untreated patients) were BAGS-stratified into pre-BI, pre-BII, immature, naïve, memory, or plasma cell subtypes; the majority falling within the memory (24.5-45.8%) or naïve (14.5-32.3%) categories. For a subset of CLL patients (n = 296), time to treatment (TTT) was shorter amongst early differentiation subtypes (pre-BI/pre-BII/immature) compared to late subtypes (memory/plasma cell, HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.78]). Particularly, pre-BII subtype patients had the shortest TTT among all subtypes. Correlates derived for BAGS subtype and IgVH mutation (n = 405) revealed an elevated mutation frequency in late vs. early subtypes (71% vs. 45%, P < .001). Predictions for BAGS subtype resistance towards rituximab and cyclophosphamide varied for rituximab, whereas all subtypes were sensitive to cyclophosphamide. This study supports our hypothesis that BAGS-subtyping may be of tangible prognostic and pathogenetic value for CLL patients.","{'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Physiology', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

perfect_match,"Adipocytes arise from the commitment and differentiation of adipose precursors in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRα, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.","{'Protein binding sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Animal study'}","{'Protein binding sites', 'Biomarkers', 'Animal study'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
perfect_match,"Tumor suppressive microRNA (miR)-150 inhibits metastasis by combining with the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) ""seed sequence"" mRNA of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Because the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) vorinostat showed excellent outcomes for treating advanced CTCL, HDACIs may reduce the metastasis of CTCL by targeting miR-150 and/ or CCR6. To examine whether these candidate molecules are essential HDACI targets in advanced CTCL, we used the My-La, HH, and HUT78 CTCL cell lines for functional analysis because we previously demonstrated that their xenografts in NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice (CTCL mice) induced multiple metastases. We found that pan- HDACIs (vorinostat and panobinostat) inhibited the migration of CTCL cells and downregulated CCR6. The miRNA microarray analysis against CTCL cell lines demonstrated that these pan-HDACIs commonly upregulated 161 miRNAs, including 34 known tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-150. Although 35 miRNAs possessing the CCR6 ""seed sequence"" were included in these 161 miRNAs, miR-150 and miR-185-5p were downregulated in CTCL cells compared to in normal CD4+ T-cells. The transduction of 12 candidate miRNAs against CTCL cells revealed that miR-150 most efficiently inhibited their migration capabilities and downregulated CCR6. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-150 was downregulated in advanced but not early CTCL primary cases. Finally, we injected miR-150 or siCCR6 into CTCL mice and found that mouse survival was significantly prolonged. These results indicate that miR-150 and its target, CCR6, are essential therapeutic targets of pan-HDACIs in advanced CTCL with metastatic potential.","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Human biology', 'Gene expression', 'Pathology', 'Animal study', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
perfect_match,"Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}","{'Genetics', 'Medicinal chemistry', 'Chemistry', 'Gene expression', 'Pharmacology', 'Genotype and phenotype', 'Biochemistry', 'Gene regulation'}",set(),1.0,1.0,1.0,set(),set(),1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
